| 0:02:45| I would like to ask about a postponement for item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| I've had several questions and texted some to the building director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| and I just have a lot of questions about the edits that we have for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| Are you asking? Are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| I'm making a motion for a postponement for 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| For two weeks. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=185)|

| 0:03:12| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| I'd like to have some discussion on that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| That was actually the item that I was going to request we vote on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| So I'm hoping that we can at least discuss it tonight and get some of our questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| There's a homeowner that's waiting on this to pass before they can build their deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| Okay, well, I can withdraw my motion to postpone and we can have the discussion at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| and consider potentially postponing it then because I have several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| I had a brief conversation with Chris Halley last week and another conversation today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| and I have some questions for engineering that may not be able to be answered tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| Anyway, I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Just point of information, maybe a middle ground between postponing and reading on first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| on emergency, it's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| It's something that's a middle path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Okay, any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| So the motion to postpone has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Are there any other items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| Seeing none, are there any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| Seeing none, is there a motion on the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=264)|

| 0:09:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| I'm wondering if there's someone who could speak to this item and the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| I'd left a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Yeah, Director Anders is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| If you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| Brad Anders, Knox County 9-1-1, 605 Bernard Avenue, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Just in general, hasn't it always been the plan to have the 9-1-1 center at the safety building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| It was brought in late in the process, but we wanted, we needed to build it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=577)|
| 0:09:45| It's actually a backup facility and an emergency operations center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| So it was always in the plan for us, and the way it maneuvered, we got the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| and then the space cost increased with URAL's cost, and so this is reflecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| for our board the increased cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| It's already been approved by our board at that amount, and we're just reflecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| changing the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| And then could you talk a bit about Sharps Ridge, and I guess...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Why don't we go ahead and vote on this one, or continue discussion on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| and Mr. Anders can come back up for the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=615)|

| 0:10:31| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=631)|

| 0:10:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Glad you're up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Can you talk about the transfer of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| I know that if you guys don't use it, it comes back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| But it's for added security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Well, when I came over there, when 9-1-1 was created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| there was a lot of handshake deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| And so this was one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| back when the city and the county came together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| to create a consolidated 9-1-1 system back in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| we inherited the radio system, the radio towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| And so there are a few towers that we have improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| We've probably spent about $4 million on this tower already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| but it's not in our name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| And so there's a city tower and a county tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| maybe two county towers that the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| we want to make it ours so we can secure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| There's some work to be done on our tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| and we're going to partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| KUB has got a tower very close to ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| and they don't have a sufficient service road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| And so we're going to create a service road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| allowing them access to work on their tower without potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| it's pretty much a hazard for them to get out of their truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| And so we're going to improve that in the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| and we're going to partner with the city and KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| to improve the area because the tower comes right up on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| So we need to make, we need to secure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| And so it's just something that we're just trying to clean up a lot of MOUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| You'll see an MOU in the next 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| codifying our relationship for dispatch services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| and things like that, that we just need to renew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| because we're operating off old agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| And so this is just part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| And Council Member Singh, I'll just add that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| you know, I'm a regular user of Sharps Ridge as a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| and this doesn't affect the trails and the use of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| And Cheryl Ely is here if you have any questions about that utilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| but you already are not supposed to get up near those towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| you know, and this doesn't change the public's ability to access the park land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| And actually we're adding, we added space to the city, the park land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| There was an encroachment with a tower next to us that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| and over time this tower had encroached onto another property owner's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| so we bought the, we paid $250,000 for the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| He then donated that land over to the legacy parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| and so I think it was about three and a half, four acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| and we're just asking to get about one or two of that back to secure the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| So we actually added to the trails for the disability trail that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| we helped add that space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| Yes, as my colleague Singh directly pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| if this is in the future no longer used for emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| it reverts back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=810)|
| 0:13:30| So that makes me completely comfortable with approving the transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| If it no longer is used by us, we're out of business, and that's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| So, but it's our main tower, it's our main facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| that's why we want to secure it the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=824)|

| 0:14:14| it's just the contract for the design inside the Public Safety Complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| wires and walls and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=859)|

| 0:14:48| I just wanted to get clarification, basically, on this real-time crime center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=888)|
| 0:14:56| the deployment of cameras, I guess, other surveillance equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=896)|

| 0:15:21| if you're up to date on the whole situation with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| just to hear a clearer explanation of it and the logic behind it, if there is any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| That concludes the people who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| And then Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| Really, I would love a presentation from the city on what this proposal is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| not just the architectural cost that we're being asked to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| but what is the purpose of a real-time crime center and how is it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| what is the planned use of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| When I reached out to the administration to ask those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| the answer that I received was that we have already had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| opportunity for public discussion on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| when city council voted on this issue in October and November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| So I looked back to see what the administration was talking about and it was the ARPA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| Funding for the real-time crime center, $150,000 was included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| as a part of the planned spending of the ARPA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| And so I went back and I watched the city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| and we had no discussion of the real-time crime center during those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| So the ARPA funds have been approved to use towards this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| The budget has money allocated towards the real-time crime center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| but there's been no discussion, no explanation to the public of how it would be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| The only thing we've had is a description that was included with the ARPA funds budget allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1025)|
| 0:17:15| and it says that the $150,000 will be added to the public safety capital project fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1035)|
| 0:17:24| in order to support the design of a real-time crime center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| This investment in technology will help law enforcement more efficiently and effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| respond to the rise in gun violence resulting from the pandemic and it's eligible under these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1055)|
| 0:17:43| So now today, we get the initial plans in this packet and it says the plan is to spend $1.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1063)|
| 0:17:55| million, of which we have not approved yet, to build this center and put cameras downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1075)|
| 0:18:04| and near the homeless shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| So we've had different explanations shared with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| for what the intended use of this real-time crime center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Once again, to me, it is using the pain that the Black community is experiencing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1096)|
| 0:18:25| And others from the gun violence in this community, but they're not shifting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| resources towards that issue and instead continuing to criminalize our unhoused neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1110)|
| 0:18:38| So I would like to hear from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1121)|
| 0:18:41| I'm going to let Chief Noel give an overview of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| We have had a change of leadership since we first started talking about this a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| and Chief Noel has had a lot of experience with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| So I have a lot of experience with the real-time crime center in New Orleans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| And the deployment of cameras would be primarily...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Could you speak a little closer to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| So the deployment of cameras would be primarily associated with dealing with violent crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| So obviously, it wasn't here when those camera sites were proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| So what I would propose that we do with the camera sites is use data analytics to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| the most efficient locations for us to effectively be able to respond to violent crime in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| communities and deploy the cameras in those areas to help us reduce violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| So I do not envision using these cameras in any way to deal with homelessness at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| It would be to help us reduce and prevent crime in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1174)|
| 0:19:42| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1184)|
| 0:19:44| Chief had a couple follow-up questions just that I got asked by some residents in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| How many cameras does KPD own now in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| I'm not aware that the Knoxville Police Department has any cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| So if we did something like this, it would be net new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| There's not any existing cameras out there owned by the city that we surveil the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| The police department does not have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| I'm not aware of other cameras that might be in city facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| The police department does not have any cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Okay, and then talk about what real-time crime monitoring is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| Is it preventative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Is it responsive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Talk about a little bit what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Sure, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| So the primary use of a real-time crime center is not, you know, real-time might be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| deceiving, but it really, the main purpose is post-incident investigative support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| So if an incident occurs, particularly a violent one, helping our investigators and our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| in the field identify who the perpetrator or perpetrators of those crimes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| For example, so if a homicide or shooting occurs at a particular location, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| it would be great if that incident would be captured on camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| That would give us real-time information to be able to spring into action and help identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| who those perpetrators are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| All too often, you know, those incidents occur not right in front of our camera, but could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| occur within several blocks of one of our cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| And the perpetrator or perpetrators, as they're fleeing or as they're going to the incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| would pass a camera, which would give us investigative leads to help us solve those cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| much more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| That's probably the biggest way that a real-time crime center would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| The second part would be support on a call for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| So if a call for service comes up, someone calls the police and says, I was just robbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| I was just shot, someone was just shot on my street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| The analyst working in the real-time crime center could then spring into action and start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| using their cameras to scan in that area to see if they see information that they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| support our officers in the field and give them information to respond more effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| and be able to render aid to potential victims and apprehend potential perpetrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| And the last piece that's used much more infrequently would be to provide situational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| awareness for large public gatherings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Like one that comes in particular is like I spent a lot of time at the World's Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| Park for the Fourth of July celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| So if we had a real-time crime center camera there, then we could provide situational awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| In this day, active shooter and other mass casualty events really aren't real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| So to be able to provide that real-time situational awareness, I think is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| But that's probably the least amount that's going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| The main thing is going to be that post-incident investigative support to really help us respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| to those incidents and bring, identify individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| We don't have any equipment to do this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| That includes software, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| So implementing such a program would require software or some technology to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| And that's not what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| It's just the wires and walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1385)|
| 0:23:05| And just to be clear, this body would approve whatever contract that is as long as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| over the threshold required for this body to review, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| The contract over a certain dollar amount, this body would approve any appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| to procure that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| And the last question is related to obviously this would be a new program or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| a new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| So this body necessarily wouldn't approve that, have legislative authority to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| that body, but a policy would have to be created, training, operational manuals within KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| So when the real-time crime center becomes live, we would create a standard operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| procedure that would govern the daily operations and the use of the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| And I promised the last question this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Those operating procedures would be based on the equipment procured by KPD, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| It would be based upon the equipment that we have in this capability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| So it's right to expect that when we approve or review appropriation of funds for certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| technology to enable this program, at that time we would see a policy of some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| how this program will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| I would be able to discuss our, to be fair, we may be procuring a pile of technology months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1459)|
| 0:24:29| and months in advance before we're ready to go live, but we would be able to discuss our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| plans with a standard operating procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1476)|
| 0:24:36| This is just the appropriation of funds for an architect that is on the center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1482)|
| 0:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1482)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Chief Noel, would this real-time crime center be able to tap into traffic cameras that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| already be in existence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1500)|
| 0:25:00| Again, that's probably a little premature right now, depending upon what technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| that we procure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| I don't know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| I could tell you in general, just from my experience in New Orleans, tapping into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| traffic cameras is a challenge because my understanding is that they only take photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| or they only take video when a violation occurs, so they're not really running 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| but I'm not completely familiar with the cameras here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| That probably would be a little bit of a challenge to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| I know that there have been some residents in the past when there's been an act of violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| that's occurred, you know, don't we have traffic cameras because the perpetrators want a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| way to help identify the suspects, and so it's good to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| And then also I know that in there's some housing communities that they do have security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| surveillance cameras for the safety of their residents, and in the past when there have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| been some horrendous acts of violence that have occurred, the footage has not been, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| quality has not been sufficient to even be able to identify or make out, you know, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| the perpetrators or suspects were, and so I would hope that at some point we might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| able to explore that, not necessarily, I know we don't have any control of the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| community surveillance cameras, but even considering something in resident, main thoroughfares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| outside of residential areas, so for example, Magnolia or MLK in certain areas, so when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| something does occur that there's at least some type of footage that we can use to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| maybe solve that a lot sooner, so I'm sure that's a different conversation down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| but I support this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| And that's why I think it's so important for us to put these cameras in locations that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| going to aid us in the investigations of violent crimes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Chief, we talked for a long time today, so I want to bring up some of those topics that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| One was the facial recognition aspect, and that's on Facebook, so I'd like you to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| So, particularly facial recognition with the real-time crime center, so, you know, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| could build technology any way you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| I'm not aware of any system that law enforcement is using that would tie in facial recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1635)|
| 0:27:24| with a live video feed to be able to track, you know, to track individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| That's not normally how law enforcement or an investigative body would use facial recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Normally, when a law enforcement body would use facial recognition, it would be post-incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| so, for example, we had, you know, a violent crime occurred and we had a still photograph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| from either a public or a private video, you know, video camera, then what we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| you know, do now is, you know, you see it on the news all the time when we run that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| still on the news and say, hey, have you seen this individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| So, the way law enforcement would typically use facial recognition would be to take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| same photograph and run it through, say, facial recognition software, and what may result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| from that would be, you know, this could be, you know, this could be your perpetrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| and that is an investigative lead just like someone calling in from the news saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| looks like the person that lives, you know, lives four streets over from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| I would not envision using facial recognition tied into live video feeds to track individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| I would not envision the use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Well, the technology, we wouldn't have access to that at this point with what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| I mean, we've not acquired any technology yet, so, I mean, I'm not a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| right now, we've not acquired any technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I would not be seeking to use facial recognition with live video tracking of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| For example, say, we want to track Paul Lowell wherever he goes to the city every time he hits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| every time he passes in front of a camera to have something over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| I'm not, I have no intention of asking for that type of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| Okay, so even using it after the fact, with facial recognition, an issue is with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| of color, it often misidentifies people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| It's hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| So that's a really big concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| The other part of the conversation we had was about home security, the bells that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| cameras, and would you be connected to that system even though the companies that make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| some of those are freely offering that to police departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| That would be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| It would depend on our technology to be able to receive that in a lot of other conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| Again, we've not acquired any technology at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| So I know the intention behind this is for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| But for me, this would make me feel less safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| With so many, you know, the things that were legal June 30th that are no longer legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| So as things progress, I would hate to see the technology increase and our rights be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| more limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| So I'm going to be voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| Just, it makes me very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| Thank you, Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Just a point of information for councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Similar to when we did not have body-worn cameras, many, many police departments around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| the country, including in Tennessee, already have real-time crime centers, including Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| Memphis, Nashville is putting theirs in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| But also communities, you know, cities larger and smaller, Montgomery, Alabama, Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| Louisville, it's, I think there are at least 100, if not more, communities that already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| are using this as part of the community safety efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| And Ms. Middlebrook, our director of community safety, and I had a chance to go down to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| the system in place in Chattanooga, I don't know, nine months ago or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| And, you know, to see how they were doing, using it in the ways that Chief Noel described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| to, you know, on a rare occasion, you know, there was an incident where the officer was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| out in the field and was, you know, wrestling with someone and needed help from his colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| but they weren't sure where he was and he happened to be inside of a camera and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| were able to go help their colleague and, you know, address the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| But more often it was investigatory after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| And I also remember hearing, and I think Ms. Middlebrook heard this more directly, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| because we're so close to Chattanooga and we have a lot of friends and family down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| and also, you know, some criminal activity that goes back and forth between our two cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| a lot of members of residents of Knoxville who have experienced a crime or been in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| community affected by violence think we already have these cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Ms. Middlebrook, did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| I mean, I think you heard that more directly from someone in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| If you could share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Well, one of the things that we hear often, kind of to the point that Councilwoman McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| was making also, because there are things like traffic cameras, because a lot of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| communities have this technology, because people see it on TV already, because some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| of our housing communities have cameras and things like that, a lot of people assume that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| this technology exists citywide and so when an incident happens and leads are not found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| and incidents are unsolved, a lot of the comment is, well, can't you just look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| camera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Didn't the camera catch it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| And we have to explain to people that we don't have that technology here in our cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you, Ms. Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| So, Mayor, I said that I knew that the intention behind this is for safety and for all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| good reasons, but still the overall effect is it makes me feel less safe about even going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| to other cities that have this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Chief Noel and I had a really good conversation about I want the community and the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| department to come to be connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| And to me, this feels like a big separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| It feels like big brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| Councilmember McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Vice-Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| I just want to go over a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| You know, so obviously we're having a much broader discussion, which I think is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| But tonight's agenda item is about physical design for a space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| And I know there's some discussion about technologies to be deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| And that's really the questions that I have for Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Chief, I think what's important here is to think about what this is and also what this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| And so what I've heard you say so far is, you know, this is really focused on reconstructing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| what happened and not on monitoring video, you know, 24-7 watching and listening to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2032)|
| 0:34:01| conversations or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| And I just want you to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Oh, great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| I mean, this is absolutely not, you know, tracking individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| You know, while we would technically have the ability to monitor cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| you know, with having, even in a place like New Orleans where you have two to four analysts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| working, they could really only look at one, you know, one camera at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| So a city like New Orleans has thousands of cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| You got to speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| A city like New Orleans only has thousands of cameras in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| There's, they don't even have any time to monitor an event because when a call comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| you know, they're trying to help on those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| So the primary, the main purpose of this is post-incident support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| There's no way to listen into conversations or even, you know, I want to just clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| I think, you know, we talked about, you know, tapping into private cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| You could not do that even if we wanted to without that individual's permission to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| able to give us permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| So this is not, you know, the ability to infiltrate into someone's or some businesses or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| individual's private surveillance or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| If that was done, it would have to be given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| But this is mostly post-incident support and support on calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| And really, you know, what this really boils down to, it's an additional tool in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| responders tool belt to really help us be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| Right now, if a crime occurs, our investigators are driving around and walking around looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| for surveillance cameras that may have captured the incident or the perpetrator fleeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| They have to look for those cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Then they actually have to knock on someone's door and ask for permission to take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| at that camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2138)|
| 0:35:38| And often what happens is they'll say, sure, come and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| I have no idea how that system works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| So this is really about aiding us and making us more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| And, I mean, that was actually the next question I was going to ask was that if you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| to have access to private, you know, videos that you would have to get permission for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| you wouldn't just be able to tap into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| We can't tap into anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| And so I think that was an important point too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| The other question I have is about deploying the cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| Could you speak, you know, more about, you know, I know we don't have any of this technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| I know we don't have the software you would need to even manage this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Again, we're just talking about, you know, a building space and a physical design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| But as you're thinking about this proposal in the future, what do you envision how you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2189)|
| 0:36:38| going to deploy cameras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| What you're going to use to guide you and where you're going to place them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2206)|
| 0:36:46| So we would have a very deliberate discussion using data analytics to determine the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| appropriate locations for us to be able to assist in solving violent crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| Post the incident occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| That would be the first thing we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| The second thing we would look at would be available infrastructure where we can install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| these cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Just because we all agree that location X is the best place to put a camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| There needs to be the infrastructure, the power pole able to receive power and able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| to hold these, to transmit this data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| So the second piece is that infrastructure, being able to house the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| And the third piece would be, you know, really ideally what we want to, you know, use first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| is those locations, those major thoroughfares where people are going to go to and from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| or, you know, if you have certain neighborhoods that experience more violence than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| places where if a crime would occur, that we would be more likely than not to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| to view that individual going to or from that incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| That's really what I would be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2270)|
| 0:37:50| Again, all revolved around violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Council Member McKenzie, or Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| I've been wanting to follow up ever since Council Member Smith's questions, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2281)|
| 0:38:09| most important thing I want to say is New Orleans has a surveillance ordinance in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2289)|
| 0:38:17| And that was a surveillance ordinance passed by their city council to put rules in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| regarding the use of surveillance technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| So New Orleans is not able to use facial recognition technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| New Orleans is not able to use characteristic recognition and tracking software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| New Orleans is not able to use predictive policing, nor is it able to use cell site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| simulators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| We haven't had a discussion as a community of the restraints that we might want to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| on the use of surveillance technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| New Orleans had banned license plate readers, just as Nashville had banned license plate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| readers, and both have pulled back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| That's something I would agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| So there's some technology that can be used, but when we're talking about all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| cameras, just as Councilwoman McKenzie stated, they are known to have bad quality that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2353)|
| 0:39:24| not reliable, and we're not able to distinguish characteristics of people of color and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| And so they, and when I looked into Chattanooga, when I raised this issue, it was brought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2372)|
| 0:39:41| my attention that when Chattanooga had a mass shooting this year, their surveillance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| cameras malfunctioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| And so now, this year, they invested another $573,000 just to purchase, I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2390)|
| 0:40:00| 25 surveillance cameras to replace the old and to get some new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| So for me, I can't support this because we put no constraints in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| We act as if we do not have the legislative authority to pass an ordinance to put some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| restraints in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| It's a bad investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| You can't rely on the quality of the, of what's produced by these cameras, and as Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2425)|
| 0:40:36| says, the rain, the cold, the heat, the snow, all of those break down this technology, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| it's something you have to constantly replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| And we are moving full steam ahead with an annual investment that hasn't been proven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2445)|
| 0:40:55| to us to be effective, and it is going to require significant funding to maintain and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| replace when we need it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| I feel like it is our responsibility to have a broader conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| I've asked for the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| We could have had a workshop on this topic less than two weeks ago, but we couldn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| the folks in the room to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| I have an ordinance ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| And my ordinance doesn't even ban as much as New Orleans bans, but it has some guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| rails in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| It bans facial recognition technology, I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| Also, New Orleans Pre-Surveillance Ordinance does not allow their police department to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| share that data with immigration officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| That's a conversation that we could have as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2503)|
| 0:41:52| Instead of just giving free rain and, oh, the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| I can't pull it all up right now, but this has been on my radar for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| Yeah, I think it's been a couple of years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| And I did a webinar with the ACLU on what information they found about surveillance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| technology being acquired by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| I asked my questions, trying to get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| We have technology that has the capacity to do facial recognition, but I've been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| we don't use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| That's all I know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| We need a larger discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| I've been told that KPD can use drug money for these purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| I've been told that there is grant money that doesn't come before city council that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| KPD can use towards these purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| So until we put an ordinance in place that creates some rules for the use of surveillance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| technology and requires the approval of the use of surveillance technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| Because another way they can get around it is to not purchase it themselves, but to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| someone else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| Tap into someone else's, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| A surveillance ordinance would cover all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| And there's absolutely, in my opinion, no reason to rush forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| Public safety center ain't built yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| We have an opportunity as a community to have this discussion and decide what we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| authorize our police department to do and what we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| So for that reason, I can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| And my preference would be that we delay this item until we get a surveillance ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Council Member Puget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Council Member Puget, and then we'll go to Mackenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| I was just going to say, I intend to support this because all we're voting on tonight is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| a design for a center that we might use at a future date when decisions have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| And if we don't do the design and build it now, it will only cost more money later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| And it is wise to do design work as a facility is being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| And since it's $89,000 for design work, I intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| I agree that there are lots of questions to be answered, but this is a contract to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| an architect to help design a center if it were to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Council Member Mackenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| And so I also would be interested when we get to that point, because again, today we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| are only voting on the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| When we get to the semantics of quality of equipment, those types of things, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| like to have an additional conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| I would support that even in a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| But I'll say on behalf of families in my community who have lost children and loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| ones, would they be in favor of some type of traffic camera or something that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| have identified, and some of these are still unsolved and open cases, any type of lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| to answer the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| And when there is a family out there where there was a witness to a murder, and the witness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| backed out of coming to court to testify, and there was nothing else tying this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| to the murder of this other person, the victim, who's no longer in custody, where a camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| potentially could have captured this person's car leaving that scene and been some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| of indication without a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| And so because of that, I'm in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| I am concerned about some controls around that, but I don't think that's the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| particularly for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| So I just wanted to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| I know that what we're voting on today is the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| But this is also the first chance that we've had to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| So I'm glad that we're having that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| There are a lot of things that have come up on council that we keep saying, we will get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| there, we will get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| This is just a step in the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| And it just moves along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So that's why I'm paying attention to this center right now at this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| But it just feels like a lot of government overreach to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| Council Member Reitrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| I would like to ask the chief, could you comment on, you were in New Orleans for a while, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| So were you there for the process of discussing what could and couldn't be done and what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2825)|
| 0:47:14| ordinances are that govern the real-time camera use down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| Because I'm trying to find it online and not quite getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| Yes, I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Yes, I was there for the building and the equipping of the real-time crime center and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| the discussions and the ongoing discussions on the surveillance ordinance in New Orleans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| So did the local governing body there put regulations and restrictions on, as Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| Parker described?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| I mean, I'd like to hear your side of what was restricted and what was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| So the New Orleans City Council banned facial recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| Right before I left, they were having active discussions with the police department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| city administration to reverse that ban with a policy on facial recognition, which the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| police department did not have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| And I don't want to speak for the discussions now because I've not been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I've not been employed there since May 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| But the discussions that I was heavily involved in before I left, there was discussions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| lift that ban once the police department created a policy regulating the use and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| approval of facial recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| The other things in the surveillance ordinance did not affect the operation of the real-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2907)|
| 0:48:36| crime center at all, as the real-time crime center is not designed at using cell site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| simulators or tracking or predictive policing or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| Basically, it's that technology hub where the camera information comes and then we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Same thing with facial recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Facial recognition would not be a function of a real-time crime center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| That would be an investigative tool post-incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| That would be an investigative what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| An investigative tool post an incident occurs, so post a violent crime occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| So just the same way someone commits a shooting and then we have a still photograph of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| potential perpetrator, the potential use of facial recognition would be to take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| photograph, run it through the facial recognition software, and then that software would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| this could potentially be this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| That would not be a function of the real-time crime center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| That would be a post-incident follow-up investigative function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| So the New Orleans surveillance ordinance did not really affect the real-time operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| of the real-time crime center in New Orleans at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| It affected the way the city of New Orleans and the police department used technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| post-investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Well, just a quick update that I talked to Chief Knoll about the discussions in New Orleans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| and just wanted to update you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| I've been following that and there was a proposal to pull back on those bans, but it came before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| city council and they rejected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| So those bans remain in place under New Orleans surveillance ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Seeing no further questions or discussion, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3013)|

| 0:50:53| I have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Just because these are ARPA dollars and reading through the description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3055)|
| 0:51:04| it seems like S&ME was offering to determine how to prioritize projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3064)|
| 0:51:12| if the city was too overwhelmed to do it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| I was quite uncomfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| And also, honestly, with the lack of transparency around the chief of police search and the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3080)|
| 0:51:29| that we voted to hand that process over to an outside company, I'm concerned about handing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| the management of these ARPA funds over to another entity where we might not have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| oversight as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| As we would if it were managed by the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| Those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Deputy Gill, did you have some clarification on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Yes, and I'm looking at Mr. Clabo to confirm, but these are the $20 million, Mayor, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| TDEC has specifically passed through to the city, which can be used exclusively on a subset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| of engineering-related infrastructure projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| And would not be the broader ARPA funds that this body has considered that are much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| relevant to social services and addressing the negative impacts of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3138)|

| 0:52:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Tom Clabo, Deputy Engineering Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| The projects, the subset of projects that this funding is for include stormwater type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| projects, water system improvements, and wastewater improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| And could you clarify how the projects are identified for use of these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| Mr. Clabo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| The intent with the S&ME contract is to get them to help us administer the total grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| funding, so that process will include, there will be an application process through TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| so they'll help us identify potential projects that the administration approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| But those individual projects, I would expect, would come back before this body through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3187)|
| 0:53:15| grant funding procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| So, I would expect that the legislative body would have a chance to look at those again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| This really has to do with what Councilwoman Parker brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| When Council approves a consultant, the consultant's information is no longer public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3213)|
| 0:53:41| record, or can Council get some of that information as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| Mr. Law Director, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| The question is about the, well, would you repeat that please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Yeah, I did hear that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| I thought you were asking me if I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| No, I don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| If these records are developed in conjunction with the city, and as a part of the city project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| and are shared with the city, then they become public records because they're shared with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| There are some records that may be developed by an outside contractor that are not shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| with the city that may remain the records of the independent contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| But that would not be the case with these types of records because it's specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| a consulting contract to work with our engineering department to develop projects for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| So all of those records are going to be public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| Mr. Clabo, you tell me if you think I'm wrong about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| And this project would be managed by our stormwater engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| Thank you for the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| It's good to hear that this is all going to be public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| But my concern is other things that we vote on when there is a consultant involved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| it's not public records or the council doesn't get to see what it is exactly that we approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3307)|

| 0:56:42| It also struck me that we have, we're approving funding for 67 total curb cuts and this increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3402)|
| 0:56:56| of $121,000 is the result, it seems, of a change order to allow us to add nine curb cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3416)|
| 0:57:06| And so, we have an increase in price of almost 30% just to add nine curb cuts to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3426)|
| 0:57:21| It doesn't seem like a good use of our funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3441)|

| 0:57:27| Is there a reason why nine additional curb cuts cost $121,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3447)|

| 0:57:34| Yes, so the amendment also addresses some curb cuts and sidewalk replacement around the TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3454)|
| 0:57:43| towers along Summit Hill Drive, Union, and Walnut Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3463)|

| 0:58:02| The nine are up at, includes those that MLK at Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3482)|

| 0:59:47| It seems like this project has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| Would anyone like to share the updates on this project so the public is aware of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| we're at with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Mr. Klubo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| So the purpose of this amendment, in going through the environmental and NEPA process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3598)|
| 1:00:07| we were looking at different alternatives with CAD related to the bus routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| The initial project scope included a kind of a parallel express route along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| As we analyzed that, we realized that the actual time saved was not as significant as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| So there's a lot going on in that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| It's a very tight corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| So we ended up going back and looking at combining Route 22 with this express route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3632)|
| 1:00:41| So there will still be opportunities in the route to have some cue jumping signals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3641)|
| 1:00:50| some different things to help speed up the route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| There's also planned enhancements for the bus stops, which are very much needed along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| But we've come to a point now to where we've fully identified what the project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| And so we've got a clear path forward now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| So I would expect that we're going to see a lot more momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3668)|

| 1:03:51| Yeah, I'd like to start with some questions for Mr. Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| Um, so, and I'll preface that by saying, you may correct me and say something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| I think that this impacts maybe a third of the houses in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| Would you think that's possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| I had the same conversation with our Chris Halley and we had a tough time, maybe 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| Okay, it's quite a chunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| We'll say at least 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| I'm going to say 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| Um, and I'll set the conversation and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| So, historically speaking, the city was platted out and surveyed and lots were created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| In a historic neighborhood near downtown, subdivisions were created and all these 50-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| lots were created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Sometimes people built their house on top of two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| I believe the mayor's house straddles two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| Just pointing at you, you got a lot line going down between the middle of your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| I used to have a lot line that was stray on my property because my property was built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| on a 50-foot lot plus a 10-foot segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| And because no one ever replatted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| So, we have these maps that go back to the 1800s and nothing was ever fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| And time over and again, things were built and were built and were built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| Nothing was fixed on the city ward map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| And at some point in history, it was decided that everybody who wanted a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| needed to pay for a survey to be able to put a deck on, add a 10-by-10 shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3920)|
| 1:05:27| And so about 25% of the population has to shell out no less than $2,000 or more to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| those lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Mine only got fixed because I happened to buy a driveway next door to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| And since I couldn't have a 15-foot segment, I had to pay for my survey to purchase that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3946)|
| 1:05:46| And so when I went to go build building permits, pull a building permit for my property, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| wasn't an impact to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| But I have a lot of constituents who have asked for help with this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| And I just want to preface, since I talked about a postponement earlier, my concern with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| this, and I realize this was presented to me as a partial fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| There are other parts of the code that need to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| My concern is the fix that's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| I have a lot of questions about this particular fix not being enough of a fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| And I don't want to adopt and codify requiring a survey that is not in any language in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| And so that is why I was seeking a two-week postponement to have some of those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| because I'm just not sold on, and I've never gotten a solid answer on, why we must make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| people like Mr. Ryan, who may be here, I may have pronounced that incorrectly, pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=3994)|
| 1:06:42| the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| We issued him a building permit somewhere prior to 1985 for a house to get built, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| him particularly, but whoever built the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| And now that he wants to build a deck, he has to pay no less than probably several thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Tonight's proposed ordinance change would make it so he could pay no less than $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| So I'm not sure if that's a low enough bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| I think we could possibly do better, and that's where I have questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| So I'll turn it over to you, Mr. Clabo, to explain differently than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| It's my understanding that this is one piece of what needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| The other is related to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| So this particular ordinance would allow a single family or a duplex to go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4041)|
| 1:07:32| permitting process as long as they did have a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| So they don't have to go through the platting, necessarily the platting process, the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| So it's going to save them some time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Because they don't have to file with the Planning Commission and have it officially platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| That's the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| But it specifically addresses those types of improvements that, just like a deck, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| that's kind of in the shadow of the house, if you want to think of it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| It doesn't affect building setbacks or those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| So it's a very limited amount of work you could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| It addresses the engineering aspect of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| We would be allowed to issue a permit based on a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| But there's still, if you're going to do more than that, additions, there's another piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| of the zoning ordinance we'd have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| So to get a building permit, somebody already has to submit plans that are going to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| where the setbacks are and where the property lines are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| An example of one of my more recent neighbors that brought this up and was quoted $4,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| for the needed survey with the way the ordinance reads before we vote on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| The minimum charge was $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| I called that surveyor today, because they're one that I've used before, and said, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| if we pass this ordinance tonight, what's the bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| And they told me no less than $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| So before it was $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Now it's $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| If we were to pass this tonight, my neighbor could put up a 10 by 10 shed for $1,000 survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| cost in addition to what they're spending on the architect who's identifying where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| setbacks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| And that is because they have a lot created by deed, not by on the ward map originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4158)|
| 1:09:26| So it's where sick people subdivided property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| So for Mr. Ryan or Ryan, again, I don't know if he's here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| That was the one that we had all gotten an email about at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| When I go look at the KGIS record for that particular property, it references a 1996| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| And it gives all the descriptions of that property in the survey and the recording of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| the deed, the lot by deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| What happened to that survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| It just didn't get recorded with the planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| Like, I'm trying to figure out why it requires an additional survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| It's clearly been surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4204)|
| 1:10:04| And I don't think I could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| So was there, as far as a legal description, but was there also a survey map produced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4208)|
| 1:10:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4216)|
| 1:10:16| What's attached to KGIS is the deed, the quick claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4216)|
| 1:10:25| And in the quick claim deed, it describes, if you go further down, it gives the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| specific Schedule A description, and it gives all of, you know, existing PIN, the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| PIN point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| It tells you all the PIN points for the measurement of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| And then at the bottom, it says, according to the survey of Wade B. Nance, surveyor dated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| 29th of March, 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| So this property has been surveyed, but somehow that survey didn't end up somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| So we're going to make the property owner survey something again, and we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| give them a lesser survey requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| So they don't have to have a $4,000 survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| They just need, like, I believe the owner got an, I believe in the email, he got an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| $850 survey was the one he could find to meet the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| It's just that our ordinance didn't allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| He needed to go back and get the more expensive one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| I guess my argument is, I'm not convinced that he's required to do, that he needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| be required to do the $850 survey, which is why I'd like to postpone it and have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| I don't want to pass something tonight that requires him to do $850 worth of survey work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| which I believe he's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| But again, my neighbor, I don't know that I, and I'm just using one example because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| I'm going to tell you a minimum of 25% of my neighborhoods in my district, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| they're so old, will require this type of work just to do permitted work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| So what we're doing is we're forcing people to pay for surveys that I question whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| are necessary, or we're telling them just do the work without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| And that's not what we want either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| We want them to have safe decks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| We want to have inspected work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| I just would like more conversation to find out why are we insisting, and I will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| I had a conversation several years back when I was first on council with Jim Hagerman about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| why we are doing, why we do it this way, and the answer was kind of because, and somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| has to pay to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| I just don't, I just haven't gotten a satisfactory answer as to why we're doing it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| So that's my thing as to why I can't support voting for this tonight, and I will make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| motion to postpone for two weeks to have further conversations with Mr. Ahrens and Mr. Howley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| and others in engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| That's my thing, and I'll be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Okay, motion made to postpone this item for two weeks has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| So, Ms. Council Member Fugate, did you want to speak to the motion on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4368)|
| 1:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4378)|

| 1:15:10| That is not a district that we have found existing cultural facilities to exist within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4510)|

| 1:17:59| Well, I'm not necessarily unsupporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| I just I want to point out that there's a reference to our noise ordinance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| And historically speaking, we've had issues with enforcement of our noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| And I think that that is something I just want to take this time to say that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| we definitely need to work on because in conversations with KPD, they only certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4697)|
| 1:18:24| vehicles have ways to measure the noise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| And then the way it's measured is controversial as well in terms of it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4707)|
| 1:18:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| It's not really measurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| I think it's really the conversation that I hadn't asked with Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| So we're passing something that references the noise ordinance that needs quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Well, just a point of information, Vice Mayor Roberto, I believe you've planned a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| on some aspects of the noise detector issues later this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| Yes, Mayor, we've got a workshop scheduled, but that's dealing with the noise from vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| traffic, the downtown pilot program with dealing with traffic noise, which is really, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| looking at modified mufflers or no muffler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| My question, and I apologize for being ignorant on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| How do you have, what is a certificate of compliance for the noise ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| How does it exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| How does one get this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| We anticipated noise being a potential problem and trying to capture it on the back end is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| And so there's engineers for just about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| And so we anticipate requiring a sound engineer to identify what the typical boarding facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4790)|
| 1:19:58| noise levels are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| And through a design, whether it be sound deadening materials of the construction methods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| identifying that those noise levels will be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| So we want to capture that on the front end versus trying to catch it on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| So as I understand it, this doesn't exist yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| We don't have an existing certificate, but this is so that a facility will be designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| to meet the noise ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| Yes, because right now, overnight boarding is very limited to ag districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4829)|
| 1:20:37| And so with the inclusion into other areas, we anticipated noise being more of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| And so we wanted to try and capture that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| So just, I'm sorry, now I'm on a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| So I assume this is, you know, like vets in residential neighborhoods, other sorts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4847)|
| 1:20:55| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4855)|
| 1:20:55| I mean, I'm just trying to get a sense of how widespread this is, what we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| about, because it sounds good on paper, but people will be curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| This came about when a small animal care facility came in to get a permit for my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4869)|
| 1:21:18| And we saw that they were anticipating boarding well more than five animals overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| So we classified them as a kennel and an animal care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| And that triggered all the other stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4892)|
| 1:21:32| And they weren't going to be zoned in a place that could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| It was a commercial zone, which allowed for the animal care facility, but not the overnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| boarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4900)|
| 1:21:40| So it's really just those facilities that, through their business model, are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| be boarding more than, well, yeah, boarding more than five animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| Well, I mean, just for me, right off the top of my head, most vets board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| And so what it sounds to me like is only vets who were in certain areas could meet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4922)|
| 1:22:02| And if you were a vet in a more residential sort of area, you might not have qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| I'm just trying to figure out if that's how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| You don't have to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| You don't have to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4934)|

| 1:22:25| If the certificate, as I read it, would apply to the kennels, or would it be all animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| care facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Just those that are boarding overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| And so is there a permit that a groomer can get that is not boarding overnight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| Can they get an animal care facility permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| When they get their permit, we look at their floor plans to ensure compliance, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| with the building code, but also with the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| We understand that their animal care facilities can do multiple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| And when we see, say, a large room lined with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| kennels, cages, that's when we say, we'll ask the question, are you planning to board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| overnight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| And if the answer is yes, then we'll require some level of certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4994)|
| 1:23:14| So we're changing the ordinance, and that impact will impact the definition for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| animal care facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| All animal care facilities will now be able to board overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| But when they go to get their permit, they need to disclose whether they will be a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| that boards overnight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| OK, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| And if you are not boarding overnight, there are noâ€”I have, there's a little animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| there's a little pet grooming business near where I live, well, where I used to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5028)|
| 1:23:57| And it's a tiny little building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| I don't believe they board overnight, but I was worried about a little business like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| that whoseâ€”the business gets a little bit more complicated with this change, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5045)|

| 1:24:16| I don't think it makes it more complicated for that example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| I think it gives them more opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| And if they take advantage of those opportunities, we just want to make sure that they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| having a negative impact on you, their neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5065)|

| 1:24:34| Director Brooks, there was definitely some discussion about where the small care, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| the animal care facility, small animal, is, could potentially be, you know, in a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5081)|

| 1:25:05| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| I would have to pull up the zoning ordinance here just to confirm, butâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| And the previous item that we talked about extended that as a special use in CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5112)|
| 1:25:19| So we're not talking about extending this into residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5124)|

| 1:25:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5128)|
| 1:25:28| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| What about the facilities that are already in residential neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5130)|

| 1:25:42| They will be able to get a certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| If they expand their facility to include boarding overnight, that would be a change in how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5153)|
| 1:25:53| And that's when we would require the certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5156)|

| 1:34:17| idea then in sections as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5657)|

| 1:37:05| Council members, we have two people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| First is Michelle Bradford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Miss Bradford, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5830)|
| 1:37:18| Please come to the podium and you can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| Please start by stating your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5844)|
| 1:37:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Michelle Bradford, address 7310 Bennington Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5855)|
| 1:37:42| How are you all doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| First, I just want to say to Mrs. Parker, I'm encouraged to hear your concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| the real-time surveillance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| So I've been editing while sitting back there, so I've got to navigate scribbles and arrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5875)|
| 1:38:03| So if five minutes isn't enough, if there aren't others for public forum, is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| way I could maybe have 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5891)|
| 1:38:11| That'll be up to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5893)|
| 1:38:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| So if I don't, yeah, there's just so much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| I would love to talk with any of you more about this at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| I can't really fit much into this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| But this is an RF meter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| It measures wireless radiation, also called non-ionizing radiation, microwave radiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5911)|
| 1:38:39| and another one I can't think of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| But it measures from 200 megahertz to 8 gigahertz, which includes T-Mobile's low-band 5G network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| frequencies, but not the mid-band or high-band frequencies that AT&T and Verizon are using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| And I will just measure different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| And even just driving around town, the levels are pretty concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5937)|
| 1:39:05| Here is a list from the BioInitiative report showing some of the published peer-reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| science showing the biological effects at levels within what the meter is showing when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5950)|
| 1:39:16| driving around town now with all of the 5G antennas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| And I'll just read some of these real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Fatigue, depressive tendencies, sleeping disorders, concentration difficulties, cardiovascular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5961)|

| 1:39:37| radiofrequency radiation linked to adverse neurological cardio systems and cancer risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=5977)|

| 1:40:31| impaired nervous system activity, induced DNA damage in cells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| You get the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| You know, it does a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| The FCC set their limits based on heating effect alone and not the biological effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6037)|
| 1:40:45| And it affects us biologically in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| Some people more than others based on unique biology from person to person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| different symptoms from person to person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| But the FCC did lose a lawsuit last year for ignoring thousands of studies that show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| biological harm within their current limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| And even within their current limits, some of the 5G, this is a copy from one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6064)|
| 1:41:16| 5G antenna applications for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| And on it, it says, on this tower, radiofrequency fields near some antennas may exceed FCC rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| for human exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| The limits already aren't safe, and they're even going past that with these antennas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| T-Mobile, they went live with their low-band frequencies December 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| and AT&T and Verizon have continued to set up more of theirs these past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| So with the FCC losing that lawsuit, it could create more liability for those in positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6102)|
| 1:41:48| with a responsibility to protect people from harm and a greater need to learn what actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| protective measures need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| And I'm just wanting to ask for protective city ordinances to be put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| Protective city ordinances be written that will protect, at the least, schools and property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| rights from harmful levels of wireless radiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| I realize there are probably contracts that have already been signed with telecom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| regarding the 5G network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| But, you know, it really comes down to the city choosing which liability risk to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6137)|
| 1:42:24| either a possible telecom lawsuit to break contracts and remove 5G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| or keeping 5G and allowing its own citizens to continue to be harmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| as well as possible citizen lawsuits from them being harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| But even if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6159)|

| 1:42:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Could I share any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| There may be council members who are happy to speak to you after the conclusion of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6165)|
| 1:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6173)|

| 1:43:23| So, concerning some of the things that were brought up earlier today and that I had spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| to earlier, and maybe have something to do with what this young lady just got through speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6208)|
| 1:43:36| about, when I was attending park meetings through the last several years, I have a bad habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6216)|

| 1:43:51| I'll just look up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| ADHD, I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| And I've noticed that there are phenomenon that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| And one of those phenomenon is our drones and surveillance drones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6241)|
| 1:44:08| And I've asked the police department at park meetings on the record and off the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| I got one response one time that was informative because I didn't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| And at the time, Assistant Chief Miller was part of a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| And at the state level, he was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| He had just come back from Nashville to testify, testifying about increasing and expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6269)|

| 1:44:42| And, you know, the past two and a half years, well, for past 20 years, we've lost a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6282)|
| 1:44:51| of liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6291)|

| 1:45:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| We need protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| And, Chief, I heard you trying to address the use of technology and cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6304)|
| 1:45:13| And, you know, I've had been on the negative side of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6313)|
| 1:45:22| I've been on the negative side of tag readers because the funny thing about technology is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| it doesn't do any good unless people are using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| And so, it depends on what the people that are using it want to do with it determines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| whether or not it's good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| And so, we have to be, I think we should be very careful when we start talking about making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6338)|
| 1:45:47| the public aware of how much they are surveilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| You know, I've been pulled over several times and the tag reader was used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| The tag reader was used here in Knoxville, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| And for whatever reason, it did not impress me about the educational level of some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| those officers because when I finally had enough of it and I went to a park meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| and related that situation, that violent situation, the training session at that meeting just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| happened to be about what happens when a policeman pulls over a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| And we went through it with now, I think he's now Lieutenant Watson, went through the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| training scenario, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| And we ended up having myself being used as the typical person being pulled over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6394)|
| 1:46:42| And so, I acted like a normal disgruntled person would and I relied on my own experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6402)|
| 1:46:49| okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| I learned a little bit about what my rights are when I'm pulled over and what should and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| should not be asked of me when I'm pulled over and what I can ask of that officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6415)|
| 1:47:04| And I've had officers tell me, no, no, you don't have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| You can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| No, you need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| So, that's one aspect of surveillance using technology that we all need to be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| that particular communities and particular people, primarily people of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| people of African descent, people who are speaking Spanish and they are stereotyped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6445)|
| 1:47:32| Let's not be silly about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| They are stereotyped also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| So, you know, Seema, you might have been in a few situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| Okay, maybe you used Trump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Okay, okay, we'll talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| So, that's, those are the things that we, I think you all as city council and law directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6468)|
| 1:47:54| need to be very clear on about what the city's role is, about any city department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6474)|
| 1:48:01| primarily law enforcement's role is in the use of technology in the surveillance mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| So, with that last 10 seconds, you guys just really need to start really focusing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6488)|
| 1:48:16| Our liberties are being eroded and you all are complying with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6496)|
| 1:48:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Council, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220712?start=6504)|
