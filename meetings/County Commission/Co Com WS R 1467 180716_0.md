| 0:08:16| and there are six-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| The qualifications are that they have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| duly qualified electors and taxpayers of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| and that they cannot be an officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| an employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| The county IDB deals with really a variety of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| I've been before you on a few, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| such as economic development, bond issuances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| infrastructure, property development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| and the most commonly that you'll hear of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| would be PILOTs and TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| And then the Health Ed Board really primarily works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| on your behalf, on behalf of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| for taxes and bond issuances for hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| educational facilities, and multifamily housing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| And the directors are your appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| but we have made a practice at commission's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| to send forth at least a list of nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| In addition to that, going back now for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| we have tried to send multiple nominees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| rather than just the number of appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| that you had to fill so that you had a choice to select from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| And I would also state that commissioners have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| and have in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| and have the absolute right to present their own nominees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| individuals, in addition to what we present to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| In your board packages, and if you don't have a copy of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| we've got some handouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| because it was actually just last week on the 10th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| that the full IDB was actually able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| and consider the nominees of its nominating committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| So there are six individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Would anybody like a copy of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Are you good in your package?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Ray will pass those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=603)|

| 0:10:10| there's three slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Two of the three members whose terms are up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| are willing to serve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Those are Paul Fortunato and Trey Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Paul just retired after 36 years with Dow Chemical Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| Trey is a market president with Home Trust Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| There are four new names for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| That's Richard Matlock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Richard's an attorney with the law firm of Wolf McClain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=632)|

| 0:10:46| And Mike George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| Five of these nominees, Paul Fortunato, Richard Matlock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| Jan Brown, and Tiffany Gardner, and Mike George are all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| And I would respectfully request, if you would permit them the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| just at least the opportunity to come up and introduce themselves to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| so that when you vote next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| you will have a little better understanding about ones maybe you have not met before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| You all good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=673)|

| 0:11:26| As Todd mentioned, I actually serve on the current board, and my term is due up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| and I've been asked if I would consider serving a second six-year term, and I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| I have just recently retired from Dow Chemical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Started with Roman Haas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Most folks know of Roman Haas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Not everybody knows of Dow Chemical, but we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| And have lived in Knoxville for over 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| and would like a chance to be on the board again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| With my industrial background, I really do believe I bring a knowledge base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| that is helpful to be on the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| It gives me an opportunity to try to do what I think is right for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| in terms of bringing the right kind of incentives for businesses and industry into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| I think it's very important for our livelihood, for our tax base, and for our growth in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| so I appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=737)|

| 0:12:34| Not brave enough to actually run for office like you brave fellows and ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| I've been working at Wolf, McLean for, well, since we opened the doors about 25 years ago here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| and have represented a number of companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| a number of businesses that had opportunity to qualify for TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| IDB has helped over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| and would like to be able to work for my county and bring more to them and to my county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| So I appreciate the consideration and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| Hi, my name is Jan Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| I've been in Knoxville for almost 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| I came here to go to graduate school at the University of Tennessee, focused on mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| I've been at TVA now for almost 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| I'm its ethics manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| In terms of my involvement in Knox County, I have been a member of the Knoxville Opera Board of Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| where I had the pleasure of chairing the 2015 and 2016 Rossini Festivals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| Those were very memorable times for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| And also I serve on the Knoxville Area Urban League Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| and I've been on that board for a number of years now, and I'm currently serving as the secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| I look forward to the opportunity to work in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| I volunteer with United Way, volunteer with TVA activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| so thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| Hi, I'm Tiffany Gardner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| I'm with First Tennessee Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| As Todd mentioned, I've been a Knoxville resident all my life, born and raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| I went to Carnes High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| I did spend about 12 years over in Hickory, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| I've been back now since 2006, working with First Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| As Jan mentioned, just like her, I've served in the community in several different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| Big Brothers, Big Sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| I was there for six years as well as the board chair for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| I have just rolled off of the Knox County, or excuse me, sorry, the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| I just rolled off of that, and I'm looking forward to this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| So I do consider, I appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| Obviously with my banking background, I feel like it would be a big benefit to be able to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| in evaluating the things that we're looking for for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=889)|
| 0:14:58| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| I'm Michael George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| I'm vice president of business development for Blaine Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| I hold a degree from the School of Architecture at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| The reason I'm going to be on this board is a couple of years from now I hope to retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| so I'll have a lot of time to spend and need something to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| But I also think my background in construction, design, and economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| could bring something that other board members could bounce off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| I've worked for years with the state of Tennessee, ECD, local people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| on trying to recruit business to the state, and I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| So I would like this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| I'd just like to know what the procedural requirement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| if the commission needs to advance another recommendation to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| These boards will be filled by the recommended nominations from Todd's group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| but the commission can nominate anybody they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| You go through the voting process to eliminate by majority each name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| as we normally do under your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| So these are the recommendations that are coming from the professional organization to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| but it's the pleasure of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=982)|

| 0:18:12| It's Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| It's appointing or reappointing an individual for district six seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1094)|

| 0:18:30| I need to back up, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| We didn't vote to move this to the regular meeting, the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| So we have a motion and a second to move without recommendation to next Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1117)|

| 0:18:59| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| The next item is 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| It's Resolution 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| It's approving a memorandum of understanding with the Great Schools Partnership for Fiscal Year 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| grant funding in the amount of $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| On this, I need to ask one of the, somebody from the board, our board director here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| Mr. Thomas, Superintendent Thomas or somebody about this Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| I see that we got $125,000 that we get this grant from them on this, what they call, teacher-preneur, I guess is how you pronounce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1179)|
| 0:19:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Teacher-preneur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Teacher-preneur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| I know, that's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| But anyway, and this has been going on, what, since 2016?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| Commissioner Stephanie Welch is here from the partnership, so let her follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| Stephanie, if you would, please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Yes, Stephanie Welch, 3213 South Haven Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| I'm the president of Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Thanks for your question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| The first year for teacher-preneur was in the school year 2014-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Well, I saw some of the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| It sounds like a great program going on, but a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| In 2016, I think, what, was it still $125,000 given back then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| It's been about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| We actually got some external grant funding at one point, and there was a little bit more money in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| The only reason why I was doing that, I noticed back in 2016 that the total grant money of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| the teachers that were given this grant to do their exercise or to develop these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1257)|
| 0:21:06| total to me on what was online was like about $63,771.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| That funding, was that still left in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| or did they have to return that money that was not spent on that grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| So we may budget for an amount, and we don't always award the total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| So we award the amount that the school teacher designates for their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| They don't receive more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| We fund them for the amount that their proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| So we're budgeting $125,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| But they don't always use it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| That's absolutely correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| Okay, now, if you develop a program, a teacher comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| I think one that I read about was a robotics program that I think they got about $20,000 for, and it sounded great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| And if there was an innovation that came out of that that was going to be used to expand to other educational facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1319)|
| 0:22:08| other than Knox County, and it was being sold to those different counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| who would get that money that this technology would be sold to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| That's a great question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| We have not licensed any of the products from this particular program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| and that's something we could certainly look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| That's not a situation that's arisen yet, but that would be wonderful if it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| But if you do have one that's come in there, it would go, what, to the school system for them to license and sell, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| I think we'd have to talk with the superintendent and his office and the law director about how to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| But that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| We'll ask that of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Item number 18, resolution 212, is approving a school group agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| with the Great Smoky Mountains Institute of Tremont for Lonsdale Elementary School's fifth grade trip at a cost of $15,444.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1393)|
| 0:23:23| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| Super Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| Super Bob, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| This is coming out of school's funds, this $15,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| There's a grant that covers a portion of it, then the schools are going to raise the additional money at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| The reason I ask that is because I may have a couple of schools in my district that would love to go to Tremont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| so I'm trying to figure out how we might be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| So it is partially grant and partially funded by parents or school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Yes, that would be the fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Commissioner Carrington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Yes, I just want to reemphasize what a great trip that Tremont is for the elementary students to get to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1454)|
| 0:24:24| I'll tell you how long Shannondale Elementary's been going, since I was there, since my middle brother was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| And even back then, Carson, we sold things and there was help from our PTA, which was PTA then, but now I believe they're PTSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1471)|
| 0:24:44| So it is an awesome, I still remember every, I can't remember some things I did yesterday or this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| but I still remember everything that we learned and did at Tremont when I was in sixth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| So I was really happy to see that this school was getting the chance to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| It is a great trip, great learning experience for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| I think it's about 70 students that will be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Commissioner Schoenmacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Mr. Superintendent, on your fiscal note, it says that the funding comes from Mount Rest grant held by Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1515)|
| 0:25:24| Who's Mount Rest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| I'll, Commissioner, have to let the partnership respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| Okay, and it says here it's $198 a person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| I believe that's correct, and of course chaperones cost them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Stephanie Welch again, president of Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| So we basically act as a fiscal agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| Mount Rest funds come through the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| So it's one of the funds within the East Tennessee Foundation that specifically focuses on environmental education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| and Lonsdale and some other schools have also tapped into this in the past, and so we've been the applicant on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Okay, we have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Seeing none, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| The next item is 39, it's resolution 501,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| approving an agreement with Breakthrough Corporation to provide $22,000 in 2018 Community Development Block Grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1585)|
| 0:26:34| CDBG program funds for the operation of a community and employment services program for autistic adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| federally funded through the HUD CDBG program funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Rebecca, community development basically has a third of this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| Items 39 to 59 are all, 58, excuse me, are all community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| Rather than have you go through each of these, I thought it would be a good idea just to pull one of them off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| and you give us a brief summation of all these items so that the public is aware of the things that we are doing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| This is the time of year that the annual plan is approved by HUD and we can move forward with a new fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| and HUD world is the program year, down further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| And so basically these are all the contracts linked to the CDBG program or the HOME program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| and a portion of the CDBG funds are broken up into two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| One is public service, and if you see some of the case manager type positions, those are for operating funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| But then you'll get to the other part of the CDBG funds, and those are actual housing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| You have Catholic Charities, which is emergency seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| You have CAC, which is single family homeowners that need rehab for their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| When you get to the HOME program, we work with the Community Housing Development Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| That's a requirement of the HUD program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| So that bulk of money, generally we have one that's certifiable within Knoxville and HomeSource East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| So pretty much 100 percent of those funds in the HOME program go to them for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| I gave you an overview of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| I gave you the fact sheet on this past year's performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| You can see there we gave a little overview of the public service, housing rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| But if you look at what I like to look at is who are the people we actually serve, what is the profile of those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| And I like to call it the least among us, because sometimes there's a misperception of people who access social safety nets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| And these are good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| And life just doesn't happen the same for some people as it happens for others, and they're good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| Our agencies that we work with, they get the financial records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| We have banking records through our agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| It has their W-2s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| It has their tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| It has, if they access our homeowner rehab program, they have to be current on their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| They're property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| So these are very good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| But if you look at the profile of the individuals, the average median income, and we call it AMI in the HUG world, is 63.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| If you look at our public service programs, which public service, we have Breakthrough Corporation, which is autistic adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| Helen Ross McNabb, they have an adult and child net mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| Knoxville Academy of Medicine has health care for the working poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| HomeSource East Tennessee provides a caregiver at their senior facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Public Defenders works on recidivism reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Senior Citizens Home Assistance has a caregiver training program to allow people to age in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| UTHMIS centrally houses all the data coming in from our social service agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| and houses the homeless information on behalf of Reports Back, the collective data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| We have VMC Bush Family Refuge, which provides vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| These vouchers actually help people stay in their homes by giving a voucher for electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| So these are things that are allowing people to stay in their homes who otherwise might have to move out of their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| We have the dental clinic, which is dental care for the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| Knoxville Area Urban League, we have a homeowner for financial and for foreclosure prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| And then we go on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Now, those are our public service areas, and those are pretty much for the staff that run these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| Then you go down to Catholic Charities and CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Catholic Charities is emergency housing for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| We're doing some rehab on that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| We have Autumn Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| They have a very big problem with some of the plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| It's very costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| It's like $10,000 a unit, and so it's very, very costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| So we're putting money in that because it's a lot of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| We have CAC, which is our single-family homeowner program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| Neighborhood Operation Backyard, minor home repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| a lot of these are wheelchair ramps to allow people to age in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| At the Sertoma Center, we deal with usually smaller rehab projects for them, up to four and five homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| We do smaller projects like for sealants, for waterproofing, repainting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| We've done bathroom rehab before on those because some of the populations in the Sertoma homes are aging there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| and so different needs are coming into play for the Sertoma homes as their populations age in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1853)|
| 0:31:02| So those are basically the CDBG program, public service and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| So if you look at the public service on the handout we gave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| 88% of the people that were served in the public service area are 0 to 30 AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| So if you look at that 63.9 and you do up to 30% of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| the bulk of the people that are served through these programs with the HUD funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| are truly the people that have the biggest struggles in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| The 31 to 50, you have about 7.34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So basically you're moving into the 95% range on individuals served in our public service programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| About 95% or 50% of AMI are under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| But if you go down to the housing rehab program, over 50% of those people are 0 to 30 AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| And then you move the next bracket up where you're going up to 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| You're talking basically in that bracket, you're talking about 85% of those individuals are 0 to 50 AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1910)|
| 0:31:58| So, and I gave a little overview at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| nine out of ten persons served in the public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| and four out of five served in the housing services for citizens with the greatest needs in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| The second sheet of your handout I gave you an overview of the HUD program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| that basically is a fact sheet that goes from 2005 to 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| And since then we've had 14 million, just over 14 million that have come to CDBG funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| We have over 5 million that's come to the home funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| And so that's a total of $19 million since 2005 that's come in our community to help individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| You go to the bottom half of that sheet, it tells households served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| It's over 2,300 households served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| And it's in the public service arena, you have 86,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| So if you add those two numbers together, you're coming up with 88,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| And keep in mind that households served, that's just if you count one person per household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| Many of those households have more than one person in those households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| So that number is in excess of 88,000 people that are served since 2005 on this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| And the last, I gave you some mapping here too, because in the HUD world it's very, very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| that we provide Knox County citizens options of where to live throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| We cannot segregate, nor should we segregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| So if you see mapping there, we have it broken out by the CDBG program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| In the side columns you'll see the agency was funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| the type of housing was provided, whether it's group homes, multifamily housing, how many units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| And the little stars will dictate in the CDBG program where the housing is at throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| But if you flip on over to the home program, it as well shows diversity in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| You can go far west, you can go up to the Coryton area and Mascot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| So we have diversity in our housing, which is exactly what we should be doing in our service with our HUD funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| I don't know if anybody has any more questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| That's basically just a general overview, but I will tell you coming into this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| and not knowing the details of it, it's an honor to be able to work on this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| because I tell our agencies that serve I could not do the front line work because it is heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| Some of the stories you hear is absolutely heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| And these are people that are good people that just have hard lives, and we need to have compassion on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| And so as part of the experience I've gained, it's given me a bigger heart for individuals that have tough lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| that are just good people, and they need and deserve these social safety nets to help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| to help their lives be as good as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| And I often think what fork in the road my life has been that could have been very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| and maybe I wouldn't be where I am today, and some of these people came to chronic health conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| or situations that dictated they are not basically people who are not trying hard in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| These are very, very good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| So I don't know if you have any questions specifically about any of the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| I apologize for the number, but that's what we have to do in the HUD regulatory part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| The legislative body locally has to vote on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Hey, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| My prior career, I spent a decade working with many of the agencies that were funding with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| I was a director of another nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| And when I first saw all these come through, I went to the federal site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| having applied for a lot of grants just to sort of get a feel for what they'd gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| the hoops they'd jumped through as we're working on these pass-through dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| It was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| One of the federal guidelines was that the grantees have to make sure that up to 70% of these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| must be spent on low or moderate income folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| And when we see the statistics that you've provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| we're exceeding that expectation of the feds pretty substantially, which is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| And also mainly just for the benefit of commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| one quick paragraph on what the feds determined as you're trying to do with this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| is that your focus is on low and moderate income folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| Benefit low and moderate income persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Prevent, of course, they're in my window, just got to prop up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| but prevention or elimination of slums or blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| Address community development needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Having a particular urgency because of existing conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| of which other funding is not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| So it seems like you've done a really good job stewarding these funds and these agencies to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| We have a great staff at community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| I will tell you they're quietly serving behind the scenes, and they just do a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| And I can't say enough about the people that serve in community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| They are very dedicated to their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| They work tirelessly at a lot of data, statistics, reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| and sometimes it's a little overwhelming in this world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| because of the requirements that are mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| And there's nothing wrong with those requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| because this is a, I think it's like a $39 billion federal program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| and they're trying to ensure that we have good housing nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| And so I have absolutely no problem with the regulations that go with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| The ultimate goal is to have good housing and good programs that serve people that really need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| And so I just want to say thank you to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| They've done an absolutely wonderful job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| and they are the people behind these budgets, behind these contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| Sheila Munzer back here, she's the one that puts all these on commission agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| so you can thank Sheila for the 20 or so items that are on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| But people work really hard behind the scenes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| and it's a very administrative type job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| and not a lot of glory to what they do every day in their jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| and in the reporting and going out and monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| So I just want to say thank you to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you, Rebecca, for you and your staff for the work you all do to help those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| that are least among us that are so deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| It's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| I just wanted to ask a quick question about Autumn's Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Why is the plumbing compromised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Is it because that development is not that age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| I think it's age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| When you get into some of these, it was public housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| and then they moved to call it a demonstration project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| The portfolio was so large on the national level of public housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| they allowed certain agencies, KCDC applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| and it was granted to move to a demonstration project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| and that allows them to route a different capital funds basically for rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| It's an aging issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Very large facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| It's a large facility, and basically it's a plumbing issue that's in these units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| and it's an age issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| And that's nationwide problematic for some of the public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Any further discussion amongst the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2316)|

| 0:38:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| The next item is number 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| It's resolution 602.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| It's approving a grant agreement in the amount of $231,560| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| with the Tennessee Department of Health for the provision of immunization services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| for the period beginning July 1st, 2018 and ending June 30th, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| No local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Commissioner Knox, your light came on for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Was that by accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| That was an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| Any commissioners have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| You can turn the light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| I just wanted an overview of the immunization program for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| That's what it is, and I knew Martha was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| Martha Buchanan, 140 Damard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| The immunization program is our program that helps track immunizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| for the zero to 24-month-olds as well as others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| but primarily that group of individuals who are being vaccinated in their infancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| to protect them from childhood illnesses such as chicken pox and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| It also is where we house our parent-adult B program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| So if a pregnant woman has hepatitis B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| we are notified of that so that we can vaccinate that child as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| so that we reduce the risk of that child getting hepatitis B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| So it really is our hub of vaccination information for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| and for parents and for providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2417)|
| 0:40:27| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| Seeing none, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Those opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Item number 61 is Resolution 603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| It's approving a grant contract in the amount of $156,900| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| with the Tennessee Department of Health for the provision of grant and aid funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| for the period beginning July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2459)|

| 0:41:02| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Seeing none, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Item 62, Resolution 701,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| is authorizing the acceptance of two Park Bench donations for Clayton Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| and one for Admiral Farragut Park in the amount of $1,500 each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| for a total of $4,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Yes, is there anybody here from Parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| I just noticed in the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| I was curious whether these were businesses that purchased the seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| or they were individuals or families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| Oh, I'm sorry, Mike's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Hiding in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| If you would, sir, give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2517)|
| 0:42:06| Mike Danilla, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| That's pretty much where I live lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| Commissioner, I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| I'm going to assume with Clayton that it's one of our nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2537)|
| 0:42:28| one of our local community groups, but I can check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| I was just curious, are these memorials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| I don't believe they are memorial benches because under that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| the folks that get those actually pay for them through a third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| and then we kind of help facilitate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| I was just curious mainly for the Admiral Farragut Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| I'll find out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Stay right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Any further discussion amongst the commissioners or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| Seeing none, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Item number 63, resolution 702, is approving a contract in an amount not to exceed $97,763| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2595)|
| 0:43:24| with the Knoxville Football Officials Association for providing officials to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| Knox County Parks and Recreation Department's Youth Football League for the 2018 season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Mike, does this pass through money, and do the community of the leagues raise the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| and then turn over for us to pay for these, or do we pay for the officials ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| I know that we pay, if I'm not mistaken, it's $25 a game for the officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| I want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| It's through the entry fees from the league, so each team pays an entry fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| and the entry fee pays for security and officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| So it's more or less passed through to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| That's all I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Since I've got Mike up in front of us, I've got a chance to grill him a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| No, I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| On these officiating, do we have somebody we pick that from, or is there a group that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| How do we get these officiating people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| As I understand it, there's a non-profit, well, I don't know if it's a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2670)|
| 0:44:37| I think it's a non-profit organization that they go through and hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| Because you remember when there was that issue with the officials last time, the official and the coach that made the news?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2680)|
| 0:44:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| They got suspended through this one organization, and so that's my understanding of how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2690)|
| 0:45:01| They go through them, and then they go through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| And the reason...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| I'm telling you the origins of how I found this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| I'm not sure if I know the answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| The only reason why I was asking this, we get a lot of publicity from these individuals that we hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| that teams from out of town or out of the state comes in here and participates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| And if we have that incident happen again, what we're trying to promote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| hopefully through some of the studies we've done, is youth sports in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| I just wondered how we choose those so we don't run into instances like that in any of the leagues that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| I mean, they apply, and we also do background checks on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| I'm just saying it's, you know, that was something last year that I, you know, was kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| We're getting a little off item here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| But anyway, I just wanted to know how that was done and since we're paying that amount and how they're being chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Speaking of hiring, I mean, on the Knox County website, you can apply to be, to ref and up games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2758)|
| 0:46:07| So we offer that through our Knox County website on knoxcounty.org as a job to apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| I'm on the Parks and Rec Board, and this was one of our discussions at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| You know, actually, we did not have enough officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| and we're having to reschedule games at different times just because there are not enough officials to cover all the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| So anybody that wants to help us to recruit more people would be appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| because these officials, it's not as much fun as it looks sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| You've been to a Little League game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| These are the youth games, and sometimes those are the most brutal for the officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| I would echo that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| In addition, we have a hard time sometimes finding people that can actually keep score, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| I don't say it jokingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| I think we pay like $10 or $15 a game for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Seeing that we have a proper motion and a second before us, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| The next item is number 65, resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| This is a proven participating addendum with Sid Tool Company doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| as MSC, Industrial Supply Company, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2850)|

| 0:47:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| They pulled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| Mr. Chairman, I don't know if it was me, but I'll ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Where is Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2882)|
| 0:48:14| Did you say it first or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| Matt, this is U.S. commodities or U.S. communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| I don't know if we do much business through that purchasing organization or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| How is this NASPO, is that like U.S. communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| It's another cooperative agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| You know, a group has gotten together and created that entity, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| And for that information is that U.S. communities and these groups like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| they go out and they find the best bids, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| And they all go into these agreements and we can add on to these agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| And that's what's before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| You've seen a few others recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| You might see a few more in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| I don't believe before that those were necessarily brought to you all for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| But I do want to bring these to you so you know that we've entered into this agreement with this cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Seeing none, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Item number 68, Resolution 804, is designating or committing and appropriating funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| a total amount of $400,000 from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019 for various departmental expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| related to the transition of elected official offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| Apologize, I believe that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| I just would like to know what, since this is my first step of seeing this transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| if Mr. Caldwell will tell us what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Just for information purposes, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| Every four or eight years, this is a bigger one because we have five main offices changing hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| And so we'll always set money aside from surplus, one-time money for one-time expenses to account for things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3018)|
| 0:50:29| in the first case, the audit committee approved today, closeout audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| And so that will go to pay for closeout audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| We don't know exactly what those will cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| It depends on what they find or get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Also, what you have is you normally have transition team or teams in offices like the mayor or sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| and maybe even some of the other offices to where they're allowed to bring an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| or individuals leading up after the election until they take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| And so some of that is for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| What you have a lot of is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| It will be turnover in the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| And I'll just use sheriff's office or the mayor's office as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| If you have three chiefs in the sheriff's office who are going to retire who's been there 30-some years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| who's higher up and they have the max amount of annual and sick leave, that could cost you about $35,000 a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| So that gets eaten up in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| And so it's mainly for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Now, the number that is before you is the number that we estimated in finance, just for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| So mainly the closeout audits, transition teams, the payouts of people who may retire or may not be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3101)|
| 0:51:50| Then also you're going to have the cost of stationary, changing all that out, which is letterhead and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| You may have some office renovations, office furniture, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| So that's just what it accounts for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| And we prefer to do it as a designation than do it in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| which just blows up the budget for one year, then you take it right back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| Any further discussion amongst commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| The next item is number 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| It's resolution 809, and I'll be reading a revised caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| It's approving an administrative services agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| for the administration of employee medical insurance benefits under the Knox County Government Health Care Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| Just to confirm that we're moving from Humana to Blue Cross, is that right, Mr. Jones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| Mark Jones, 400 Main Street, room 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| I just wanted to verify that, but to let everybody know that we will be moving from Humana to Blue Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3187)|
| 0:53:17| Commissioner Gil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| Why are we making the switch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| We've got much better terms with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| It also has to go out every so often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| The contract expires at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| So it was bid and competed, and Blue Cross Blue Shield was the winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| We also have Kenny Davis and Todd Hodge are with Blue Cross Blue Shield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| are here with us today if you have any questions specifically for the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| Commissioner Gil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I mean, I'm sorry, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| I do serve on the insurance committee for benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| and although I'm a non-voting member and I do not have Knox County insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| but I will say that this committee of someone from every single department of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| takes this committee very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| Sandy Sexton serves also on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| This committee probably works harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| I would put it up to working as hard as any committee or board with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| We also have, I'm going to embarrass her, but Kristen out there in benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| And, I mean, if you want to know anything, she's the one to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| And I believe we had about a five-hour meeting, two meetings ago, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3282)|
| 0:54:50| We had to move three rooms because everybody was running us out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| and we ended up in a sheriff's conference room down in the basement and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| But anyway, I would say this was not a change that was made lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| Every person that sits on that committee went back to their employees and discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| made sure that they were making the right move for their employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| as well as for Knox County, all the employees on it, and the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| Blue Cross Blue Shield, if you look at the map of the United States and everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3320)|
| 0:55:27| I mean, they're just lit up everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| So if any employee is out of town or whatever and something happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| Blue Cross had it filled a whole lot more than Humana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| But as Mark said, Blue Cross Blue Shield is offering us more in terms of also a lot of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| for us to be able to track some things that we have not been able to track for the years to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| to help this committee be able to make sure that we're providing the best insurance to Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| while at the same time helping save taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| I just can't say enough about that insurance committee to be able to be a part on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| It's a great committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| We're really working for the best interest of Knox County and the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| It's a fabulous committee meeting, and if you've never been to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| I invite you to come because it is a very working committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| and they do very well working with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, because I was at the last insurance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| I'd like to ask some questions about Blue Cross Blue Shield's provider network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| and if they could just be answered to talk about what that plan administration looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| Would you like for Mr. Davis to come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3409)|
| 0:56:59| Hi, Kenny Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I'd love to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Are there specific providers you're in question about or just in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Just in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Yes, so we have the broadest national network, as Commissioner Carringer was commenting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| through the process with the county through the consultant also evaluated the network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| and looked at the providers that we had both locally across the state and across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| But locally, we have all the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| We have the vast majority of doctors that are in network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| I think if you compare, I didn't see the final result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| but we have the largest network in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| and we feel that carries over into East Tennessee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3450)|
| 0:57:45| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I know Humana had a wellness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| You had to go to your doctor and get your wellness form filled out before so you could get to better rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| Is Blue Cross going to do this or is this going away, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| I'll tell you where we are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| You're talking about the Go365, the wellness plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| We're still in discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Humana does offer that as a separate plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| and that is actually before the committee for a decision in August, in the August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| Is that the one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| I know last year there was a couple associates that didn't go to the doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| the doctor filled out the wellness form, so they were charged a higher rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| Instead of 220, they were charged 320.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| I don't think that's part of the Go365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| My question is, I've already done mine, my wife and I have already done ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| but is Blue Cross going to require that so we can have a cheaper rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| if the associate can have a cheaper rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| If we continue with the Go365 product, then it would be exactly the same way it's operated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| and Blue Cross Blue Shield has been willing to work with us on the way it would be set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| Sometimes that's very confusing, and I want to make sure between now and November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| that associates know that they need to do this for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| One of the great things about Krista, she's coming down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| is her communication skills and where she communicates with the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| I'm going to let her address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Krista Baig, I actually do live in this building, for real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| Kris just asked me to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| We're actually a self-funded health insurance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| so those requirements actually are set up by the health insurance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| It was not a requirement from Humana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| It was an internal requirement in order for the committee to try to help motivate employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| to take initiative and be engaged in their own health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| They did initially raise that rate, and then they decided to kind of ease back on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| We're now kind of at a middle ground rate for those non-preferred rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| but that is actually set internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Members of the committee vote on what that will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| and it's all related to how much control we have over the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| One of the things that Mark has not mentioned is kind of the financials behind why we're making this move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| and this change, so just to go over that very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| The Blue Cross Blue Shield contract is about $1.1 million superior to our current medical contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| We've also been working very hard with our pharmacy contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| and have negotiated a contract that over the course of two years will be about $1.8 million superior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| So what we're looking at is over the next two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| an approximate savings of about $4 million over just those two products that we have for insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3644)|
| 1:00:52| Now, that being said, the cost of health care goes up every single year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| and we never know when a specialty drug is going to happen that someone legitimately needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| We work very hard as a department to prevent use that is maybe not clinically indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| and to be good stewards of that money, but as far as what we've renegotiated with contracting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| we're looking at those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| Now, that being said, the spend can be a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Well, a question and a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| Do we know generally enough, I mean, are our rates for our employees going up at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| Are they going to stay the same this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| So as part of self-funding our health insurance plan, that committee does make the decision on rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| At the last insurance committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| we actually brought to the committee members different options for changing the rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| and at the next committee meeting they're going to make a vote on those rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| What we have proposed out of our department is either raising the rates equal to what was raised last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3711)|
| 1:01:58| or to a lesser value, and we've given them kind of four different models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| but the committee members are welcome to come to us and ask for other models that they can vote on and decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| And what the city does with the clinic that we have, you have to have a yearly wellness check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3728)|
| 1:02:16| I think that would save, and I've tried to get people to invest or investigate doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| You can actually piggyback, I believe, by code off that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| And what they've done is started fighting the high-cost diabetes, heart hypertension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| and those things that cause a lot of our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| And it's actually the first year they did it, they actually saved a substantial amount of money, medically speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| Why would the county not have something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| So I think that there's interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| We did take members of the health insurance committee out to the clinic, the center for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| and let them tour the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| I think right now we're having a lot of change in our department, as you've seen, kind of the other contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| and so we've been working really hard on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| But I think there is interest, and we have been looking at that as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| I mean, the one thing it's cut down on that people don't realize is a guy can come from service departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| and those guys can tend to go to the ER for a visit, a well visit, and they'll go to the clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3796)|
| 1:03:24| and we can walk out of there with $5 with our drugs walking out the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| almost go back to work that day or the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| So it saves a lot of time and money, and I think the county should investigate doing that pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| Because if you're saving $4 million next year, it's hard to tell the employees that you're going to raise their rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| And you're not doing anything else to prevent costs from going up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| We have evaluated that in the past, not in the last couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| but we've actually did two RFPs to look at evaluating what an on-site clinic and how it would work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3828)|
| 1:03:56| At that time, it just didn't really come out to where we thought we could break even on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| But I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| It's not a break-even initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| It's a slow-down-the-cost initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| So, I mean, you can't quantify how much money you're going to save if you don't try to save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| And it was evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| And I think it's something we need to continue to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| As Krista said, we're real impressed with what the city has done with that clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| We went over there a couple months ago and toured that clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| So I think it's something we need to continue to look at for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| I hope you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Commissioner Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| What has been our total expenditures for FY18 for medical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| For medical only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| I don't know that I have medical only, and I don't get my reports by fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| So, Chris, do you have that committed to memory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Well, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| What I can give you is reporting based on the plan year, which is what we receive as a department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| Basically, we run it by the plan year because that is when people's accumulators run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| So your deductibles, your coinsurance, everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| So what does it cost us from the first six months of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3913)|
| 1:05:22| Just guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| For the first six months of this year, if we're talking only on the medical side after the bills have been paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3924)|
| 1:05:32| we are looking at probably approximately $12 million, but that's including kind of everything in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3932)|
| 1:05:40| our pharmacy, the fees that it takes to pay the bills, and our stop loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| Krista doesn't guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| I try not to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| I try to give a more accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| I can tell you what the pharmacy and the medical is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| Approximately for the year, for 17, for the budget year 17, it was about $26,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Which was down from two years prior to that, which was about $29,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| What do you think 18 is going to come in at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| You never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| We're hoping to be along the same lines as last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| It's kind of hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Just to reemphasize, I guess we formed this insurance committee, was it 2008 or 2009?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3986)|
| 1:06:36| I was at the beginning of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| We were looking at having our own clinic that Brad was asking about then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| We went several places, had several people come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| I assure everybody in here that Knox County and this insurance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| has been looking at that for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| and there's a lot of different things that come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| when we're talking about all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| We toured some clinics down in Chattanooga and down in Wilson County also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| and down in Brentwood, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| I assure you, if there's a way that we could figure out and bring it together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| where it would work and really make sense for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| the entire insurance committee would be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| To also answer a question, and you all can correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| but I believe if we had stayed with Humana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| was it Humana taking all the summit doctors off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| Because we looked at several different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| and I know that was one thing I was concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| because just from being a woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| I raised the question about the women's pavilion at St. Mary's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| or the old St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| I'm from the old school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| Some of the OB-GYN doctors were summit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| and I had a big concern about that because of all the younger women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| who are Knox County employees about having their OB-GYNs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| I thought that was Humana that was pulling summit doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| I think it's actually Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Yeah, they were pulling Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| which included the summit doctors that were in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| because the women's pavilion over there is considered Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| It's a Tenova facility, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| I believe that that was with the narrower network that they proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| and my understanding is that in order to get the same savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| that we would have achieved with moving everyone to Blue Cross Blue Shield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| keeping everyone's access and coverage relatively the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| if we were to stay with Humana| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| and wanted to get the same financial deal that we're getting with Blue Cross Blue Shield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| we would have to have a section of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| somewhere 35% to 40% of employees move to what's called a skinny network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| where you have significantly less access to some of the doctors and providers in our facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| including no access to Tenova hospitals and including their outpatient centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| So I think that's what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Yes, because that included a portion of Tenova's women's care over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| were under the summit doctors at Tenova, so that would have kicked them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| And so that was another, I mean, that was a big concern for mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| because there's still a lot of people that use the Tenova facilities, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| So, yeah, you know, hey, insurance is insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| and, you know, people, it's hard to be without it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| and it's going to change, and it changes every day, as everybody knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| with the medicine and all that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| And we never know one big catastrophic event in somebody's life can change the whole table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4194)|
| 1:10:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| So it is about carrying the risk, and we did discuss at the last meeting that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| we have had claims of the sum of $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| and so what can look like a year that's trending fairly flat, we have to be prepared for that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Thank you, Ms. Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| You don't have to get it right now, but you were talking about a clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Can you tell me what, later on, maybe next week or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| what the physical note would be to start up a clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| and how that would compare to the savings we've got with that EF, the savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| you know, that kind of comparison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| If you could do that, that would help us quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| I'd appreciate it, and you don't have to answer that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Mark, Krista, Bryant, and Samantha are our benefits team here at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| and if you look at our spend, our savings, and our rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| you will find that they're doing such a good job that we are outperforming most of the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| These people work really hard, they're really smart, and they're really thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4269)|
| 1:11:16| Okay, we have a motion before us and a proper motion in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Item number 74, resolution 901,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| it's amending the Knox County Commission rules to provide for one automatic deferral of rezoning requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| and setting the annual reorganization meeting of the commission to be September 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| or the next business day thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| I pulled it off earlier, but my computer didn't bring down any attachments to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| and I didn't see it, so I don't need to pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| The only goal is no recommendations, so we can discuss it Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| I'll make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Is there a reason you want to delay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Yeah, Commissioner Andrews just said there's no attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| I found them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| He found them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| I looked at them earlier in the week and didn't have them on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Well, I did too, and I didn't see them on there either, so I didn't check today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| So I'll remove my motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| So we're back to the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| No further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| Item 75, Resolution 902, is authorizing the Knox County Clerk of the Criminal Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| and General Sessions Court Criminal Division to charge and collect an electronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| traffic citation fee of $5 pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated Subsection 55-10-270E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4380)|
| 1:13:13| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| Commissioner Daly, you pulled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| I'm glad I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Thank you, Mr. Hammond, for bringing this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| and hopefully we can collect these $5 fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| I had sent you a memo explaining the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| It's a $5 user fee for those who get traffic citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| $1 will go to the clerk as a handling fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| $4 will go to the appropriate agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| So, for example, if it's highway patrol, they would get $4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| If it's Knox County Sheriff, they would get $4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| We anticipate 30,000 traffic citations a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| That's just an estimate, so that would be about $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| That's earmarked specifically for the infrastructure for e-citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| Now, the highway patrol is already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| I can tell you the efficiency has just improved dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| I've talked with Sheriff Alex Spangler and Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| They're both, of course, in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| But the money is specific for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| It has to be an e-cite, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| It can't be a handwritten ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| It's only for traffic citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Seatbelts would not be involved, for example, but 95% of the traffic citations written would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| But written or e-cite?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| E-cite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| It has to be an e-cite ticket to get the $5 charge, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4472)|

| 1:15:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4500)|

| 1:15:13| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| Item number 77, Resolution 904 is requesting the Knox County Engineering and Public Works Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| to install a sign in front of the Powell High School on Old Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| to recognize the home of the 2018 State Girls Softball Champions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| Mr. Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| I'd like to move this to the August agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| You want to defer it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| And we have a motion to defer for 30 days and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| Okay, the next item was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| It will be a resolution, and I'm not sure if I have the correct language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| but a resolution for Knox County Senior Center, Memorandum of Understanding with the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4561)|
| 1:16:09| If that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Is it a Memorandum of Understanding or is it a Memorandum of Lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| It's a Memorandum of Understanding and a Lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| It's two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| And I'll make a motion to move with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Yeah, briefly reading the lease, I didn't get it obviously until today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| but I'd like to see a provision inside the lease somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| I know that's still up for negotiation about early voting and elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| because the lease in the front couple of pages talks about the time it could be used and the time it could be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| and the open hours for the community center on the Farragut side of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| if early voting occurred in there, it would be outside that lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| And so I'd like to see a place where we could, outside the hours in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| Well, what we've done in the past was use the town center for early voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| because that's kind of the central point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| Right, but the lease states that we could only use the shared space up until 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| Right, because that's currently the way the staffing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| I just want to make sure that we can use that facility and be inside the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| I mean, it just needs to be worded in there that early election day and early voting could be in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| in the shared space if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| I just want to make sure that we can do that because inside that lease we couldn't be able to do those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| Right, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| But I think the election commission at this point still wants to use the town hall just because of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| They won't next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| They won't whenever this facility is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| Okay, we have a motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| No, a motion to pass with no recommendation until Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| In a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| Item number 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| It's ordinance 0-18-7-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| It's amending Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 9, entitled Procurement Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| to provide for various changes to the procurement code of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| This amends ordinance 0-08-5-101, adopted June 23, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| 0-10-11-101, adopted December 17, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| 0-11-5-103, adopted June 27, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| Ordinance 0-13-10-101, adopted November 18, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| And ordinance 0-16-3-101, adopted April 25, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| You and I had a phone conversation about this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| Would you go, I don't know if any other commissioners called you or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| will you explain what is going on, what is changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| Then I'll voice my concerns on what I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| Commissioners, I also sent a memo out for you all to read and understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| And just real briefly, changing the current dollar thresholds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| Right now we're up to $10,000 is what we consider a small procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| $10,000 to $25,000, and it's obviously $24,999, but we're using round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| That's an informal bidding situation which requires quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| Over $25,000 is a sealed solicitation, competitive solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| That's our current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| What I'm proposing to do is move these up to $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| and it's aligning with the state of Tennessee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| Shelby County is using this model, ETSU, University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| Up to $25,000 would be considered a small procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| $25,000 to $50,000 would require three written quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| The key word here is written quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| And anything over $50,000 would be a competitive solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| Just moving with what the state is currently doing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| Being a charter form of government allows us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| Those other agencies or counties that are under one of the two acts that are mentioned in TCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4827)|
| 1:20:34| they still have to follow those procurement acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| So that's in a nutshell of the main part about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| There is some clarification regarding aggregate spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| Aggregate has never been included in here, so now it's aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| In other words, when I get to certain dollar levels, that's it with that vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| unless we have a competitive solicitation or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| So we're adding aggregate spend in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| It's kind of a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| Jake, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| My first question is, well, prior to that, I came from a $3 billion company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| and even at $3 billion, we never had a policy like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| And that kind of concerns me that we're at one point with debt and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| we're $1.4 or $1.5 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| My concern is that I'm not saying anything is going wrong now or bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| but, you know, when we raise the threshold from $10,000 to $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| we could look further into the buddy system or the brother-in-laws or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| and that kind of concerns me that we may not catch that until we already spent $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| And I'm looking at the tax dollars that I represent the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| So that's the part that, you know, you and I discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| that's the part that I'm concerned, that concerns me most of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| Let's say a department, we raised this right now, it's $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| Let's say a department buys from an individual or a company, not an individual but a company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4935)|
| 1:22:23| does that company have to be already registered as a vendor for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| or can they go outside the vendor registration and buy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| Well, in order for me to issue a purchase order to a company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| they have to register through our procurement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| I can't issue a purchase order any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| So, yes, they would have to be a registered vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| Have we in the past ever had any type of problems that really would stick out to you that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| I know increasing the, from $10,000 to $15,000 to that $25,000 level, to me that's, that is a huge increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4973)|
| 1:23:06| And I just don't want to know, or hopefully we won't see that if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| that in five years, 10 years, 15 years, that we're on the front of the news because of something that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| That's my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| It's not, I really appreciate the process and you're doing a great job in procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| I'm just, maybe I'm looking at the black cloud and not the lining around the cloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| Keep in mind, and I don't think there's anybody here from the sheriff's office or the schools, we're a gatekeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| I don't want to be a policeman, but sometimes I have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| There are many times where we send something back that says we can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| We're now in a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| You've got to have three quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Or when we get to that $25,000, you've got to do a bid or find another vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| We tell departments all the time that we're over with this vendor for this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5033)|
| 1:24:01| How much more work, I'm sorry, less work will this create?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5041)|
| 1:24:09| Kevin, do you have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Will it lessen your workload or about the same as your guests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| Well, as I put in my memo, you know, we have eight professional buying staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| And I want to tell you, you know, I got to hear Rebecca talk about her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| I want to talk about mine now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| They do an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| Keep in mind, we buy for every agency and department and division of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| It's KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| It's MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| It's the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| It's the sheriff's office at school, CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| We buy for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| So, quite frankly, there is a lot on all of our plates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| Several of you all have had the pleasure, and I hope it was a pleasure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| to sit through, you know, some procurements that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| They're not always easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| They're not always quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Some of them can take months to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| So, you know, moving these would help alleviate some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| I would like to say before I move further, you all may not know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| a little known fact about our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| We're one of only 147 agencies across the entire nation to achieve one of NIGPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5112)|
| 1:25:19| It's their second highest award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| NIGP is our national association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| We're one of 147 agencies across the nation to achieve that award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| So, very proud of the staff and the hard work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| We've had issues with mowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| I'm not afraid to fire somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| If you're not doing the job, we're going to fire you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| and we'll go to the next bidder or redo the solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| So I think a short answer to your question now would be it would help my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| It would help us focus on the more complex ones that some of you all have been through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| spend more time with that, being able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| schedule meetings with those that we need to, negotiate better instead of being rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| I just think, you know, with the close to $900 million, we're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| We really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| In your aggregate spending, say, for instance, you buy a large item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| say it's $29,500 and whatever, and it's, say, a vehicle of some sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5178)|
| 1:26:26| and then, say, a couple of months later you need to buy another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| would that be what you're talking about, stacking your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| We would have to do a competitive solicitation because I've already spent my limit with that company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| So when you get to that threshold, then you've got to put it out for bid for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| So basically, that's how everything works in there now if we go to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| Doesn't mean they wouldn't win the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| They could win the bid, come in with the lowest, best value product, whatever we're, you know, putting out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| They may win that, but would I have to do a competitive solicitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Mr. Myers, are there that many less than $10,000 purchase orders issued from your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5228)|
| 1:27:17| There were 297, I believe, is the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| I was going to look for the spreadsheet that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| There were 297 that were between the $10,000 and the $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5242)|
| 1:27:29| Oh, okay, between that cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| Under the $10,000, there was quite a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| And then the other thing, one of the things I thought was great is that you want to change the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| so that as a commissioner, when we see an item that's, say, a $35,000 expenditure for the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5263)|
| 1:27:53| we think that's only $35,000 for this year, but it might be a five-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| So you'll list it now as the life of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| Which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Proposing anticipated life of the contract, which has not been in there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| Which helps us give us the accurate information of actually what this contract, the value is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| Most of the contracts, a lot of the schools, the trade ones, they're up to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| If it was $25,000 or $35,000, as you mentioned, it wouldn't necessarily require your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| I think it kind of piggybacks on what Vice Chair Fusler said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| A specific vendor adds an aggregate that they can get in work before they have to bid everything, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5315)|
| 1:28:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| What happens if you have an item or something that you wish to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| that if they bid on that, that will put them over that limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| but there are other people that could, registered vendors that could bid without going over that limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5335)|
| 1:29:02| Since we've never used aggregate before for a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Well, you know, the goal is to, and it could be, and I don't want to pick on the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| but if they buy an item and it's just under that limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| if the school system or I or any other department wants to buy the next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| then I've got to bid that out because the aggregate per vendor per fiscal year, it would push that over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| But what if you had another vendor that also supplies that has not reached their aggregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| and it would not push them over the aggregate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| They could use the other vendor if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| But if not, they would have to use the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| If they ask me to bid that out, I will bid it out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| One thing I was going to say in reference to what Commissioner Daley was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| as this goes back to the Audit Committee today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| our external auditors have recommended for a couple of years now for us to increase our limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| I think they're too low and I think this falls in line with what they were recommending for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| Commissioner Nassar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| Yeah, one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Once again, I don't want to get too much in the weeds on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| because we were just talking about aggregate spending per vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| But this is probably going to be per product because I would anticipate we are going to have different services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| different products, different widgets, or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| where you could have the same vendor could have multiple contracts for different types of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| I mean, is that stuff going to be addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| Because I'm sure we could have a vendor that has a contract for one type of item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| because that could need some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| If you could elaborate on that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Well, if you look at some of the vendors today, you know, they have a book that says that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| well, if I'm only buying this but they have others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| I'm still looking at aggregate spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| Then I'm asking someone to, you know, start cherry picking items to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| If we're spending that amount of money with that vendor, then I just need to get them under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5461)|
| 1:31:09| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| I think the clarification for you is, I mean, like on Office Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| where they have a yearly contract with them, this is just if somebody has an idea and wants to buy something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| and if that aggregate has not been met, then they can buy that at $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| But Office Depot or a pilot or whoever we're doing all that vending with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| I mean, they've already got contracts anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| We manage close to 400 contracts, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| Somebody always seems to find something that's not on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| My comment is sort of off the cuff in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| I appreciate Mr. Myers bringing this suggestion to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| As I've sort of sat back and listened to what's taking place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| I remember in the dead of night, that's one o'clock in the morning maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5515)|
| 1:32:04| when I was seated a lot further down the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| listening to the contentious discussions between the administration of the county then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5529)|
| 1:32:19| and some of my fellow commission members at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| the system we've been operating under was somewhat political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| And the rules were I've got you rules or I'm going to make you rules or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5549)|
| 1:32:37| And the process that's been brought to us this evening for us to consider is very unpolitical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5557)|
| 1:32:47| It's based on best value for Knox County and our constituents as citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| And I appreciate it being brought forward and I look forward to us being able to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| With that, is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| We have a motion before us to pass without recommendation to Monday's meeting and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5584)|

| 1:37:25| Well, that's Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| That could be city council, but it shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Well, how about we do it in the small assembly room, too, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| How about we look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| Let's do it in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| We can do it in the conference room for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| CTV can't run two things simultaneously, and that is a public meeting that would need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5866)|

| 1:37:55| Well, let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| Drew, will you check on that Tuesday and bring us back available times on that Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5878)|
| 1:38:05| and then we will figure out on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| So we'll come back to this discussion on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| Just one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| Can somebody check to make sure we have to be on CCTV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| Because, I mean, city council, they go into the small assembly room and reorganize, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| There are cameras there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| But are we required under our rules for our reorganization to be on television?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5910)|
| 1:38:37| On their calendar, they're not scheduled until the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| They're not scheduled until the 6th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5920)|

| 1:38:54| We outrank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5934)|

| 1:39:22| Mr. Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Yes, sir, Mr. Commissioner, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| I'd like to move that with no recommendation to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| I don't think we have to have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| And since we've got 85 there, too, can we move that also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| Can I make a comment on 85?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| I don't know how the conversation is going to go, but I really feel uneasy about talking about soft targets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5983)|
| 1:39:50| and any kind of emergency preparation in a commission-type public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| because there's conversations that need to be had in private with those that provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| This is not to discuss specifics or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| This is to get us in a mode to take a look at some training that we might look at down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6005)|
| 1:40:14| It's not specifically to say this is a soft target, this is a soft target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| How can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| I'm not familiar that much with the protocol of what we'll be facing for some of these activities that may go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6021)|
| 1:40:30| That's why I'd like to have that conversation in private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| It's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| It's a planning issue that doesn't need to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| it just doesn't need to be a public conversation on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| It's being done to the agencies that do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| We do exercises all the time, EOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| It's already being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| If you have questions, ask the guys that do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| I just really feel uncomfortable having a conversation about it in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| and I hope the other commissioners feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| Is there anything else before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6066)|

| 1:41:31| Which one of these zoning issues is not being heard this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| It should be marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180716?start=6096)|
