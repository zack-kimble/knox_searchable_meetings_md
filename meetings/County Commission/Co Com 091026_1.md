| 2:41:42| the ordinance ain't worth a nickel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9702)|

| 2:42:22| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| Eight O's in the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9746)|

| 2:42:29| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9749)|
| 2:42:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| There have been questions in my mind about the open meetings or the sunshine as we refer to it frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9752)|
| 2:42:40| The things that I have questioned along the way have been some reported in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9760)|
| 2:42:49| other media outlets asking the same questions, I guess, that I've asked along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9769)|
| 2:42:57| Basically, I'm only asking it for us to discuss what occurred as my first official act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9777)|
| 2:43:06| was to receive the decree saying we existed under sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9786)|
| 2:43:12| I hadn't more than sat down and here's the paper saying there's a difference between discussion and deliberation, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9792)|
| 2:43:21| As we have moved along, one of my questions revolves around was that a 12-month decree or has it expired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9801)|
| 2:43:34| Were we at that time held to a higher standard than other organizations in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9814)|
| 2:43:41| And I think we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| Things have changed maybe, and I just want to maybe get my fears allayed that we are dealing in a different day and age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9824)|
| 2:43:53| when it comes to sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| Some of the things that happened, for example, this Thursday coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9836)|
| 2:44:01| it could be possible that I might go to the Inner City Republican Club meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9841)|
| 2:44:06| and not know whether other Republican commissioners might be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| If I don't know in advance who may attend, how do I get that meeting noticed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9850)|
| 2:44:15| So really, should that meeting be noticed anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9855)|
| 2:44:19| I know that I probably won't attend that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| I'll probably go to the Sheriff's Citizens Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| which is an ongoing weekly process of information sharing of the sheriff to citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9865)|
| 2:44:39| which occasionally there's two or three commissioners there because we were invited to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9879)|
| 2:44:44| Yet I don't think those meetings are noticed because I don't know if we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9884)|
| 2:44:49| I don't see anything on the agenda for their training that night saying we are going to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9889)|
| 2:44:55| or even deliberate Knox County policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| So as I've brought this up two or three or four months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9899)|
| 2:45:04| I feel better today about my understanding of the sunshine law, of where we may be today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9904)|
| 2:45:14| and if there are other commissioners that would like to say yes or no about where we think we are or where we stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9914)|
| 2:45:22| or if the law director would like to comment on anything that I said, I'd feel free to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9922)|
| 2:45:32| I notice that I put him to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9932)|
| 2:45:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| Thank you, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| I just think some of the basics, I mean, regardless of what local decrees we have from local judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9939)|
| 2:45:44| you still have a state open government law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| That essentially reads that a governing body, of course, I don't need to define that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9947)|
| 2:45:53| but this is how state law defines a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| It's the convening of a governing body, of a public body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| for which a quorum is required in order to make a decision or to deliberate towards a decision on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9959)|
| 2:46:06| A meeting does not include any on-site inspection of any project or program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9966)|
| 2:46:11| and meetings likewise, as interpreted by the courts, do not mean chance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| So if you show up at a function and there are other commissioners there, you need not run in terror from one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9975)|
| 2:46:21| What you don't want to do is start getting into conversations on issues that you're ultimately going to make a definitive decision on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9981)|
| 2:46:27| during a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| Now, the term deliberate has always been vexing, and the reason it's vexing is because the statutes use it and don't define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9989)|
| 2:46:35| So when the legislature put the term in there, they neglected to put a definition for the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=9995)|
| 2:46:40| So the Tennessee Supreme Court noted this specifically, and they said we're advising commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10000)|
| 2:46:46| or we're admonishing them not to deliberate and we're not defining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| So what basically the Supreme Court of Tennessee said was, well, we're going to defer to Black's Law Dictionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10009)|
| 2:46:57| and Black's Law Dictionary defines deliberation as the act of weighing and examining the reasons for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| and against a contemplated act or course of conduct or a choice of acts or means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10022)|
| 2:47:08| Again, not a lot of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| Bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10030)|
| 2:47:11| You're in a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| If there's two or more gathered and you're going to get into an issue where you're going to start discussing things that's basically county business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10033)|
| 2:47:19| danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| Be careful. Avoid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| Talk about sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10042)|
| 2:47:23| Talk about the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| You can even say something as innocuous as we've got a tough meeting coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| And once you start saying, and by the way, in item number three, I think we should do X, Y, and Z, you're deliberating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10047)|
| 2:47:32| So a lot of it, unfortunately, I say it's commonsensical because although we have a statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10052)|
| 2:47:37| it doesn't clearly define how far you can roam when you're doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10057)|
| 2:47:42| Bottom line is if you can have a meeting of two or more and you're going to deliberate, notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| Keep minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| Make sure the minutes are available for public inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10066)|
| 2:47:54| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10074)|
| 2:47:55| I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10075)|
| 2:47:56| From time to time I will go to a lot of community meetings and several of us will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10076)|
| 2:48:01| and I'll say here's what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| I don't give my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| I just say what's coming up that I think is of interest to that part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10085)|
| 2:48:10| Is there a problem with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10090)|
| 2:48:11| No, sir, because, in fact, I recall having spoken at the halls of business professional organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| You were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| Two other commissioners were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| You essentially said this is what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| You sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| There was no debate between you and the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| It wasn't debated amongst a crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| You didn't field questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| That's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10106)|
| 2:48:27| But if you had stood up there and started engaging in banter with another commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| or started getting more in-depth analysis, then you're starting to get into a dangerous area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10111)|
| 2:48:36| Well, let me ask you one question to take it one step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| What if I wanted something, say guns in the park, and I said how do you all feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| And I'm not deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| I just want to see how they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| What if I said show me a show of hands, who's for it and who's against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10126)|
| 2:48:49| Is there a problem with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| Well, if you're canvassing just non-members of the body politic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10136)|
| 2:48:57| But if you start including, if you start looking to your colleagues and say, well, while we're on the subject, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10137)|
| 2:49:01| Again, you're crossing the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| No, I've never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10143)|
| 2:49:04| I just, I have from time to time asked the audience their opinion, a show of hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10144)|
| 2:49:08| but I always just stand up and just say here's what's on the agenda that I think would be of interest to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10148)|
| 2:49:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10157)|
| 2:49:20| The way I took the Fanzler decision was that discussion equaled deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10160)|
| 2:49:30| I'm not going to tell you how I feel about that, but I think it's very far reaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10170)|
| 2:49:37| Mr. Law Director, let's say you're a speaker at an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10177)|
| 2:49:43| It could be a Republican club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10183)|
| 2:49:46| It could be any function, and you're the speaker or you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10186)|
| 2:49:50| and the audience or someone in the audience wants to know what your opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10190)|
| 2:49:55| or how you're going to vote on a certain issue that's coming before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| and there happens to be other commissioners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| Are you allowed to invoke your First Amendment right and say how you feel about that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10202)|
| 2:50:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10210)|
| 2:50:11| Again, you avoid deliberating one with the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| If you're going to answer questions directly from a member of the audience, that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| What you don't want to do is get into a situation where you're bringing another commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| into the conversation and then starting to deliberate or debate the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10228)|
| 2:50:29| Why don't they ask the second commissioner the same question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| I just had a question because over the next eight to ten months we're going to see this come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10233)|
| 2:50:38| and it's inevitable when you get a group of elected people and you're going to fundraisers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10238)|
| 2:50:44| other people's fundraisers or whatever, the questions when we run into each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10244)|
| 2:50:49| have you heard is anyone running against you in the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| It's more politics and not anything that would be deliberated at this meeting or this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10251)|
| 2:50:59| Is that forbidden topics or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| No, sir, I wouldn't say it is because, again, the way the Tennessee Code defines a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10263)|
| 2:51:07| it's the convening of a governing body for which a quorum is required in order to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10267)|
| 2:51:13| or to deliberate toward a decision on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| So if you're at a Republican club meeting and there's several other commissions there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| or a Democratic club meeting and there's other commissioners there and someone says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| hey, you have any opposition, you can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| They can also say, hey, how did you vote on guns in parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| What you don't want to say is while I'm up here, Commissioner so-and-so is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| and he and I disagree and then you start debating the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| Again, a lot of this is just ore of impropriety than it is black letter law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| because we haven't been given that much guidance as old as this law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10299)|
| 2:51:43| When you have the Tennessee Supreme Court wringing its hands and saying it's baffled by the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10303)|
| 2:51:48| that there's no definitive definitions, you know you have to err in favor of prudence and caution in these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10308)|
| 2:51:56| Let's take it one step further then, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| A lot of stuff we go to the shoppers, the media is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10318)|
| 2:52:03| Is that permissible with the media sitting there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10323)|
| 2:52:08| Do you mean to deliberate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10330)|
| 2:52:11| No, I mean you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10331)|
| 2:52:13| A public meeting has to be duly noticed and it can't be noticed by an inference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10333)|
| 2:52:17| So unless you put out a public notice and say on this date, then you can do anything you'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10337)|
| 2:52:23| because you duly noticed it, the public is unnoticed, but you can't infer notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10343)|
| 2:52:28| E-mails go out every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10348)|
| 2:52:29| Take the Hollis Business Professional Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| E-mails go out every month to the club members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10351)|
| 2:52:34| And the media is there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| What if a discussion happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10356)|
| 2:52:37| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10357)|
| 2:52:38| No, you should avoid any kind of deliberation or discussion unless you duly notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10358)|
| 2:52:44| Again, because you're basically saying it's noticed by inference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| It has to be definitively, purposefully noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| Not noticed by, oh, we were fortunate that the media happened to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| It has to be, it's a duly noticed public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| I know that's what we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10377)|
| 2:52:58| Joe Lee has always put the notices out and that's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| But I have been asked from others is, you know, if there's a regular scheduled monthly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10381)|
| 2:53:06| does Joe Lee still have to send something out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| Well, if the possibility that there are going to be two more commissioners there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10389)|
| 2:53:13| and there is the possibility that it could go beyond just banter and get into deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10393)|
| 2:53:19| it's always wise to have the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10399)|
| 2:53:22| In other words, merely because the media shows up doesn't cure an Open Meetings Act violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10402)|
| 2:53:31| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| Mr. Chairman, I served on a statewide committee that looked at this very thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| and we spent most of our time talking about what is the difference between discussion and deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10416)|
| 2:53:40| I will tell you that even members of the media agree that public officials, elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10420)|
| 2:53:45| should be able to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| The deliberation is a fine line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| There is no definition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10429)|
| 2:53:50| We asked the legislature if they would define it and they refused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| I don't think we're going to get the legislature to tackle this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10434)|
| 2:53:58| It's too political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| And until they do, we're just kind of stuck in this never, never land with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10439)|
| 2:54:04| what is discussion, what is deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| But I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| KCEA, for example, will invite a number of commissioners to come and be part of a roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10448)|
| 2:54:16| Now, that's noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| If it's noticed, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10458)|
| 2:54:19| And so we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10459)|
| 2:54:20| Now, someone needs to take notes, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Someone should keep minutes, and those minutes should be available for public inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10464)|
| 2:54:29| How detailed should those minutes be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10469)|
| 2:54:32| Once again, the legislature has failed to get any specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10472)|
| 2:54:36| This is what it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10477)|
| 2:54:38| The minutes of a meeting of any governmental body shall be promptly and fully recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| shall be open to public inspection, and shall include but not be limited to a record of persons present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| all motions, proposals, and resolutions offered, the results of any votes taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10487)|
| 2:54:51| and a record of individual votes in the event of a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| So the bottom line is it doesn't say, when it says fully recorded, again, it doesn't even define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10494)|
| 2:55:00| But prudence dictates, I mean, an audio recording is the safest bet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10500)|
| 2:55:06| or someone who's taking copious notes on a laptop is probably secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10506)|
| 2:55:10| But that's what you've been dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10510)|
| 2:55:15| Just, Commissioner Hampton, interject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| You get to the minutes, and even the Tennessee handbook talks about minutes are usually items that have been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10519)|
| 2:55:27| A motion is made, it's taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| So if it's just a discussion on an item that if it were to go beyond and into deliberation, there's no formal vote taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10529)|
| 2:55:43| So how do you take motion minutes on something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10543)|
| 2:55:48| It's still a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| Well, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10550)|
| 2:55:51| I was reading to you verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10551)|
| 2:55:52| It basically reads that they should be fully recorded and include but not limited to a record of persons present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10552)|
| 2:55:57| all motions, proposals, resolutions offered, and votes taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| So you could essentially say there was a meeting on this date, the following persons were present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10560)|
| 2:56:05| the following issues were discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| If there's no vote, there's no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| My point is it's not clear, it's not spelled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10569)|
| 2:56:14| and the legislature has shown that it is not going to take on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10574)|
| 2:56:19| And so I think that we're just kind of stuck with where we are, and we just have to be careful and be prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10579)|
| 2:56:24| and continue doing what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| I think what we're doing has met the court's muster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| and so we just need to continue to notice everything, keep notes, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10588)|
| 2:56:34| Did you want the final word, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10594)|
| 2:56:37| Can I have the final word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10597)|
| 2:56:41| I think what I would like to say is as we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10601)|
| 2:56:44| I've got my line on if you want the final word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| I'll not take the final word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10611)|
| 2:56:52| I think that what we've discussed here for a few minutes illustrates the point that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10612)|
| 2:56:58| let me back up to being the junior commissioner in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10618)|
| 2:57:03| Phil Ballard and I never talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| We didn't attend meetings together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| We didn't call each other on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| Except during that period of time, I remember talking on the phone with him three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10632)|
| 2:57:17| one of which I still remember the other two have gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10637)|
| 2:57:21| That's all the communication, except being here seated in this big room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10641)|
| 2:57:26| that's all the communication that I had with Phil Ballard during that particular period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10646)|
| 2:57:32| because I stood under what I thought to be a real restrained or constrained position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10652)|
| 2:57:40| As we've discussed it today, though, things are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10660)|
| 2:57:45| It's been pointed out by Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| We do not have the final answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| We can still discuss situations and positions that we might be in where we just need to turn and walk away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10670)|
| 2:57:59| and that be the better part of the discretion of how we discuss things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10679)|
| 2:58:06| I just wanted us to stop and pause for just a second to hear each other verbalize the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10686)|
| 2:58:12| as far as Open Meetings Act is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10692)|
| 2:58:17| I view things to be different today than they were February a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10697)|
| 2:58:25| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10707)|
| 2:58:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| Commissioner Hammond, not only do they not want to tackle the Open Meetings Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10710)|
| 2:58:34| they don't wish to apply it to themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10714)|
| 2:58:38| I find that a little bit hypocritical that the highest legislative body in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10718)|
| 2:58:45| doesn't wish to adhere to an Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10725)|
| 2:58:51| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10731)|
| 2:58:52| I will say just one thing on minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| Minutes do not have to be taken by Mr. Foster Arnett's first-while crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10734)|
| 2:59:00| I mean, the bottom line is if you have a couple of commissioners together speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10740)|
| 2:59:04| anyone is appropriate to take minutes in those endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10744)|
| 2:59:06| It doesn't have to be a certified member of the clerk's office with apparatus for court reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10746)|
| 2:59:12| It's just a matter of somebody designated to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10752)|
| 2:59:15| So if the media says, I understood two commissioners met for lunch, discussed county business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10755)|
| 2:59:19| obviously there should be something they can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10759)|
| 2:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10766)|
| 2:59:27| Next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| You withdrew the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| Page 17 at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10773)|
| 2:59:38| Discussion regarding placement of county sale on all county vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10778)|
| 2:59:43| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10783)|
| 2:59:46| We voted 5-0 to send a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| Am I recognized, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| This dovetails with the debate that we've had about GPS a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10795)|
| 3:00:04| Vehicles have, of course, they're one of the sources of mistrust within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10804)|
| 3:00:11| There have been many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| And I just thought that I would offer it to the commission for discussion that I want to see if there is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10814)|
| 3:00:23| that I don't understand about every vehicle, virtually every vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10823)|
| 3:00:27| and I know that outside of the sheriff's office, every vehicle, the sheriff obviously has reasons to not have seals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10827)|
| 3:00:40| and obvious markers of certain vehicles, but outside of the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10840)|
| 3:00:47| it seems to me that every vehicle in Knox County, there would be a certain level of accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10847)|
| 3:00:56| by having a county seal, either the seal or a departmental decal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10856)|
| 3:01:05| I did a little bit of research on those, and it turns out that the county seal painted on a vehicle is a fairly expensive item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10865)|
| 3:01:15| whereas the departmental decal, which can be made at the public works department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10875)|
| 3:01:23| is just a matter of pennies to place on a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10883)|
| 3:01:28| We have some 130 vehicles or so outside of the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10888)|
| 3:01:34| and it's just a question to me why all of those don't have some kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10894)|
| 3:01:40| and I'm talking about the driver's side decal and the passenger side front seat decal next to their door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10900)|
| 3:01:49| why those are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| I wanted to place that for discussion, hear and hear comments from my colleagues about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10911)|
| 3:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| I think this is an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| I think it coincides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| I go around to surplus shows and surplus stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10928)|
| 3:02:13| A lot of military surplus you'll see has property of U.S. government on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10933)|
| 3:02:17| and I think this would be very much the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10937)|
| 3:02:21| A lot of companies that provide company vehicles to their employees put advertisements on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10941)|
| 3:02:29| They do it for advertisement reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| and I think we could also do it to advertise Knox County and promote Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| And also, if there truly is a Knox County vehicle at Dollywood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10957)|
| 3:02:43| most cell phones now are also cameras, so a picture could be taken of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10963)|
| 3:02:48| It would be really simple to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10968)|
| 3:02:51| Tony, would you like to make that as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| We're still in session, and we can pass something if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| I'd second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10976)|
| 3:02:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10977)|
| 3:02:58| I'll make it as a motion and then to have all vehicles outside the sheriff's department marked with a decal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10978)|
| 3:03:08| or preferably a decal that could be made by the public works department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10988)|
| 3:03:13| that identifies their department or that they are being used in official business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=10993)|
| 3:03:21| Yes, that would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| Okay, and I'd like to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11007)|
| 3:03:29| This is a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| If we wish to make a motion out of a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| we have to suspend the rules to bring forth a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11013)|
| 3:03:37| So if someone wishes to suspend the rules, then we would vote on that and then get back to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11017)|
| 3:03:43| just to make sure that we follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| We had this discussion earlier about whether or not we were following Robert's rule of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11025)|
| 3:03:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11029)|
| 3:03:50| This is in addition to the agenda, so I will make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| I believe it takes two-thirds to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| And it takes a two-thirds vote to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| My question is, I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| Mr. Norman, you said pennies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| What is pennies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11043)|
| 3:04:04| Okay, I think it was somewhere in the range of 50 cents per decal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11044)|
| 3:04:09| That's not for the Knox County decal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11049)|
| 3:04:11| That's for the department decal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| That's for departmental decals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11053)|
| 3:04:14| That's not for the county seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11054)|
| 3:04:16| Now, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| If it's 50 cents, we're not talking about any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| But what was it for the county decals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| I didn't get an exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11064)|
| 3:04:27| But I knew it was expensive for the seal to be painted on the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11067)|
| 3:04:33| Well, do you think it would be appropriate to withdraw this till we see what we're going to do on the GPS things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11073)|
| 3:04:42| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11082)|
| 3:04:43| Whatever the will is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| I don't think we need both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11085)|
| 3:04:46| I realize if we go for the department decal, you know you're talking about 50 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| Well, I think we need some kind of identification on all cars outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11094)|
| 3:04:56| So I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| Let's see what happens with our procedure here as far as suspending the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11099)|
| 3:05:07| That's what I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11107)|
| 3:05:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11108)|
| 3:05:09| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11109)|
| 3:05:10| And the second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11110)|
| 3:05:11| I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11111)|
| 3:05:12| Just a minute, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| Now, you say this is around 50 cents a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| Yeah, and that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11118)|
| 3:05:19| We're only going to have how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| I don't know how many cars it involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| And that was another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| I was possibly going to offer to departments the opportunity to tell us how many cars that would involve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11125)|
| 3:05:34| and if there is some justification for not marking them that I don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11134)|
| 3:05:39| Would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11139)|
| 3:05:40| Is anyone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| I don't guess anyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11142)|
| 3:05:43| Dwight, how many cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11143)|
| 3:05:45| We're looking at 151 for the GPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| Would there be any more than that when you exclude the sheriff's cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11147)|
| 3:05:52| Excuse me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| Let me give the body some updated numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| That figure of 151 came in in committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| That was introduced by Mike Reeves as the number of take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11159)|
| 3:06:03| And as Mr. Troyer said earlier, that number is a little bit out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| Under the executive branch, under the mayor's supervision, there are 265 street legal vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11167)|
| 3:06:12| That includes dump trucks, pickup and side panel trucks, passenger cars, and things like that, 265.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11172)|
| 3:06:21| Around 101 of those are assigned to employees that have take-home privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11181)|
| 3:06:26| Outside the executive branch, there's a total of 512 street legal vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11186)|
| 3:06:31| Obviously, the majority of those are in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11191)|
| 3:06:34| I think there's probably about 20 or 25 that are in other offices, property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11194)|
| 3:06:41| The clerk has a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11201)|
| 3:06:42| The clerk has a few, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11202)|
| 3:06:44| I think there's two in the district attorney's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11204)|
| 3:06:48| But the bulk of those are in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| So there's 265 that are under executive branch and off the cuff probably 20 or so that are in other offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11210)|
| 3:06:59| Any idea how many of those aren't already marked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11222)|
| 3:07:03| The property assessor's vehicles, to the best of my knowledge, are marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| And I will say this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| Many, many of those under the executive branch are marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11229)|
| 3:07:12| For instance, Doug Battelle has a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| He tries to have all white vehicles with green Knox County Parks and Recreation emblems on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11234)|
| 3:07:19| So they're pretty much provided for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11239)|
| 3:07:22| Most of the vehicles in Mr. Weetrick's fleet, the dump trucks and service trucks, those are all already pretty clearly marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11242)|
| 3:07:31| Now, they're marked differently from obviously the ones at Parks and Recreation, but they're clearly marked as Knox County vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11251)|
| 3:07:38| If it's something the body would like us to give some examination to, we'd certainly be glad to and come back and give you a report if that helps any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11258)|
| 3:07:47| Well, just running some quick figures, you're talking about roughly about 250 cars it seems like at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11267)|
| 3:07:53| Well, you're talking about $175.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| I can go for that, but I think we ought to make each department just pay for their own no more than it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11275)|
| 3:08:01| Of course, this would include the mayor's vehicle, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11284)|
| 3:08:05| Because it's not marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11285)|
| 3:08:06| One of the things that we'd need to look at, and again, this is one reason I'm not so averse to sitting in this role for a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11286)|
| 3:08:12| is I actually think that the policy may already require all but senior directors and the mayor's vehicles to be marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11292)|
| 3:08:22| So, I'd like to think that we're largely compliant in most departments with that, but until we actually get out and give it a look, I couldn't say for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11302)|
| 3:08:30| Well, we're talking about roughly $175, and that wouldn't be any drain on any department for them to mark their own cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11310)|
| 3:08:37| So, I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11317)|
| 3:08:42| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11322)|
| 3:08:43| Well, we don't have a motion yet, so let me make a motion to suspend the rules to allow this resolution from Commissioner Norman to proceed about the decaling of executive branch vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11323)|
| 3:08:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11339)|
| 3:09:00| I'd like to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| We'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11342)|
| 3:09:03| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11343)|
| 3:09:04| I would like to amend that, Commissioner Norman, if you would accept an amendment on it that each department take care of their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| and they be the departments only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| Well, first of all, this is just a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11351)|
| 3:09:15| To hear the motion, and that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11355)|
| 3:09:19| Go ahead, Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11359)|
| 3:09:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11360)|
| 3:09:21| What about me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11361)|
| 3:09:22| I thought you had me on there once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11362)|
| 3:09:23| No, you don't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| Regarding suspending the rules, we did not suspend the rules on the stormwater motion and amendment, which was just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11365)|
| 3:09:32| If that's the case, and if we're in violation of the rules on that motion, I would like Commissioner Harmon to amend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11372)|
| 3:09:43| where we could go back and correct our error on the stormwater one also by suspending the rules for stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11383)|
| 3:09:49| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11389)|
| 3:09:50| I should have included other executive agencies as well in my motion, and I do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11390)|
| 3:09:55| So, if we could just suspend the rules on any motions made for discussion tonight, I guess that's where I'm headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| Then we can go back and revisit the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| Well, I would prefer that they be split because I'm going to vote differently on those suspensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11401)|
| 3:10:07| I'm suspending the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| We're going to take one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11411)|
| 3:10:12| We're going to deal with this one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11412)|
| 3:10:15| Then we can go back to the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| I think I have something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| You have something to say, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11420)|
| 3:10:24| Yeah, I'd like to ask Grant Rosenberg if any vehicles in the codes that would not need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11424)|
| 3:10:30| would you not rather have them identified when they're out in the field maybe investigating a serious situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11430)|
| 3:10:40| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11440)|
| 3:10:41| We hadn't really given it much thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| All of our vehicles in our department have government tags on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11443)|
| 3:10:49| so it's not like it would be that much of a secret if we were creeping around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11449)|
| 3:10:55| It's something we'll have to think about and talk to my staff and see what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11455)|
| 3:11:00| But we're certainly open to the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11460)|
| 3:11:02| We have no problem with it necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11462)|
| 3:11:06| Just had that thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11466)|
| 3:11:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11467)|
| 3:11:11| We have a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11471)|

| 3:12:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11538)|
| 3:12:19| Motion carries 18-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11539)|
| 3:12:20| Did you want to make a motion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11540)|
| 3:12:24| So the same motion that I previously made, that all county vehicles have a county seal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11544)|
| 3:12:33| or a marking or a county decal, which designates for official use on both the driver's side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11553)|
| 3:12:45| and the passenger side doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| You wanted to exclude sheriffs from that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| Excluding the sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11570)|
| 3:12:52| You're adding the seal now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11572)|
| 3:12:54| Either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11574)|
| 3:12:55| For some there will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11575)|
| 3:12:56| They already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| We don't know what the seal is going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| You say they're expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| I don't want to be wasting a lot of money, the taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| That's if they're painted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11586)|
| 3:13:07| Now, they can get a stick-on seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| Well, we still don't know the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11589)|
| 3:13:10| So stick-on seals cost, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11590)|
| 3:13:12| He's talking about this department is going to be done in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11592)|
| 3:13:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11595)|
| 3:13:16| In-house, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11596)|
| 3:13:18| They can do it in-house on the seals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| Okay, let's just use the language of at least a departmental seal in a decal form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11601)|
| 3:13:28| which indicates official Knox County use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11608)|
| 3:13:32| And for the departments to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11612)|
| 3:13:35| That's fine, for the departments to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11615)|
| 3:13:37| Except that it's a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| That's accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| Does the second agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11623)|
| 3:13:44| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11624)|
| 3:13:49| Commissioner, I have an army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| I just want to know if that means all motorized vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11631)|
| 3:13:55| You know they have a lot of equipment that may need to be marked, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11635)|
| 3:13:59| Okay, I'm just talking about automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11639)|
| 3:14:01| I'm assuming that work vehicles are being marked, but any vehicle that's used by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11641)|
| 3:14:09| Street legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| Street legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11651)|
| 3:14:12| Vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11652)|
| 3:14:13| Commissioner Fondas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11655)|
| 3:14:16| Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| what about the concern that Mr. Van de Veet brought up that there already may be a policy in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11658)|
| 3:14:26| to have these marked except for the senior directors and the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11666)|
| 3:14:30| Do we want to make an exception or do you intend for all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11670)|
| 3:14:33| No, I really think they all should be marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11673)|
| 3:14:43| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| Yeah, I'm going to make a substitute motion and ask that the mayor's office take a look at this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11686)|
| 3:14:56| and report back to us next month so that we have an idea of exactly how many vehicles we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11696)|
| 3:15:05| whether or not there might be some vehicles that may necessitate not being marked for a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11705)|
| 3:15:17| Instead of it just being this broad sort of what's a decal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11717)|
| 3:15:22| How big is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| Do we want it on both sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11724)|
| 3:15:26| And to come back with exactly what they're going to put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11726)|
| 3:15:31| Because I think if we're going to move forward on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11731)|
| 3:15:34| I think Bruce Weitrich's department could come back with maybe a design that they can print up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11734)|
| 3:15:40| so that we can be uniform and place that on the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11740)|
| 3:15:45| I think by putting this off by one month and then maybe we get what we're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11745)|
| 3:15:51| and we're more uniformed and we know exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11751)|
| 3:15:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| Move second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11760)|
| 3:16:04| You heard them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11764)|
| 3:16:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11765)|

| 3:16:10| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11770)|
| 3:16:12| Make that two no's and my light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11772)|
| 3:16:16| I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11776)|
| 3:16:18| That counts for two no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11778)|
| 3:16:20| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11780)|
| 3:16:23| And I don't guess the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11783)|
| 3:16:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11784)|
| 3:16:25| Seventeen ayes, two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11785)|

| 3:19:38| All 19 are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11978)|
| 3:19:40| Before we get started, I want to introduce a couple of Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11980)|
| 3:19:45| I was fortunate, and I hope Commissioner Brown and Pinkston don't care to know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11985)|
| 3:19:52| but I went to speak over in South Knoxville to this Boy Scout group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11992)|
| 3:19:59| and I'd like for them to just stand up for a commission to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=11999)|
| 3:20:06| And I'd like to welcome up way up in Stephen Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12006)|
| 3:20:12| Hey, Harold, you were in the Boy Scouts too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12012)|
| 3:20:20| They didn't have Boy Scouts when Harold and I was young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12020)|
| 3:20:26| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12026)|
| 3:20:29| Good thing they look like Sylvia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12029)|
| 3:20:34| Commissioner Clark, can we get number A, A1, 5A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12034)|
| 3:20:38| 5A-09-RZ is a request of the Pavilion at Hunter Valley Farm, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12038)|

| 3:20:57| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12057)|
| 3:21:00| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| Mr. Seymour, Junior 550, West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12062)|
| 3:21:05| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| 4th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12068)|
| 3:21:12| I would move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12072)|
| 3:21:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12074)|
| 3:21:15| For MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12075)|
| 3:21:16| For MPC, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12076)|
| 3:21:18| Recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12078)|
| 3:21:22| And you seconded Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12082)|
| 3:21:24| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12085)|
| 3:21:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12087)|
| 3:21:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| While I do favor this, Mr. Seymour, this looks like asking for forgiveness rather than permission on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12093)|
| 3:21:41| It is, and it wasn't really discovered on a complaint basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12101)|
| 3:21:45| It was discovered by Nancy and her mother in an investigation of what they were doing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12105)|
| 3:21:54| They simply did not realize the agricultural zone did not permit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12114)|
| 3:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12123)|
| 3:22:04| 9-B-09-RZ is a request of Clinton R. King for rezoning from R.B. General Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12124)|
| 3:22:10| and P.C. Planned Commercial to C.B. Business and Manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12130)|
| 3:22:14| The property is located northwest side of Rutledge Pike, northeast of Woods Creek Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12134)|
| 3:22:20| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12140)|
| 3:22:27| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12147)|
| 3:22:31| Seeing none, 8th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12151)|
| 3:22:34| There is a difference between the request and the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12154)|
| 3:22:40| Could M.P.C. give us just a brief thumbnail of what that difference might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12160)|
| 3:22:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12166)|
| 3:22:47| This is an I've had a couple of conversations with Mr. King and Ms. King about the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12167)|
| 3:22:53| They came before M.P.C. back in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12173)|
| 3:22:57| I think they're in the process of trying to get prepared to sell the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12177)|
| 3:23:01| and they wanted to get rezoning for obvious reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12181)|
| 3:23:06| This is in a part of this Rutledge Pike corridor where you have some topography as you go up to a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12186)|
| 3:23:14| There's already some planned commercial zoning in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12194)|
| 3:23:17| and we felt like the planned commercial zone would allow him to sell it for commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12197)|
| 3:23:21| but would also give the opportunity to review a site plan whenever the new property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12201)|
| 3:23:27| or subsequent property owner comes in with a site plan so we can try to do as best we can to protect that ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12207)|
| 3:23:34| We feel like there's going to be some land available for commercial development down closer to Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12214)|
| 3:23:40| but we felt like the planned commercial zone was a little better in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12220)|
| 3:23:44| allow site plan review, allow us to work with a developer to see how we can really properly develop that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12224)|
| 3:23:51| In reviewing the minutes of M.P.C., it looked as though, Mr. King, you agree with what they're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12231)|
| 3:23:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12238)|
| 3:23:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| I move that this be approved per M.P.C. recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12240)|
| 3:24:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12246)|
| 3:24:07| Buzz, this would require amending an existing sector plan, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12247)|
| 3:24:12| No, sir, it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12252)|
| 3:24:13| Would not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12253)|
| 3:24:14| It seems to indicate that on our crib notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12254)|
| 3:24:19| Double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12259)|
| 3:24:20| No, that's the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12260)|
| 3:24:21| Oh, sorry, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12261)|
| 3:24:24| My apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12264)|
| 3:24:25| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12265)|
| 3:24:26| I'll be glad to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12266)|
| 3:24:28| No, it proposes commercial use and slope retention of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12268)|
| 3:24:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12271)|
| 3:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12275)|
| 3:24:36| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12276)|
| 3:24:38| We have a motion, property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12278)|
| 3:24:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12280)|
| 3:24:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12281)|
| 3:24:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12282)|
| 3:24:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12284)|
| 3:24:47| Next two, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12287)|
| 3:24:50| These are requests of Rocky Hill Land Partners, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12290)|
| 3:24:53| 9B-09-SP is for a southwest county sector plan amendment from agricultural and rural residential to O office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12293)|
| 3:25:03| and SLPA slope protection to LDR low density residential and SLPA slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12303)|
| 3:25:10| 9-D-09-RZ is for rezoning from OB office medical and related services to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12310)|
| 3:25:18| They're both located southeast side of South North Shore Drive, southwest of Whitt Tower Drive in the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12318)|
| 3:25:28| Let me ask the applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| I'm John Buckingham, 620 Market Street, representing the applicant in both of these requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12331)|
| 3:25:37| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12337)|
| 3:25:40| Commissioner Schaaf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| These are great projects and just the technicalities, I think, that required it to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12343)|
| 3:25:48| But would you, John, would you differentiate between the two for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12348)|
| 3:25:52| Between the SP and the RZ just so we'll know and the public will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12352)|
| 3:25:57| The SP is the sector plan, and the sector plan is now showing office and slope protection for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12357)|
| 3:26:09| And in order for us to do what we'd like to do, which is to subdivide the property, it has to be changed to low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12369)|
| 3:26:19| And the RZ is the rezoning request that we also have, and that is to rezone the property from OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12379)|
| 3:26:28| which permitted the condo development that we have already started out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12388)|
| 3:26:33| and does not permit the subdivision of the property into units so that we can sell them, as we've learned from the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12393)|
| 3:26:44| If you don't own a piece, if you aren't going to own a piece of dirt, they won't loan you money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12404)|
| 3:26:49| That's the two big houses or residences on the hill split in the condo each, I think, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12409)|
| 3:26:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12416)|
| 3:26:57| That was used both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| Yes. Up on the hill, they've already built three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12419)|
| 3:27:02| Two of them are connected, and they will then be, they'll have a zero lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12422)|
| 3:27:09| They'll have a lot line, and the other one is slightly separated, and that's the one, actually, that we already have sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12429)|
| 3:27:15| We just can't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| And so we're asking that it be rezoned to plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12437)|
| 3:27:21| It was approved at MPC with some conditions, and there were the need for some variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12441)|
| 3:27:28| All of that has been approved, and we're just awaiting the commission's approval here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12448)|
| 3:27:33| I move its approval on both SP and RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12453)|
| 3:27:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12457)|
| 3:27:39| Per MPC recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| Yes, per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| On both, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12463)|
| 3:27:44| On both, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12464)|
| 3:27:51| Commissioner Nauman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12471)|
| 3:27:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12474)|
| 3:27:55| Sorry to slow things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12475)|
| 3:27:59| This, I don't know how many of you all had a chance to look at the photos of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12479)|
| 3:28:04| and this is going to, this is way before us, and this is going to pass, and this is going to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12484)|
| 3:28:11| But people that are concerned with hillside protection probably are somewhat taken aback by the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12491)|
| 3:28:20| the way it was done, and I think the phrase is called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12500)|
| 3:28:27| this is the missing tooth in reference to a forested hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12507)|
| 3:28:33| which this plot is right in the middle of this well-forested hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12513)|
| 3:28:42| So I just had a question for Buzz or for Mark in terms of when the development first took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12522)|
| 3:28:54| did we have site plan review on how they were going to do the grading, how this first started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12534)|
| 3:29:05| Did we have some considerations or slope and discussions about retention of forest cover at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12545)|
| 3:29:13| No, we didn't, and it was done under the office designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12553)|
| 3:29:17| You can do residential under the office designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12557)|
| 3:29:21| consistent with the requirements, I believe, of the RB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| but it was not at a density that required site plan review by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12564)|
| 3:29:30| You know, if it had, we might have been able to address some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12570)|
| 3:29:35| that we've been trying to address here for the last year and a half or so, but the die was already cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12575)|
| 3:29:41| There was no way to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12581)|
| 3:29:44| They have come in with a site plan consistent with this zoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12584)|
| 3:29:49| and it's continued upon this zoning going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12589)|
| 3:29:52| and we've tried to at least work with restoring some of the vegetation on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12592)|
| 3:29:58| especially on the backside of the site, which you really can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12598)|
| 3:30:02| It's beyond the two houses heading south, looking south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12602)|
| 3:30:06| So we have tried what we can do under the circumstances, restore some of the vegetation on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12606)|
| 3:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12614)|
| 3:30:15| And if I might add, the applicant is willing to go along with exactly what MPC is requiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12615)|
| 3:30:22| Okay, and I appreciate that, and I appreciate Cheryl's efforts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12622)|
| 3:30:26| I noticed that it's in the Fourth Creek watershed, and I probably had said, I don't want to go on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12626)|
| 3:30:33| I mean, I'm going to vote to approve it, but just for the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| this is some of the efforts of the Hillside Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12637)|
| 3:30:40| These are the kinds of things that we're trying to make sure we have in policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12640)|
| 3:30:46| which helps us to avoid possibly what we would call a little bit too heavy-handed approach to a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12646)|
| 3:30:59| This development could have been done, I think, in a much more subtle and sensitive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12659)|
| 3:31:05| and still had the same buildings built, the same condominium development done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12665)|
| 3:31:11| and certainly that's one of our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12673)|
| 3:31:14| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12674)|
| 3:31:16| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12678)|

| 3:32:11| 7th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12731)|
| 3:32:12| Move to approve per MPC staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12732)|
| 3:32:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12736)|
| 3:32:17| Staff recommendation or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12737)|
| 3:32:19| Do you have to be technical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12739)|
| 3:32:21| Both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12741)|
| 3:32:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12742)|
| 3:32:23| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| I just need a few to wait, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12747)|
| 3:32:28| You woke me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12748)|
| 3:32:31| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12751)|
| 3:32:32| I would note that this was both a sector plan change and that the MPC recommended office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12752)|
| 3:32:38| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12758)|
| 3:32:42| We have a motion on the floor to approve both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12762)|

| 3:32:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12768)|
| 3:32:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12769)|

| 3:33:17| 8th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12797)|

| 3:33:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| Do you want this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| Just MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12810)|
| 3:33:31| Actually, in this case, the staff recommendation was slightly different than what the planning commission approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12811)|
| 3:33:37| so go with the planning commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12817)|
| 3:33:40| MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12820)|
| 3:33:43| Does the MPC recommendation include the landscaping screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12823)|

| 3:34:16| It says deferred by a sponsor's request underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091026?start=12856)|
