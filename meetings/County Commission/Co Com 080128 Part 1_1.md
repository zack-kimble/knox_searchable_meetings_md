| 2:38:14| I understand there would be a net gain, but even if it's a super Walmart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9494)|
| 2:38:18| the people in the halls or in that whole general area are buying their groceries somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9498)|
| 2:38:22| So, and I'm not saying there wouldn't be a net at all, but I'm just, you know, I don't have a hard number here to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9502)|
| 2:38:30| And it's not that I don't wish you luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| And if it comes back before and the IDB board ends up, if it gets to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| they come back with a number and it can answer my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| And then, you know, maybe at that point I can support it, but right now tonight I just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| I'm just asking tonight for the ability to go to the IDB so that they can do their analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9523)|
| 2:38:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9531)|
| 2:38:52| I'm not asking for the tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9532)|
| 2:38:53| Okay, let me just say one thing about we're not going to be here in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| We may not be sitting on this board in 15 years, but me and my two kids, they'll be driving by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9536)|
| 2:39:02| And I think the safety of roading conditions in the 7th District will be better because of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9542)|
| 2:39:09| and other work done by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| So, you know, I've helped support everybody else in their districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9551)|
| 2:39:15| And I would support doing the road improvements that need to be done in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9555)|
| 2:39:21| You will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9561)|
| 2:39:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| Bruce Weitrich before us to say that this is what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| If you could put that in your resolution, I'm willing to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| I'm willing to go by what Mr. Weitrich says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| If that needs to be in the resolution, I'm happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| My numbers are not scientific, but my business is close to a super Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| When it went from a standard Walmart to a super Walmart, their business, from the looks of the cars in the driveway, it doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:56| And as far as the amount of business that is coming across the county line, and, again, this is completely unscientific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9596)|
| 2:40:04| but I've driven through the shopping centers there on Clinton Highway several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9604)|
| 2:40:09| and counted the cars with Anderson County plates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| And usually there's up to a third of the cars in the parking lot are from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| they're either from across the county line or they're buying their tags across the county line to avoid the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| But there's about a third of the cars that have out-of-town plates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| Is that either Anderson or Union?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| Usually Anderson and Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| Yes, as the maker of the motion, I wanted to open this up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| I certainly wouldn't mind a substitute motion from Craig if he wanted to postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9637)|
| 2:40:42| until he could bring the number back, maybe in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9642)|
| 2:40:47| That's a question you'd need to ask this gentleman here if he has 30 days to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9647)|
| 2:40:53| Well, I think the IDB board only meets a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| Let them tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| Let them tell us what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| When's the next meeting? Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| The IDB board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9664)|
| 2:41:05| No, not off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| They only meet like every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9669)|
| 2:41:13| So if it's going to be in February, then he needs to get it done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:18| And, again, I'm asking, I will live with what Mr. Weitrich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| if Mr. Weitrich will go before the IDB, he's going to make his feelings known in no uncertain terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9683)|
| 2:41:30| And that IDB panel, if Mr. Weitrich says you only deserve a million out of the four and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9690)|
| 2:41:36| and I want the other, if he says you deserve two, that is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9696)|
| 2:41:41| He's going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| The IDB is going to take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| And it then still has to come back before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| It can come back saying we only support a half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| It can come back saying we support the full four and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9713)|
| 2:41:56| It's still up to this commission at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| I'm just asking it to go to the point that we can really roll our sleeves up with Mr. Weitrich| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9718)|
| 2:42:03| and the IDB to figure out exactly what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| If we need to change the resolution to say that the resolution is only supporting what Mr. Weitrich decides we deserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9727)|
| 2:42:15| again, I'm willing to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| Did you make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| He did and I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9739)|
| 2:42:20| Let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9741)|
| 2:42:22| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9742)|
| 2:42:23| I think everybody had time to decide which way they want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9743)|
| 2:42:26| So all in favor of sending it to the IDB board say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9751)|
| 2:42:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| Two, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9755)|
| 2:42:36| Raise your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9756)|
| 2:42:37| Commissioner Lutho and Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9757)|
| 2:42:41| Okay, motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9763)|
| 2:42:44| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| Thank you, Mr. Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9766)|
| 2:42:47| 406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9767)|
| 2:42:50| This is a resolution appropriating $300,000 for expenses incurred due to the Tedford Road fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:58| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| Intergovernmental had 5-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| 5-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| Okay, we've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:09| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| Commissioner Mark Harmon, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9790)|
| 2:43:13| A question for Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| Bruce Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| Bruce, any opportunity for us to recoup any of these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9800)|
| 2:43:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9808)|
| 2:43:29| It's our intention to go against the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| This is an illegal, basically it's a demolition landfill that has caught on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| He's been operating for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| We cited him in 2006, and he was actually fined for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| And we're out there, literally we're out there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| I got a report at 4 o'clock that it's still on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| It's smoking heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| And it's causing quite a bit of problem with the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| We get these air inversions where it pushes the air back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| Not only the smell, but the carbon monoxide levels are a problem also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| What about the water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9842)|
| 2:44:03| You've checked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| What about the air quality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| The air quality, we have been using a four-gas monitor at the site since the fire started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9846)|
| 2:44:11| Have not had any high levels measured with the exception of carbon monoxide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:16| It will occasionally spike when the smoke will drift through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9856)|
| 2:44:19| The Environmental Protection Agency sent us some canisters, evacuated canisters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:24| so some additional samples were taken by the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| We have not got those test results back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| Having said all that, we have had an inspector out there on the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| with the exception of maybe one hour during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| He may get out there by 8, 30, or 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9876)|
| 2:44:39| But we have not seen anything to lead us to believe there's anything other than stumps, logs, and mulch on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9879)|
| 2:44:45| However, I'm sure seeing it around and inhaling those fumes is not good for you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9885)|
| 2:44:52| Do you need additional trucks, people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| Do you need anything extra, or are you doing everything that you can now to keep it under control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9895)|
| 2:45:00| To answer your question directly, we're doing everything we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| Based on the topography of the site, the amount of room we have to work in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| and essentially what we're doing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| We've got three track hoes out there right now working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| We really couldn't fit any additional equipment out there at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| One final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| You were describing for me the size of this sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| Now, you had mentioned this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| Could you give us an idea of just how big this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| Easily, the amount of material that we have excavated and gone through would fit in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| To give you an idea of how deep it is, it's easily as deep as the ceiling in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9929)|
| 2:45:37| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| Yes, we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| Bruce, I know nothing about fighting underground fires, but it just seems to me, well, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9944)|
| 2:45:52| if you had this to do over again, would you do it the same way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9955)|
| 2:45:56| I think there's two scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| What you can do is try to cap it off, essentially smother the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| There was some attempt to do that initially on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| The other thing that I'm concerned about is we don't know exactly what is in this pile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9965)|
| 2:46:11| Here again, if you can imagine easily the size of this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| there's no telling what is actually buried in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| Again, having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| we've not seen anything to lead us to believe that it is nothing but brush and logs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| So essentially what we're doing is exactly what you do to put out a campfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| We're taking it out, stirring it, putting water on it, and extinguishing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| It is just a very slow, painstaking process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9990)|
| 2:46:34| Do people that fight fires use this procedure that you followed for fighting this fire or extinguishing this fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=9994)|
| 2:46:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10003)|
| 2:46:44| In fact, I spoke with Jerry Hunter, chief of rural metro fire department today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10004)|
| 2:46:48| and we were talking back and forth trying to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| was there anything else we need to do, think about doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| And he's saying, listen, from his estimation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| all is being done that can be done at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10015)|
| 2:47:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10021)|
| 2:47:02| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10025)|
| 2:47:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| I think the next item is 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10029)|
| 2:47:17| This resolution is confirming the appointment of Mr. Bruce Anderson as the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10037)|
| 2:47:23| regarding violations associated with ordinance 05-2-102 as amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10043)|
| 2:47:30| regulating sexually oriented businesses within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10055)|
| 2:47:36| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10056)|
| 2:47:37| Voted 4-0 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| 3-2, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| Mr. Law Director, I think we asked to send a letter to the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10064)|
| 2:47:49| And we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| I don't know that we've gotten a response back from the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| Mary Ann, did we receive anything back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10074)|
| 2:47:58| We have, and it should appear in their newsletter at the end of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10078)|
| 2:48:05| In addition to that, what we did following the work session was change this resolution to an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10085)|
| 2:48:14| So you probably have both in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10094)|
| 2:48:17| One, the resolution, which would deal with the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10097)|
| 2:48:22| or we prepared an ordinance pursuant to your request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10102)|
| 2:48:31| which would make this appointment a Knox County Commission appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:36| instead of that as selected by the mayor and approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10116)|
| 2:48:44| So you'll find that ordinance on first reading, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10124)|
| 2:48:50| It's 08-1-101 in your book, first ordinance in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:56| So what do we need to do on this one here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| Whatever it is you wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| If you wish to go forward with the resolution as has been prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| appointing Mr. Anderson as the hearing officer, that resolution is within your packet, I believe, as 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10146)|
| 2:49:15| If you choose to amend the ordinance to provide that, basically to amend the adult business ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10155)|
| 2:49:28| Article 2, Section 2.03, to provide that this is a commission appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10168)|
| 2:49:42| 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10182)|
| 2:49:43| It's 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10183)|
| 2:49:44| It's not 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10184)|
| 2:49:45| It's 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10185)|
| 2:49:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10186)|
| 2:49:51| Well, then I'd make a motion that we withdraw this and operate off of the Ordinance 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10191)|
| 2:50:06| That would require two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10208)|
| 2:50:09| And what would it do to the enforcement of what we currently have in the meantime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10209)|
| 2:50:15| Right now, currently, as far as I know, we don't have any outstanding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10215)|
| 2:50:22| Bruce Weitrick, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| Bruce has involvement with this ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10225)|
| 2:50:31| As far as I know, we don't have any appeals that are pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10231)|
| 2:50:35| There are applications in the process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| Applications are approved by the clerk or denied by the clerk, as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10239)|
| 2:50:46| Do we have any appeals that you know of, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10248)|
| 2:50:49| We've notified at least two of the known businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| I think there's a third business that we were under the mistaken impression that they had closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10251)|
| 2:50:55| so we're in the process of also notifying them about the licensing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10255)|
| 2:50:59| But two of the businesses already have been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| In fact, one had already had the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| We gave them 30 days, so they've probably got another couple weeks to turn all the applications in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10265)|
| 2:51:11| So as it stands right now, we have time to adopt the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10271)|
| 2:51:19| Plus, we only have, what, three in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10279)|
| 2:51:22| As far as we know, we only know of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| We've got a motion to withdraw this when it operate off of 104 on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10294)|
| 2:51:35| Second by Commissioner Ivanharmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10298)|
| 2:51:39| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10301)|
| 2:51:42| Mr. Mayor, why did you bring forward the appointment of Mr. Bruce Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10302)|
| 2:51:49| I wanted to pick someone who is a community leader, who had impeccable credentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| who was beyond any type of question an outstanding lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10314)|
| 2:51:59| Mr. Anderson is a graduate of the University of Tennessee College of Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10319)|
| 2:52:02| He's got his law degree from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| He's served clients like Children's Hospital and Team Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| He's listed among the best lawyers in America in the area of mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10329)|
| 2:52:13| His list of community services really rivals almost anyone in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10333)|
| 2:52:18| So I wanted to get a very outstanding individual, and I think you have that in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10338)|
| 2:52:23| Would he be willing to do this pro bono?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10343)|
| 2:52:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10345)|
| 2:52:26| I haven't asked him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10346)|
| 2:52:27| I think that was something that came up in our committee, was seeing if someone would do this on a pro bono basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10347)|
| 2:52:32| Mr. Law Director, with regards to this hearing officer, how important is this with regards to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10352)|
| 2:52:37| I mean, if you just put anybody in here and they make a wrong determination with regards to an appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10357)|
| 2:52:44| what type of liability do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| In other words, how important is it that the right person be selected for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10366)|
| 2:52:50| It's always extremely important that you get the right person for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10370)|
| 2:52:55| Anything that the hearing officer determines certainly is subject to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10375)|
| 2:53:00| We'd go to a chancery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10380)|
| 2:53:02| But you want to have the right person, someone with experience to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10382)|
| 2:53:07| Now, I know that there's been some talk of an attorney doing it pro bono,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10387)|
| 2:53:11| and that's the message that we sent out to the Knoxville Bar Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10391)|
| 2:53:15| which will be coming out in their newsletter next week or later this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10395)|
| 2:53:22| which is asking if anyone who practices law in Knox County would wish to take this on as a pro bono project for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10402)|
| 2:53:34| The way I wrote up the resolution was providing for a contract basically for Mr. Anderson at the rate of $175 per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10414)|
| 2:53:44| which is what we now pay outside counsel whenever Knox County attorneys have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10424)|
| 2:53:51| So it is the standard hourly rate, and I will say that it is a reduced hourly rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10431)|
| 2:53:57| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10437)|
| 2:53:58| I've not talked with Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| I don't know if Bruce would consider this for $175 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10439)|
| 2:54:05| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| But I know he's an excellent attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10447)|
| 2:54:10| So you feel he could be a hearing officer and be the type of person that we're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10454)|
| 2:54:17| I guess my point is that as you read the ordinance, the ordinance has a checks and balance in that the mayor recommends, we confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10457)|
| 2:54:26| So we are the body that's going to accept or reject this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10466)|
| 2:54:29| and I would think that if we wanted to bring forth a nomination as well, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| But there has to be a screening process for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10473)|
| 2:54:36| As you heard our law director say, you really need someone that is skilled in this type of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10476)|
| 2:54:41| or else you can get yourself into all types of issues with regards to courts, and I don't think that we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| I've known Mr. Anderson a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| I feel he's also capable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| So with regards to this, I don't really know the difference it makes whether it's a mayoral appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10491)|
| 2:54:57| or a county commission appointment because we have to confirm him anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| And if we choose, we can always reject the mayor or whoever the mayor is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10501)|
| 2:55:05| This ordinance is going to be in effect for many years down the road, whoever the mayor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10505)|
| 2:55:08| And the person who comes in, this body, can reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10508)|
| 2:55:12| So I'm going to vote for the resolution as is with Mr. Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:17| unless there is a compelling reason why Mr. Anderson could not fulfill this obligation and do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10517)|
| 2:55:24| Mr. Hammond, I'll just tell you my thought on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| was that this body passed the ordinance to have it in place anyway on adult businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10527)|
| 2:55:34| So it should be our appointment to put someone in there to do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10534)|
| 2:55:40| And we asked for someone, Mr. Anderson, to send his bio, and he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10540)|
| 2:55:45| But it doesn't talk about anything that he's represented doing adult business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10545)|
| 2:55:51| And he's going to go up against some good attorneys who have spent a lifetime representing adult businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10551)|
| 2:55:57| And I don't know that he has any experience in adult business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10557)|
| 2:56:01| And that's why I said there's many good attorneys out there that may do it pro bono,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10561)|
| 2:56:06| that may have some of that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| But to rush into something that's going to cost the taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| when there's only three stores in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10572)|
| 2:56:16| that we may have something next week or it may be two years before we have to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| And that was my thinking of why the ordinance should be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10580)|
| 2:56:25| Mr. Mayor, do you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10585)|
| 2:56:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| I think it may be helpful, Mr. Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| if you explained your role in this process representing Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10589)|
| 2:56:32| and the distinction between that and the role Mr. Anderson would play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10592)|
| 2:56:35| Well, Mr. Anderson, under the ordinance, is the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10595)|
| 2:56:39| And so no one from my office nor myself can sit in a hearing in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10599)|
| 2:56:47| As the Knox County attorney, we represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| So we will be certainly defending Knox County's interest and or prosecuting Knox County's interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10610)|
| 2:56:55| whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| And we're certainly prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| So you have an independent hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| whether it's a person chosen by the mayor and confirmed by this body or chosen by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:10| And then you would have certainly the applicant's attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| And we've met a number of those through the litigation over the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10635)|
| 2:57:18| So they're certainly capable attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10638)|
| 2:57:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10642)|
| 2:57:23| Mr. Law Director, if you have an attorney who may not be as knowledgeable in this field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10643)|
| 2:57:28| not that he's not a great attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10648)|
| 2:57:31| do we pay him just for the time he's sitting there as a hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10651)|
| 2:57:35| or do we pay him if he has to go back and research the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10655)|
| 2:57:38| and, you know, if he doesn't know anything about it and trying to figure it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| or we pay him for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| Like any other attorney, his clock starts ticking the moment he starts dealing with your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10663)|
| 2:57:52| And so that would originate from the time he starts thinking about whatever hearing it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10672)|
| 2:57:58| And I would assume that in a hearing like this there would be an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10678)|
| 2:58:03| and there would be certain information contained within the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| There would be a response from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10686)|
| 2:58:09| The hearing officer would have to familiarize himself or herself with the briefs that are filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10689)|
| 2:58:15| and then there would be a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| And the hearing takes place pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:21| Mr. Anderson has a lot of mediator experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10701)|
| 2:58:25| and that experience with him would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| Well, if you pick someone in this community who deals with that business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10709)|
| 2:58:34| would we not be taking someone off the street, off the market for these companies to be able to hire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10714)|
| 2:58:41| Oh, I'm not sure if we would or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| It just depends on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10723)|
| 2:58:44| Well, I mean, there's people in this town that you go to if you get a speeding ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10724)|
| 2:58:48| There's people in this town, lawyers that represent people in DUIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| You wouldn't want somebody that represents a speeding ticket to represent you on a DUI, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| I would venture to guess that we have 2,000 attorneys practicing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10735)|
| 2:59:01| Yeah, but how many practice every day in this courthouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| Not 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10743)|
| 2:59:04| Not too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10744)|
| 2:59:05| Not too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| And that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10747)|
| 2:59:08| We need to pick someone who has some experience and not someone who has no experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10748)|
| 2:59:15| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| I've got a strong concern about this adult business ordinance because the three adult businesses in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10758)|
| 2:59:27| two of them are for sure in my district and one of them is on the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| If it's in the fifth, it's right across the street from the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10771)|
| 2:59:36| It is in the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| So, I mean, this is something that's real important to the people in my district that these regulations be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10778)|
| 2:59:47| Honestly, I wish we could do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| I wish we could go ahead and appoint Mr. Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| and then if we decide to make this a commission appointment and go through the procedures to appointing either Mr. Anderson or someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10792)|
| 3:00:02| I'd like to do that because I want somebody on the job ready to hear these complaints as soon as this goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10802)|
| 3:00:11| Is there any way that we can do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| Is there any way that we can go ahead and appoint Mr. Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| and then either reappoint him or see if he'll work pro bono?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10816)|
| 3:00:23| Because I don't want us to skip a beat on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| Well, the appointment is only for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| And we could always go back and change the ordinance or have a new appointee if in a year's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10830)|
| 3:00:38| I don't know how many of these cases will even be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| I mean, you can structure the resolution or the ordinance any way you please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10844)|
| 3:00:49| You could make, you can go along with the approved resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10849)|
| 3:00:54| You could change the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| You could amend it to make it a three-month term and see how that works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10856)|
| 3:01:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| I'd like to make the counter motion, alternative motion, that we appoint Mr. Anderson for a six-month period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10864)|
| 3:01:12| and then at that point we revisit it and consider making this a commission appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10872)|
| 3:01:17| I mean, I just do not want us to skip a beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| I want there to be someone ready to hear these cases as soon as the complaints come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10879)|
| 3:01:25| because I assure you complaints are going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| These citizens for years have waited for this ordinance to be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10888)|
| 3:01:36| I will second Commissioner Lambert's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10898)|
| 3:01:39| Let me ask you this, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10899)|
| 3:01:40| If we get a complaint in and Mr. Anderson, if he gets appointed, let's not fool the people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10900)|
| 3:01:48| They're not going to go out there and padlock the doors the first time they get a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| They're going to have a hearing and they're probably going to appeal as they have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10912)|
| 3:01:57| How long have we been dealing with this to get it into federal court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10917)|
| 3:02:02| This body passed the ordinance back in 2005, and it was amended again that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10922)|
| 3:02:09| It's been in federal court for a couple of years now, pending consideration by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10929)|
| 3:02:15| The federal court in December determined that our ordinance was in fact constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10935)|
| 3:02:22| It is valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10942)|
| 3:02:23| And so we're proceeding to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10943)|
| 3:02:26| We've been asked by the plaintiff's attorneys not to enforce it, but we've respectfully declined their offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10946)|
| 3:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10953)|
| 3:02:34| You know, so saying that, you know, as the catchphrase has been all year, what's the hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10954)|
| 3:02:40| What's the hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10960)|
| 3:02:41| Why don't we get it right the first time, get us an attorney who knows the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| We don't let people build our schools or do bridge work that has no experience in bridge work or building schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10966)|
| 3:02:55| So I think we owe it to the citizens to see if we can get somebody pro bono,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| because I don't think it's going to be an everyday job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| It may be one time a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10981)|
| 3:03:04| So that's, I'll have to vote against the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10984)|
| 3:03:08| I assume that's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10988)|
| 3:03:09| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| Mayor, let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10993)|
| 3:03:19| Mayor, did, and I don't know, you may have said I did not catch, have you asked Mr. Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=10999)|
| 3:03:25| have you talked to him, whether he would serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11005)|
| 3:03:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11008)|
| 3:03:29| And he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11009)|
| 3:03:30| Yes, he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11010)|
| 3:03:31| You know, Commissioner Lemon, you know, I'm inclined to believe what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11011)|
| 3:03:34| I don't care to, you know, try it for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| But, you know, I think let's try it for six months and leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| And if that doesn't work, let them appoint somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11019)|
| 3:03:42| We're just asking more work of us too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11022)|
| 3:03:46| And like Commissioner Hammond said, we're the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11026)|
| 3:03:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11033)|
| 3:03:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11034)|
| 3:03:55| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11035)|
| 3:03:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| I understand and sympathize with the chairman on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| but it's sort of a self-contradictory impulse to want someone who's made something an area of specialization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11042)|
| 3:04:09| perhaps even a career's work, and ask them to do it pro bono.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11049)|
| 3:04:13| I don't think you're going to find that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11053)|
| 3:04:16| And we have an individual with good credentials in law who's willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| Why don't we proceed, as Commissioner Lambert has suggested, six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| Let's try this out and see if we need to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| I think it's a very reasonable proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11065)|
| 3:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11069)|
| 3:04:30| Just to say that, since you directed it toward me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11070)|
| 3:04:33| is we have many qualified and professional people on our boards, library boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| health department boards that do a wonderful job, and they get paid nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11079)|
| 3:04:44| It's something they give back to this community because this community has helped them in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11084)|
| 3:04:48| And I know these attorneys around here probably have made good money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11088)|
| 3:04:52| So in return to put on the resume, doing something to help your community is a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11092)|
| 3:04:58| It's always a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11098)|
| 3:04:59| But when it's your area of expertise, you tend not to give it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| You tend to work on other items pro bono.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11101)|
| 3:05:04| It doesn't hurt to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| Commissioner Hartman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11106)|
| 3:05:07| I know I second Commissioner Moore's resolution, but also I know Bruce Anderson real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| He serves on the KUB board and does an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11112)|
| 3:05:16| I don't mind going for six months, and if it doesn't work out, we can go back and reevaluate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| But I think, you know, with a six-month period here, if we have a lot of requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11120)|
| 3:05:25| I don't think we'll have a lot of requests, but people think we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| But I think six months is enough time to find out if he can do the job or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11127)|
| 3:05:32| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part1?start=11132)|
