| 0:01:57| Thank you. Thank you. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| My name is Karen Harden. My address is, do you need an address to my home or to the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| The business would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Okay, 3434 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Okay. Sergeant Cowher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| We need your certificate of zoning and your health department building inspection and fire prevention approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| Right. I spoke with him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| We're waiting because they have to get a bigger grease trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| They have a 15,000 gallon. They need a 20,000 gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| So that's what we're waiting on for the tenants to get that grease trap in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| So she's still pricing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=160)|

| 0:02:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Will that have any bearing on their ability to open and serve if they're approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| They have to get that in order to get their final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| Right. You can approve subject to those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| And then we just wouldn't release the beer permit until they get all those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Ms. Harden, do you know what the time frame is for that to be completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| We've been working on it this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| We're waiting on two more people to give us a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Once we get a final last quote, she said it would be like three days to get it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=194)|

| 0:04:47| Jake Jensen representing Craft Axe Throwing at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| sorry, let me look up the address here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| 119 West 5th Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Sergeant Keller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| We need your certificate of zoning and approvals from health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| building inspection and fire prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| So just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Will there actually be axe throwing and beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| Valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| I expected that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| At Craft Axe Throwing we have five open locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| The nearest one to here is Greenville, South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| where I'm based out of and our team is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| We've had a great time enriching communities with this concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| but safety is our number one importance when doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| So we have nearly two years of experience on the longest open location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| So, again, safety, compliance with serving alcohol is definitely high on our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| So, yes, there are sharp objects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| but we do mitigate with our strict policies not only on the safety side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| but also the serving side with alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Sounds like an interesting concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| So I will approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=363)|

| 0:06:38| Bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| So I would like to disclose that I am a member of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| I will make the disclaimer that it is strictly volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| There's no compensation other than being able to do some good work with some very good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| So I will approve this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=418)|

| 0:07:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Let's have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| You can pick your permit up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| I'd like to ask if you would maybe just share a little bit about the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| I'd be glad to, briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| The event is November 22nd, and it is a benefit for Legacy Housing Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| We work with people who live in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| And it's a Cajun dance party, Cajun music, two bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| We'd love to have you come and visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=445)|

| 0:07:32| but since you all know your way around, the ramp construction shouldn't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| So we'd love to see you there, and thank you for the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=457)|

| 0:08:12| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| We need your certificate of zoning, your health department building inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=494)|

| 0:08:50| at 111 State Street in the Old City 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Sergeant Caller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| We need your certificate of zoning, health department approval, building inspection approval, and fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=549)|

| 0:09:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Could I ask you guys to maybe tell us a little bit about the venue and what you'll be doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| River and Rail Theater Company is a non-profit professional theater company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| and one of the biggest challenges in our existence has been a venue to perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| Performing arts companies really need venues weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| We perform for two, three weeks at a time, similar with dance companies and opera companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| and most of the venues downtown really operate on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| Folks like the Standard and the Mill & Mine are really available on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| So our company and our board has purchased a building located in the heart of the Old City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| and we're turning it into the Old City Performing Arts Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| It will not only be our home as our theater company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| but it will also be a venue that's available for other local performing arts companies to rent with a focus on performing arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=616)|

| 0:12:40| Is that what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| We haven't actually withdrawn, but there's evidence I think that it's closed and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| had no contact from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| There was a sign posted on the front door that read the restaurant is permanently closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| when I posted the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=774)|

| 0:13:09| This one was one that we previously granted a 30-day postponement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| And since we have some evidence that they're no longer open, I'd say we just don't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=798)|

| 0:13:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=804)|

| 0:13:49| I am looking for a 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Think that's enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Just trying to be easy on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| We can get 120 if you want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| 120?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| You got two holidays coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Yeah, maybe 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| But could we open before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| If you're ready before then, you'll be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| I'll be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| You'll just have to come back in 120 days if you're not finished and give an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Yes, if I can go with 120, I'll go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| And the next beer board chair may not be as nice as I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| He might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Or she.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Or she.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| I mean, the odds are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| The odds are pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| We digress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| We better keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| He's asking for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Who would like to make a motion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| I'll make that motion to extend for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=884)|

| 0:14:49| So 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Let's see if it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Oak Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| They picked up their permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Oh, bless them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Man, look at all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| I love people like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| I feel like they ought to get a prize or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| The Gathering Spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| Well, that's not a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| Any update on the Gathering Spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Mark spoke with her earlier in the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| and communicated with her that she needed to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| but I don't see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| You want to postpone it for 30 days and see if they come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| So have they received anything in the mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| or was just the phone conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Yeah, I didn't mail it since I spoke to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| before they were going to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Terry Cade, one of the owners, is the person I spoke with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| And I know Ms. Cade's residence is, her primary residence is in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| Did she indicate that she would be in town and available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| At that time she did, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| I mean, she didn't indicate specifically that she wouldn't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| She asked about the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| she was on top of the need for an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| and aware that their previous extension was expiring this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| I expected to see her, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Okay, we can give it a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| I'll move to approve a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| So 30 days, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Can you notify them, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| Yes, I definitely will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| They've got to show up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Or otherwise they're going to get denied and they're going to have to start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| We don't want that if we can help it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| One administrative hearing, Amigos Tequila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Is that what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| My name's Elise Heunava,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| My address is 4824 Harvest Mill Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1026)|
| 0:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| So this is December 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| You were cited for sale to a minor, which was your first in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| January 11, 2018, we received your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| We have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| 9-19-2019, you were cited again for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| That was the second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| 9-20-2019, you were given notice of an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| And then on October the 14th, we received your remedial plan and a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| So is there anything you'd like to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Or would you like to discuss your remedial plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Or tell us a little bit about what happened and why it's not going to happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| Or do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Well, that was like the server didn't check for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| And, like, we were trying to, like, train them better, and we got rid of the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| So we're trying to get, like, people that know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| So we're training them by watching videos, like having meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| and just, like, trying to have them, like, do their check IDs the way they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1103)|
| 0:18:34| Do you all check everybody no matter what age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Yeah, our policy says check IDs to everyone, always check IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| So we're making them sign the policy, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Before, we used to have it on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Now we have them sign the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Go ahead, Ms. Roderick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Well, I just was going to ask, in looking at the documentation for your remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| one of the things that you answered no to was that you don't do in-house compliance checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1142)|
| 0:19:10| in addition to those done by KBD or TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| Is that something that you would consider adding, where you would do your own compliance checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| Yeah, we're going to start doing that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| and, like, some incentive to make the servers, like, do what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| And your servers understand, or first let me ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| is it a policy that if there's a violation, the server is terminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| It's not on the policy, but we're going to, like, start doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| We're going to add it to the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| So that your servers will understand that if they serve a minor, they will be terminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| Yeah, they're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| And they will understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Some of the other violations we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| the birth dates are also required by the bartender that fills the drinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| so there's kind of a double-check step in addition to the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| We don't have a bartender, so the servers have to do the drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| So you don't have one designated person doing the drinks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| The servers actually pour in the beer and the margaritas, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| So you have here also in your remediation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| one of your last bullets is that they can scan the ID if in doubt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| There's so many applications, and we're, like, using the SafeServe app,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| so that, like, if you scan it, it will tell you their age, their name, and their address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| So it makes it easier on everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| So given the history, you may want to consider that as your double-check rather than when in doubt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I mean, we'd hate to, you know, see you have another incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| So something for you all to consider, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1265)|
| 0:21:14| Another citation could be detrimental, so that's why we're cautioning you to keep that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1274)|
| 0:21:22| A third citation in that two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Yeah, we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| You don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| That could happen, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| It could be very detrimental to your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Is that, like, an app on a phone, or is that something that you guys have at the bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| It's an app on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| So does it require your servers to have a phone that they could use that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Yes, and mostly everyone has an iPhone now, so there's no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| So it's not like you guys have a tablet or an iPhone that everyone could use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| We have a tablet, too, just in case they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| So they can scan it on a tablet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| It's a tablet for the restaurant, so they can use it, too, if they don't have the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| I know people that don't have iPhones or Android phones, and if you're going to make that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| because, again, we're cautioning you to not have a third thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| and if that's going to be a check you're going to put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| I wouldn't want that to be an accessibility issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| So with no further comments, we just accept your plan and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Make a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Make a motion to accept the remedial plan as submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| We're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Beer Board Resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Mr. Frost, do you have something you'd like to share with us tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| This is the application for the rare events where someone wants to, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| have a one-night party out in their parking lot and there are certain steps you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| go through and you're not allowed to take too much of your required parking and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Well, you know, it's a new form, it's been in place maybe 18 months and there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| maybe three or four of these that have been applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| There is a business that is wanting to have one of these events and they secured off-site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1402)|
| 0:23:31| parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| And what this does is, and in some circumstances you can have off-site parking if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| things in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| And this, the proposal adds a box that if the off-site parking, if the parking is off-site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| that it is reviewed by Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| It's nothing big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| So with a, you need a motion to put this on the next city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| A motion to approve the application form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| So, quick question before we get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| So this additional step would mean that a person would fill out another form and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| would have to go before Plans Review and Inspections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Well, they would have to submit information to Plans Review and Inspections that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| parking is off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| The form is currently on the books and the one before the beer board tonight, it's fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1473)|
| 0:24:42| from the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| It would be approval by Plans Review and Inspections of parking plan if the required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| parking is off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| And so what is the, what is the turnaround time on them to get approval or if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| a denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Well, for this, this type of permit you have, there's an extended period of time that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| have to turn it in, that's Mr. Byrd, do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Prior to the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Prior to the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| So, they have time to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| It's not an extra form, it's just an extra box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| So, I just want to, so would this also be, if we vote to implement this, would it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| listed on the website so people are aware of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| If you go to the city website and, you know, you can click apply for beer permits, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| there are links for the different types of beer permits that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| So, this actually is, makes it easier for people to have these types of event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| It's just making sure that they have secured parking, that it doesn't become a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| for the other businesses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Mr. Frost, so, a lot of the businesses in my district don't have enough parking already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1567)|
| 0:26:16| so their parking plan already includes off-site parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Would this also apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I guess I'm just, well, okay, so, it's a pretty normal thing in Fort Sanders and old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1580)|
| 0:26:28| severe neighborhoods, so this would only apply to the temporary permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| This does not apply to the permits related to pre-UT football games like along Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1594)|
| 0:26:44| Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| It doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| This is a different, a similar, but a different type of permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| Different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| This, you know, an example would be a restaurant wanting a Cinco de Mayo event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| They're allowed, but let's pretend, for sake of argument, that they have very little parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| Well, this allows them to get their required parking elsewhere for this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Actually, so, I'm in favor of this because it's been an ongoing issue in some of my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| So, I appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I think businesses need to think about how their parking situation affects the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| businesses when they're having special events, so, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| More?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| You got more, Gwen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| No more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| That's not going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| We can't vote if you turn your line off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1660)|

| 0:27:42| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293191022?start=1662)|
