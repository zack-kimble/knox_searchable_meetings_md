| 0:01:00| I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=60)|

| 0:01:51| On behalf of the Board and as graduations have all been wrapped up, I just want to congratulate our Class of 2022 and wish all of our 2022 graduates a bright future and much success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=111)|

| 0:02:12| Finally, I wanted to take just a moment to welcome Dr. Roswick to his first official meeting as Superintendent of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| How was your first day of school, Dr. Roswick? Was it good? Would you like to say something about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| That was great. Thank you, Ms. Christie. No, it was great. I mean, this is a dream come true and it's nice to finally have the day to be here and I thank the Board for this opportunity to be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=144)|
| 0:02:36| You know, for me, I was able to spend my very first hours at schools. So I went to three of our schools to see summer learning today and saw some kids learning and engaged and teachers doing an incredible job with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=156)|
| 0:02:49| And so it was it was a great way to start the day. But I appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| Thank you. And are there any requested changes to the meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| So we have a motion to approve by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Satterfield. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=180)|
| 0:03:12| So we do have a special recognition tonight of our student representative, Mr. Raymond Jin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=192)|
| 0:03:21| This June's the last month, I guess, for you, right? And Ms. Satterfield has a few words to say, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=201)|
| 0:03:30| Yes. Thank you, Chair. Thank you for letting me share some more about Raymond, because I was the one that was the student, the board rep of the student committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=210)|
| 0:03:41| So I got to see Raymond go through the process and rise to the top. So since June will be the last month of his term, the board and the superintendent wanted to take this opportunity to recognize our current Board of Education student representative Raymond Jin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=221)|
| 0:03:55| Raymond Jin has been a joy to work with and was dedicated and was dedicated to attending not only board meetings, but student advisory councils and student government meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=235)|
| 0:04:04| Thank you for your hard work and specifically the hard work that you put into getting the superintendent search input with the students. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| A few highlights about Raymond are that he graduated from Fairgate High School as valedictorian on May 22nd with a four point seven eight weighted GPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| During his senior year, he served as the Mu Alpha Theta president, the Tennessee Mu Alpha Theta treasurer and the secretary of science club organizing science bowls invitation competition for over 50 students and mentoring new science Olympia team members at Fairgate High School and middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=261)|
| 0:04:39| Raymond also served as the secretary of model for United Nation and is a participant of the Alliance for Education Equity Steering Committee from 2019 to 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| He also serves as a junior state junior state of America secretary. You're busy, Raymond. Whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| In addition to the valedictorian, Raymond is a 2022 U.S. presidential scholar semifinalist and a 2022 National Merit finalist. He won the Best Speaker Award for 2022 Junior State of America Spring State and the Best Delegate Secretary Security Council for the 2021 Southeastern Model U.N. Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=295)|
| 0:05:17| Raymond also took first place as a member of the Fairgate High School 18 in the 2022 Tennessee Science Bowl and first place in the Wi-Fi lab and fifth place in the astronomy in the 2022 Tennessee State Science Olympia. Whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=317)|
| 0:05:32| Every year we all agree how hard it is to say goodbye to our student representative and Raymond. You are no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| You will always be remembered for your commitment to this board and being an exceptional part of the extraordinary couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| Please join me as we congratulate Raymond for his service of the 2021 and 2022 Board of Education student representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=344)|
| 0:06:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=374)|
| 0:07:14| And Raymond, if you'd like to say something and tell us about your future and how you're just going to make Knox County just so proud of what you're about to go do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=434)|
| 0:07:32| Yes, thank you, Mr. First of all, I'd like to say thank you to all the board members for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| You know, this has been an incredible year that has flown by really quickly, but it's truly been an honor to serve this community with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| And this has been a great opportunity for me to learn so much about various things, particularly about this board and all that it does for our students futures and important role it plays in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=466)|
| 0:07:56| And so more than that, though, I'm also grateful that this board gives students a voice in their own education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| I think that's incredibly important. And I think, you know, this year, even though I didn't perhaps achieve all that maybe wanted to in this position, I really hope that future student representatives next year's grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=482)|
| 0:08:15| And then all the other ones after her will continue to carry out the work of raising lifting student voices on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| So and then this upcoming school year, I will be attending Yale University with a potential double major and environmental engineering and computer science and economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=502)|
| 0:08:31| So. So congratulations again, Mr. Chan, and thank you for serving on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=511)|
| 0:08:40| And I think you've accomplished quite a bit. So I would disagree with that. I think you've done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| And OK. And Dr. Ross, do you have a report now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| I do. Thank you, Madam Chair. Raymond, as I said to you earlier, go to Yale and get your degrees and and then come back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=533)|
| 0:09:03| All right. That's what we want. We appreciate you. We're very proud of you. So, Madam Chair, thank you very much for this chance to bring a superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| I just want to say again, thank you to everybody for this opportunity to serve as a superintendent. Very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| We have an incredible teachers in our schools, incredible students, and to be able to lead this part of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| It's truly a blessing for me. So I appreciate that. We just want to hit a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| First, I just want to congratulate the seniors, as Miss Christie has said, who graduated over the last three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| I know that it was definitely a challenging high school career for the seniors and lots of years of uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| But they really showed a lot of resilience just to come through and do incredible things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| And we're excited to see what they'll do in the future. And again, we hope they come back to Knox County or stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| It's very important for us for the future. A few other announcements. Our summer learning camp started last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| We have more than 5,100 students who are enrolled in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| As I said earlier, I was able to go to two elementary schools and a middle school today to see those in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| It was really the engagement of the students, especially around the stream programming and then in the early literacy that they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| It was great to be able to spend some time with them and to see them very engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| Our elementary summer camps will run through June 24th. Our middle school summer bridge will run through June 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| And then we also have 604 students who are signed up for our KCS ACT virtual academy that runs June 13th through July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| Registration is currently closed for that, but we're excited about the number of students who are going to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| It was great seeing the teachers and staff supporting that from the teaching assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| We have college students. We have a tutoring component of that now that are working with our teachers and doing that as well as interventions have been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=642)|
| 0:10:50| So hats off to those teachers who are coming in on summer and working. We appreciate what they're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| And then also we're grateful to the General Assembly for providing those dollars for us to be able to address some of the learning loss that happened during the COVID time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=656)|
| 0:11:06| Finally, for my side, I just want to say beginning tomorrow and in the coming weeks, we'll be announcing some shifts in our administrative structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| It's important to emphasize that the work of teaching and learning happens in our schools and classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| And so our goal is to realign some of the central office so that we can be more responsive to those needs in individual schools and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| So please stay tuned for those details. And again, very excited to get started. And thank you again for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| Thank you, Dr. Oswick. Dr. Murphy, we have an ESSER priority update tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=692)|
| 0:11:48| All right. Good afternoon, Madam Chair, Madam Vice Chair, board members and Superintendent Oswick. Good afternoon, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=708)|
| 0:12:03| My name is Dexter Murphy, director of ESSER programs. Today we're going to be sharing updates and highlighting updates from ESSER 3, priority 3, post high school readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=723)|
| 0:12:12| Unlike our reports from the previous this past spring, this trimester reports will have like abbreviated updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| So you should have received the presentation today, I think, that has an appendix that has more in-depth updates on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| But this is going to give us an opportunity to really highlight and spotlight some of our works, the powerful work that we're doing within the strategy today and moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| So today we have Dr. Keith Wilson, our director of career and technology education, and also Mr. Chris Tucker, our CTE specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| And they're going to be spotlighting two specific strategies from priority 3, post high school readiness, for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| Okay, just pulling us back to our vision for ESSER, I always like to go here, making sure we understand that Knox County is going to strategically use our ESSER funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| so that all students across all schools and all student groups will have access to continuous support and tools needed to thrive in grade level instruction to enable them for success post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=773)|
| 0:13:04| Here we have our reporting schedule. So we've made it through our first trimester, if you will, from February through May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| We started with post high school readiness, and in March we hit foundational academic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| April we went over overcoming obstacles to learning, and then in May we did effective educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| So now we're back up to cycle 2, if you will, highlighted in June there with post high school readiness there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| I also wanted to put this slide in here just to kind of pull us back to the allocation that have been provided to our district through the federal government through the ESSER funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=807)|
| 0:13:36| Just as a reminder, March 2020 there was $12.9 million allocated to our district, and December 2020 in ESSER 2 there was $50.8 million allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=816)|
| 0:13:46| and then in ESSER 3 there was $114.1 million allocated in ESSER 3 in March of last year, totaling $177.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=826)|
| 0:13:57| And I created this because I believe that while ESSER 3 is the largest ever one-time investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=837)|
| 0:14:06| I wanted to make sure I show this slide to show you the allocations across the years with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| So this slide shows our ESSER 1, 2, and 3 dollars broken out in a multi-year per student spending scenario, if you will, across the grant terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=851)|
| 0:14:19| So ESSER 1, which is in purple there under fiscal year 20, if we were to break out the $12.9 million over our KCS student population of roughly 60,000 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=859)|
| 0:14:31| it would equal $215 per student in school year 20 in comparison to $8,444 per student of our general purpose budget in school year 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=871)|
| 0:14:41| So as you can tell, it's a small percentage if we were to break and compare it to our general purpose budget there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| Looking at ESSER 2, which is in blue there, if we were to break out the $50.8 million over our KCS student population of roughly 60,000 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=885)|
| 0:14:54| it would equal $211 per student if spread out over the course of the entire grant in comparison to an average of $8,900 per student for our general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=894)|
| 0:15:04| And finally ESSER 3, you see the pattern there, if we were to break that out, it would be $634 over the course of the grant in comparison to the $8,900 with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| So in reality, the amount of money, while substantial, it is a relatively small percentage of what our district spends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| especially when stretched across the full ESSER grant period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| So this is great information for us to know enough for us to share to our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| so we can better understand the full funding story of ESSER and how it relates to our district budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| This is showing you just a small slither of what our district has granted us with the support for our students as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Okay, so this slide shows how the ESSER funding involves multiple challenging steps for school districts to navigate before these dollars are reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=937)|
| 0:15:46| and appropriated towards our school sites and to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| And the longest and most challenging stage, if you were to guess that, is procurement, as you can see there with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| So procuring resources with ESSER funds is a multi-step process that can play out over months, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| just months or half a year, up to a year in some situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| So we're primarily operating currently in the planning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| You can see there how the planning phase underneath that you have procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| So we're kind of in the planning, procurement, reporting cycle, if you will, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| So that's where we are with our reporting and with our work with ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| So I want just to show you guys where we are in that phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| It's a long process, so it's a lot of legislation that we have to go through, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| and then the allocation of the funds to our district, and then the planning process that we went through with our stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| and then also the planning process for us to decide where to put the money regarding the strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| and also the procurement phase of that that we're going through, and then finally the reporting out of the funds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| So hopefully that kind of clears up and gives you a clear visual of how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| Okay. You've seen this slide before, but just wanted to pull this back to us since it's the second trimester of this reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| I'll let you know that where the $114 million has been allocated based on our stakeholder feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| the $30 million in Priority 1, foundational academic skills, $19.7 in Priority 2, effective educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| $18 million allocated in Priority 3, post-high school readiness, $31 in Priority 4, overcoming obstacles to learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| and lastly, we have $15.3 million in other allocations and indirect costs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| And lastly, I want to show you this before I turn it over to Dr. Wilson and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| showing you the percentages of the breakdown in the gauges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| So we have 26.3% in the Priority 1, 17.3% in Priority 2, 15.8% in Priority 3, 27.2% in Priority 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1051)|
| 0:17:40| and then 13.3% in other allocations and indirect costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| So that shows you how we're allocating our dollars towards our specific priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| So now I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Wilson and he's going to walk through the strategies as just an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| and kind of spotlight two of our strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Next, I have a question real quick, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| Is it safe to say the effective teachers being 17% because this is a one-time lump sum money and it's not recruiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1082)|
| 0:18:11| Correct. Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| And that's what I want to just really highlight, that this is like one-time lump, so that's exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| And this is based on the stakeholder feedback where we did the feedback sessions last summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| where they thought the money should go as far as allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Thank you, Dr. Murphy, and thank you guys for giving us a few minutes to talk about our Priority 3 tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| And so just to start with this slide for a moment and highlight that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| I'm standing here as a representative of several folks and even people within their work that are working together on these action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1118)|
| 0:18:47| And so as we share some updates tonight, just know that it's representative of the work of several people within my department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| and then outside that department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| So you're going to get to hear from Chris Tucker who works with Gina Kirby on the site-based experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| and hear a little bit more about kind of the traction we've had with that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Our middle school career exploration is kind of headed up by our team of Christy Seals and J.D. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| Obviously, Jody Overton, who's our counseling specialist, is over the counseling and advisement piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| And then Danny Trant, Salee Reynolds, and Tommy Watson, our high school team that supports our secondary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| have been the ones really working on that credit recovery piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| So as you hear me talk about that, again, representative of the work and the time and effort that they've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| Since you heard from us last time, which was in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| So on that note, I'm going to share a few key outcomes from the work thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| Since you, again, have heard from us back in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| And the first couple of items on there are around the Academy High Schools model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| and the site-based experiences for work-based learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| We're going to do a little bit of a step-out strategy spotlight on both of those in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| So I'm going to kind of jump over those for now and pick up with the third bullet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| which is to implement consistent career awareness and exploration tools and resources for middle-grade students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| And so, as I mentioned back in February, this is one of those that's going to take probably a lot of planning on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| to make sure that we are procuring resources and establishing some connections with some curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| and pieces like that that can be brought back and used in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| And thinking, too, about the structures and the best fit for bringing that work back into work in our middle-grade classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| to really dive in a little deeper with some structured and consistent career awareness and exploration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| And so to highlight some, I guess, work that's happened in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| as Dexter mentioned, procurement is a big piece of that puzzle when you're trying to establish this work and the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| And so we've had to put out a couple of different requests for proposal RFPs for college and career awareness services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| which is really everything from supporting career events to providing some curriculum pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| to online resources, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| So we've put a couple of those out, and we actually have closed one of those bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| and are in the review process right now in terms of moving towards being able to purchase those resources for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| And then we had another one that we're actually going to be able to tack on to an existing contract that another district had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| which actually makes the procurement process much faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| So that was for another service, another software platform we were looking at to utilize, and so that's been set up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Chrissy and Dr. Faulkner, I should say Dr. Seals and Dr. Faulkner, both recent graduates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| have been working with some smaller teams of leaders from our middle schools and elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| and kind of trying to target those feeder patterns that are lining up with some of our Ford Academy high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| Again, thinking more strategically about how we're building that pathway into the high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| and into some of the new structures that we're building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| And so they've established with our elementary steering committee a 5th grade focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| really looking at that last year and that transition into 6th grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| and what kind of activities do we want to build into the 5th grade year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| And then looking across 6th, 7th, and 8th at what a buildout of, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| sort of standardized exposure awareness activities would look like in the realm of career exploration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| They've begun that work really with the middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| First with sharing some of these career milestone benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| What is it we expect students to experience while they're in middle school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| And then we've actually just recently had something that I think will end up being beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| which is the state of Tennessee has now identified and kind of developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| and the state school board just approved a sequence of courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| that can be offered through the related arts in the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| And so there's a 6th, 7th, and 8th grade progression for career awareness exploration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| and then even pathway planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| And so, again, one of the hard things you may have heard me talk about before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| when it comes to this work is sort of where is it housed in the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| Who teaches this? Where does it live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| And so having some structured courses around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| and expanding what schools can offer through their related arts wheel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| is a great opportunity to, as we think about getting these resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| and thinking about the work, where do we plug it back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| So that's a good opportunity that should be forthcoming on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| The strategy 3Ds, which we call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| implementing a system for creating and tracking a focused plan of study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| for high school students really comes back into counseling and advisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| How are we providing that structured advisement, that structured planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| for students as they move through the high school experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| And we really began that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| This was one of those places where we were looking at some positions to help do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| And the first of those two positions, or first of the positions we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| were two to support our counseling department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| and having some more supervision and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| So we've hired a lead college and career counselor for middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| and one also for high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| And those folks came on board back in mid-April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| And they're just really going to allow our counseling specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| to have some additional feet to go out and work with our counselors on this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| and expand that department support a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| And then we have hiring underway, if you recall, back in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| for the college and career support positions that we were going to put into the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| And originally we advertised those and were thinking through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| as college and career counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| What we ended up actually creating were three different job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| so that the schools had some leeway to really decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| if you're going to get this resource, what's the best way for you to use that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| And it could be hiring a counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| It could be hiring a college and career teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| like in the case of a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| We're talking about these courses that we could build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| You could actually have someone whose job was to go in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| and provide some of the structured support and lessons on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| We also even had a classified or non-certified role that could be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| that would allow people to have sort of a college and career mentor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| that could work with students and do some type of pathway planning and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| And so we did that sort of by setting for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| We're going to inject some resources into this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| of counseling and advisement that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| What's the best way you could utilize those resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| to either start providing services for students in a way that you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| or become more efficient at that by using these positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And so we're about 60 percent hired right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| It's a little hard for me because I don't control those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| to get the exact number at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| But we were somewhere between 13 and 15 positions still posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| with schools looking to hire those currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| And last update for that particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| We have had in the past or in the past have used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| an online tracking platform called SCUDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| which is a way for counselors to document and track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| sort of what their day is spent on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| how much of their time is spent on certain activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| And it really gives you an opportunity if used well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| to have some data to make decisions on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| about places you need to enrich your services you're offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| or how to analyze how time is being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| It can help counselors advocate for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| in terms of where their time is being spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| and in terms of things that they may want to take off their plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| And so we're expanding the use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| And so the last piece on that is the procurement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| rolling forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| And on that, I think the sole source got finished up today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| for that SCUDA platform to expand the use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| So that's another piece in terms of this whole advisement part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| that we want to highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| And then the last one would be the tiered support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| for students earning and recovering credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| This is really, you know, we talked about this priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| is the big picture of it, post high school readiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| really is in that strategic goal we have around ready graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| And so how do we ensure kids are on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| and graduating in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| You know, so much of that is tied back in ensuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| that they earn those credits and don't get too far behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| And so there's multiple ways that that work has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| and is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| In the spring semester, back when I talked to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| in February, we were just wrapping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| the January Blitz, which we had some closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| and then it ended up being part of February Blitz as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| And we ended up having 539 students that participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| in that back in the January-February window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| and 442 credits that students recovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| through that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| And if you recall, when we talk about this credit recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| through the Blitz program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| it really is this kind of standards-based approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| If students have gotten, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| let's say a 50-60 average in that class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| and they've shown that they've mastered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| some of those standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| it's an opportunity for the teacher to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| work with them, really in a tailored way to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| if we can show some evidence and we can go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| and do some work in these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| we can recover that credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| And it's very important for getting kids back on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| if they've missed out on that first go-around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| During this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| we have a couple of different things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| One is a summer recovery credit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| We've got 43 staff and 1,000-plus students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Participating in that summer recovery program right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| And our goal for that is that 95%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| of the participating students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| are going to recover at least one credit through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| I believe, and I didn't put that in my notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| but I believe that's happening at all of our high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| with the exception of Paul Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| because that's really the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| that they are in anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| And then last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| we mentioned the summer learning camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| and summer bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| We have summer bridge for our middle school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| but we also have it for that transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| into high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| And so for those 8th to 9th grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| those rising 9th graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| that were targeted as maybe needing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| a little bit more acceleration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| or kind of some onboarding support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| in terms of moving into high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| and being academically ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| we have 10 different sites operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| and 377 students currently participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| in that 8 to 9 bridge program this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| So that's kind of catching you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| on the ones we're not going to spotlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Tucker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| to talk a little bit about our site-based experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| and what we've been doing in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you, Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I am here before you to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| site-based experiences related to work-based learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| and career practicum courses across our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| As you can see, we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| a total of 14 different project submissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| from a conceptual phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| from five different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| We expect to continue to receive submissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| from schools that are not on this list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| throughout the course of the summer and fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| so that we can get those on our project plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Currently, these are all in concept phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| what we would call concept phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| because we've had no design things done on this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| Our initial budget for each of these schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| is $500,000 based on the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| that Dr. Murphy gave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| in this little slice of the pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Some of the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| that we've already received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| will consume all of those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| for the projects they've submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| and others will not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| So the expected project cost for each project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| will be a little more available to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| once the designs have been completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| by the design contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| You guys actually have a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| for that contract on this evening's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| I believe, that you'll vote on on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| So once that is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| we will start site visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| and the planning of all of that design work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| through our facilities team and those contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| We look forward to beginning that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Once those designs are done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| we will work with contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| that we already have on term big contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| through the facilities department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| after the state has approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| these facilities changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| That is a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| before we can begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| any kind of facilities changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| with this specific thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| So our goal was 50% of our high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| to have a completed project plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| by December of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| If these nine schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| have at least one thing approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| we should be hitting that target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| And these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| they could be a new implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| or an improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| or a renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| or a new practice in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| We have several school stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| that have been put on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| Many of those are renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| and we actually have a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| that are actually brand new school stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| So the difference in cost in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| can vary greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| With that, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| we should be seeing more of these come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| and those will be continually reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| through Dr. Murphy and Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Now we'll run through mine fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| So obviously we've had lots of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| happen around the 865 academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| and decided just to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| a quick update on that also tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| since it's a large priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| not only under ESSER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| but part of Dr. Reiswick's initiatives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| So we're excited to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| that we have officially hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| our seven academy coaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| which is a really crucial position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| when we think about this work moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| That is going to be a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| that's going to be a liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| with those community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| with our convening and connecting organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Right now that's working with KEF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| in the capacity that they've been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| to support us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| as well as the Knoxville Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| but really taking that load| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| off the plate of the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| and being that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| that can wake up every morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| thinking about those business partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| identifying the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| at the different academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Right now that will just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| helping us connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| and find those partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| that will help ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| that we have the types of experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| the types of guest speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| things like that coming into the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| I'm particularly excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| about the group that we've hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| because of the different experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| that they bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Again we wrote that job description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| to be one that could be classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| or certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| and the reason for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| or really even some of our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| that have worked through Project Grad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| through community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| through things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| that have had that piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| where they've really worked with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| and so when you look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| we ended up having a variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| of former educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| people that had been counselors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| and administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| people that had been just classroom teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| but we also hired a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| that had worked more in a classified role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| around college and career supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| They've been at Fulton High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| and it's going to shift roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| and be in that capacity there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| and so I think that the diverse experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| that this group brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| if we really work with them as a cohort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| they're going to help each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| really be a strong group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| at this work and at this job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| so I'm excited about those academy coaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| PD, professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| is a huge part of what has to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| to get this work going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| and we definitely want people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| that are almost complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| with our freshman seminar training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| and that freshman seminar course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| if you recall is one where students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| come in that freshman year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| and it's sort of that orientation experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| where they get lessons around college and career preparedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| kind of soft skills, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| They are oriented to that portrait of a graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| and understanding kind of what it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| to be a graduate in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| and the things that we're identifying as important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| That's where the youth science work is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| around personal kind of exploration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| and looking at interests and aptitudes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| and some research around careers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| and then also where they'll be introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| to the academies and the pathways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| that their school will offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| so that's important to that decision making point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| they'll have as they choose into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| 10th, 11th, 12th grade work that they'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| So we're almost done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| We've got a few little cleanup sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| June 8th and June 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Bearden had a larger team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| and so we had to give some multiple options for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| because we couldn't have so many subs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| at the end of the year to finish theirs out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| and hopefully we'll have some of the academy coaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| that were there for the initial training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| And then last, I thought this was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| just because of the way we're approaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| the work right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| If you look back into sort of our spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| of things we thought we would need to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| one of those was around the master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| which we spent a long time working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| and trying to refine and finalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| and that was the big kind of moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| for designation day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| and then now it's a matter of making that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| a useful tool, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| And so it's a big document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| You know, once they digest all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| and go do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| And so we're trying to move from that document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| to really thinking out 30, 60, 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| first semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| and come up with some implementation guides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| is what we're kind of calling them right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| that really narrow the focus for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| So it says to a principal or to a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| hey, in this first semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| these are the outcomes we're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| for adults in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Like what's happening with adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| in terms of this work as we roll it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| and what should we be seeing out of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| in second semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| And so really trying to simplify for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| sort of their focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| and not get too lost in all of the detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| and the things that they could get very busy in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| if not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| So that's something we're working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| sort of internally right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| and hoping to be able to offer to the teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| to the academy coaches, administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| as they're kicking off their fall semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| in terms of where to really focus their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| And I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| turn this back to Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| All right, thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| So this is just in closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| to show you a brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I guess donut graph if you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| of our progress with our action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| So within our action steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| within this specific priority 43| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| we have 72% of our action steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| 11.9% are complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| We have 6% with minor delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| and we have 9.5% that's not started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| So we're looking very good there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| within this specific priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| It is safe to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| and Dr. Wilson you correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| but it's safe to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| that this is kind of phase one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| if you will of this priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| So a lot of these things are complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| these action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| So they're beginning to move into phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| which will have new action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| So you may see some of these numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| the next time the next trimester reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| kind of go fluctuate if you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| because there's going to be new work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| to be done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| So this is phase one of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| and this is I like to call it a report card here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| So this is a report card for priority three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| They are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| 100% of the strategies are on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| with a criteria level of three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| and also the action steps completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| as you can see there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| 10 out of 84 are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| We have 61 out of 84 are on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| and we have five out of 84| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| that are with minor delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| and we have eight out of 84| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| that have not been started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| So some of the barriers and challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| are the procurement timelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| and just the staffing overall in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| across a lot of our priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| really if you will within ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| So we're looking good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| We're doing great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Hats off to Dr. Wilson and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| with what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| So just behind the scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| just seeing them meet weekly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| to monitor 84 action steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| is not something you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| that we should take lightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| and that concludes our report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| unless you guys have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| and just letting you guys know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| that July is priority one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| foundational academic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| Thank you Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Dr. Reis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Yes, thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Just to put this in perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| I know it's a lot that we go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| every month but just interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Wall Street Journal put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| something about a week ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| that of the $122 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| that the Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| gave out 93% of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| is still unspent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| and so just again kudos to Dr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| and to all the leads on those teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| the fact that we have a very detailed plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| a very good spin down plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I think it just speaks to the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| that we are monitoring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| we are reporting it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| that we're way ahead of the national curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| when it comes to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| so I just wanted to give again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| a public shout out to you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| so I appreciate that Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2379)|

| 0:39:43| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2383)|

| 0:39:47| I'm not sure exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| who I should ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| but I'll go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| In that first set of slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| where did you take them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| There was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| there was a percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| readiness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| for secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| 15.7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| 16.7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| Does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| 15.8 I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| does that include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| regular high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| It does include all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| within that 15.8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| within the post high school readiness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| It applies across all high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Now I guess my question would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| without identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| either the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| or the worst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| can you tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| what you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| the lowest was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| and what the highest was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| if you looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| individual schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I don't have that data in front of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| but I can get that to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| because it is in our SPIN plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| we have a detailed spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| that has that spelled out to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| but I can shoot that over to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| this afternoon if you want that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| and it does detail that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Well I'd just like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| in the next day or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I mean all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| this is great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| and I support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| in one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| or experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| one of those programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| the general public out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| doesn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| pay much attention to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| now this is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| but if we could show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| 20% or 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| that are graduating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| are ready for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| some post-secondary training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| a fact that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| that would stick with the average person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Dr. Oswin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| Alright thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| If I could follow up Mr. McMillan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| so just to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| and Dr. Murphy correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| I think that that's showing on that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| that 15.8% of the 114 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| are ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| post high school ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| so that's not saying that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| the percentage that are high school ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Exactly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| That's the 15.8% of the 114 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| That's about the allocation of the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| The allocation of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| But you do ask me a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| about the percentage of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| per school that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| ready graduates if you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| and that is a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| that we can get for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| I know that there are a couple ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| through ACT score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| through industry certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| or certain kinds of things that can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| but we can definitely get that data for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| but I assure you it's higher than that 15.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| Right that's just the allocated dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| so I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| just to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2603)|

| 0:43:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| So any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| So just ignore the lights Dr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| because apparently something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| So all hearts and minds are clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2632)|

| 0:44:55| basically the same as previous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| We're also increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| the fuel index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2704)|

| 0:45:07| for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| which is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| we had to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2709)|

| 0:45:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| five or six, six, okay, yeah, okay, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2758)|
| 0:46:28| The agreement is how CARD works, but the fiscal note says that it's an administrative debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| tool, so I'd like some clarification on what we're actually doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| CARD, I assume, would be much more calm than an administrative debt tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| I'll follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| So here's the administrative way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| That's the cost of the fees to use the CARD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| So the CARD currently, so the officers will purchase the required uniform, and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| will reimburse them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| What the pre-login CARD will do is put the dollar amount on there so they can get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| CARD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| So the actual $2,670 is actually just the fee to use the CARD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| The cost of the uniforms themselves are covered in the security package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| Okay, so item six or seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| Eight or nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| Ten or eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Twelve or thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Ms. Hohen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| I have some concerns with the pod list with NIDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| Looking at online for training, it's requiring two days of training for our teachers, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| I'm wondering if they are aware that they are going to have two additional days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| It also requires reporting throughout the school year, and I'm interested in how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2897)|
| 0:48:26| additional that's putting on our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| It seems like we keep putting more and more on their plates, and we're never taking anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| So if we are willing to put our teachers through this pilot, I want to know what they are getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| What do they get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| They're putting in two extra days and a lot of extra reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| I did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| Is that you, Dr. Ross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Thank you, Ms. Hohen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| I may actually ask Ms. Thompson if she might come up to speak to some of this, but I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| that the individual schools, this is a continuation of a program they've already begun, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| I think this is a continuation, and again, I'll let Ms. Thompson speak to it, but I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| they picked to do that, but I could be incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| We have expected them to do, so they've, it's my understanding the principals have talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| with their leadership team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| This is something that they're all aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| So they've already had two days of training, and this is a continuation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| They did this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| They did this last year, and I think the expectation is that they will have that again this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=2993)|
| 0:50:02| This was an optional program that they, as a school, they were, we offered this to several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| schools, and these were the ones that chose to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Do you have any feedback from the players at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| I mean, do we have any idea of how it's going, how they're using the data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3015)|
| 0:50:26| We've not asked that, other than they did want to, they asked to participate in it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| I can certainly get that information for you if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| If I could jump in, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| I'm not aware of each individual school's, but I do know, I was at Carnes Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| today, and Brent Glenn, their principal, actually took me into the counselor session, and, excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| me, offices, and showed me, they actually were recognized as a school of promise for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| their character education using this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| He talked about how they had embraced the community, and the student's art club had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| come up with the seven different pillars through the community, and they had those painted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| on their walls and in their cafeteria, and he was talking about how big an impact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| it was making, and I asked him, I said, was this the same from NIT, their character development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| He said, yeah, this is what that all came from, and that it had brought a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| again, as one of the schools, but I was there today, and he was telling me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| So, he said that they had beaver brags that they were doing from that, and they had, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| know, hanging all over the walls, and would bring kids up, and recognizing them for demonstrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| things like endurance, or empathy, or those kinds of things, and so that, he said it had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| actually been a big lift to his staff, and again, that's one of all the schools that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| are listed there, but I did witness that firsthand from Carnes Middle today when I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| That actually concerns me more, because this is a pilot, and what you described just now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3109)|
| 0:51:58| is something that we were given in early 2000, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| He, it was funny that he said, I mean, this program we were not doing early 2000, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| to your point, he said these things are things that have been done before, but that he felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| that the staff felt, and that he felt that, you know, everything's old is new again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| Things cycle through, but from NIT's side of bringing this care and care education in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| that they felt that that was strong again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| That's one school's account for what he said today, but he even said, you know, these aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| brand new ideas, but it was something that his staff had really clinged on to, so again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| I can give that one school's account based on what I saw today, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3160)|

| 0:53:18| is with UT becoming a literacy center, that Dr. Reed is one of the top people in the United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| States around that, so this is an option for us to bring in some other ideas for middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| school reading intervention that we've had, but I may have taken everything you're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| ready to say, Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, Dr. Resnick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| You just said it perfectly, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Dr. Reed has been hired as the director of the Center for Reading Research at the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| of Tennessee, which is in establishment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| It's in the process of being established, I guess, and this is a federal grant that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| she has in her previous institution and would like to bring it with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| We are under no obligation to continue with the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| It gives us the opportunity to do a very slow investigation of her process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| We're teaching particularly older students to read, middle school students who are struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| It's something she's been working on that teachers like better than they've liked other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| reading interventions in middle school, and so it will be a slow start if we're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| We can scale back at any time or we can accelerate at any time based on what the schools experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| through her onboarding with them and their possibility for continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| We're interested because we need additional ways to support particularly our older students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| who are struggling to read, and this has proven to be very effective in the sites where she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| delivering it, and most importantly, the teachers have really embraced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| They feel like it's much more connected to what they're doing in the classrooms and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| much more effective than what they've been doing, so that piqued our interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| So that's in her previous, where she was previously, that was the testimony from those teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| Okay, so will this be open to, how is it going to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| Will this be open to a handful of schools initially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| So I think what we'll probably do is have a meeting with schools and let them know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| this possibility and gauge interest from there, and she's only interested in starting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| sixth grade to begin with, so it would be identifying which sixth grades in our middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| schools are interested in that pilot, and then also looking at what we have the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Yes, and Susan, I just want to let you know, I had the opportunity, my interns had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| opportunity to sit under Dr. Reed's, one of her trainings, and the reviews, I wasn't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| but the reviews from the interns and their college students on how to implement reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| and they're not teachers, was very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| So I think that her program, I didn't go to it myself, but my college student interns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| really enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| So moving on in contracts, items 14 or 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3370)|
| 0:56:20| 16 or 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| 18 or 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3387)|
| 0:56:36| So board policies A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3396)|
| 0:56:44| Ms. Elwood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| The reason for rescinding number B, A, B, which is B, 111, is because we're combining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3410)|
| 0:57:00| those in B-1-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Any other discussion or comments on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| Okay, board policies C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| E or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3439)|
| 0:57:50| We talked about whether to allow political organizations, whether to allow candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| My recollection was that we decided no on individuals, and I believe the language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| is attached to the agenda sort of leaves that vague and would allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| So I have some other language off to the side that I would like to suggest as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3488)|
| 0:58:19| Mr. McMillan, or did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| Since I was at the policy review, we've always allowed political candidates or parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3506)|
| 0:58:36| Why now have we decided to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| And it was, you know, as long as you went through the process, it was open to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| I think the question that came up was because it's really not an advantage to a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3528)|
| 0:58:56| because they can't have any signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| They can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| They can't pass out anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| So all they can do is meet and greet based on the law right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| They can't have any signage if they rent and it's after school hours or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| They can't have any signage if they rent and it's after school hours or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3560)|
| 0:59:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Well, we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| That's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Maybe we were in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| I think that's confusing to people because technically, yes, they could rent the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| but they couldn't do campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| They couldn't have signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| They couldn't hand out flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| So I think it will shore it up to just make it clear because now if they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3590)|
| 0:59:59| I think if I were a candidate in that situation, I would feel like I had wasted my money and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| to rent a space and then realize I can't really do what I needed to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| Well, we have political clubs that meet once a month at the various schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3612)|
| 1:00:21| Republican clubs, I don't know if that's doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| There's one that meets at Carter and one that meets at Carnes Middle in the library unless they've stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3626)|
| 1:00:36| But it sounds to me like, you know, that the people that object the strongest are the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3636)|
| 1:00:46| that don't really want to participate in politics in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| Now, I didn't have anything to do with them making this partisan as far as the way you ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| I know some people are really upset about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| But, you know, I wondered if that was a carry over, if that was a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| I think one of the issues when we discussed it at policy review was individual candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| Like let's say a sitting school board member decided to have a meet and greet at a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3675)|
| 1:01:23| Then that might give that school board member, maybe people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| because they were a school board member, might think that that school was endorsing that candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| And then we talked about the disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| I mean, if you can't hand out signs, you can't collect money, you can't campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| you can't have anything like that, if that was actually beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| And, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, board members, but I think at policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| we were talking more along the lines of individual parties having those events rather than clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3714)|
| 1:02:07| And I don't know, Ms. Morse, if you have…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| I can't say that the law department went through the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| And the reason that the initial language was in there about how individual activities like that might be disfavored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| is because the law is very clear that we have to be content neutral when we try to prohibit a type of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| And saying that an individual is not allowed but other political groups are still allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| could be viewed as inhibiting a particular viewpoint or a content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| It's legally more advisable to say it's disfavored as opposed to an outright ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| Particularly because we allow a wide variety of meetings to happen in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| I don't understand, just to follow what you said, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| if it were a sitting school board member and they had one opponent or, you know, more than one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3774)|
| 1:03:03| I would think that they could, you know, go through the process, rent the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| invite everybody that they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| And, you know, you'd have to be kind of a little offbeat, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| to think that the school was endorsing somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| Now, if they had a lot of friends that were on faculty at that given school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| you know, maybe that would give them somewhat of an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| But I still, I just don't see the point in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| You know, I just think it's more of this stuff that we're going through that is unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3819)|
| 1:03:52| I think the change to disadvise or whatever that language was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| I think that's confusing to the people who have to decide whether to approve something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| And I think it would be easier to either say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| That might violate the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| I think that might make it more likely for an individual to say, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| we're going to ban this particular type of meeting but not others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| It's just, it's a tricky scenario and, like, I understand that disfavored does sort of apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| sort of that sort of choice applies too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| but not allowed is a pretty clear standpoint for the school board to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| Well, not allowed is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| But I want to ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| I want, you know, what would, if anybody could go through the process and rent the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3876)|
| 1:04:46| and as long as everybody followed the same process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| what's so hard about that or so difficult or so unfair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| I didn't originally come up with the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| I was just working out the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| So when there has been a recent candidate who did have a main degree in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3900)|
| 1:05:07| and when that was questioned, my question was why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| Why would you have a main degree where you can't campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| and you can't give out signs and you can't do all of those things that are necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| Well, you can campaign, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| You can't campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| Not under current school board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| You can't get up and talk about I'm running for state rep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| or I'm running for commissioner or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| You can say just about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| You just can't have your giant sign that says vote for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| And this is what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| I think that's a community service more than a political thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| And again, everybody has the same opportunity if they choose to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| Now, you might have one where there are going to be 100 people show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| and their opponent might not be able to get but 10 or 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| That's where it might be a little embarrassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| And I think that's kind of where we're headed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| But you all do whatever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| I think the goal was more to make sure it was neutral and that we could have forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| and that we could have all candidates but not, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| I think it might make more sense, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| when the board member who recently had that come up at their school is here to speak to it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| because she was at policy review and did get some pushback as well because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| correct me if I'm wrong, but I do think that she had a lot of feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| and insight into how that kind of played out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| With all due respect, we've got tons of things that as a board we need to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4009)|
| 1:06:59| without getting involved in politics and elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4019)|
| 1:07:08| That's just the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| I don't think, yes, if you ban everything, that's one way of dealing with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| just ban everything, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| That's my opinion and we'll have to live with it if that's what your wishes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| I think the confusion from the staff is that we have policies and we have laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| that say they can't campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Well, maybe we ought to go back and look at those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| Well, that's what's been added here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| But when we look at just our use of facilities, it's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4057)|
| 1:07:45| And so looking to clear that up is where this came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| So that's not me bringing in that confusion over what we can and can't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| because we have policies that say, no, you can't campaign, you can't have signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| you can't do all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| And then we have the use policy that does not clarify any of that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| So maybe we need to sit this back and look at the language some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| Let me ask you this, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Do we still have religious groups or non-religious groups that rent the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| If you're asking me, I have no legal opinion on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| I believe we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| And our policy is that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Then they advocate something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| They may advocate Satan for all I know, but as long as they follow the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Campaign finance and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| It just overcomplicates the matters for politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| Ms. Horne, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| So, okay, going back to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| remind me, was this policy one that Gary brought to us that we needed to review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| Is that correct, Ms. Morris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| Yes, I think he inserted some proposed language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| and I could also easily say that he could combine the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| and include the additional language, which makes it clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| Yeah, so I think that's where it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| I think that's what brought on the conversation that we started at policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| So I think that a couple of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| and it sounds like we need to go back and review this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| but I think that a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| One, I don't think that the intention ever was to disqualify any group from meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| So if a Republican club or a Democrat club is meeting at a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| we didn't even talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| so I don't think that there was any sort of, you know, there was no intention to disqualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| I think that what we need to talk about is if it's allowable for candidates to hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4191)|
| 1:10:00| and also this also would not negate having a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| where you have several candidates being invited, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| I think the question really is if we are going to allow candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| I definitely see your point about everybody can go through the same process, certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| including sitting school board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| because you would have to as a sitting school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| you would need to go through the same process as somebody that is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| So that's really the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| So one more question to you, Amanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| Could, is it, it is not allowable under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| for a candidate to use a school facility and have their campaign materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| That is my understanding of a very complicated area of campaign finance law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| but that is what supports our board policies about those matters, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| So if a candidate wanted to quote-unquote rent a school building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| they can do that, but they can't have any of their campaign materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| Right, they can't have signs out front that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| school board candidate so-and-so, vote for so-and-so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| So we could still allow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| but it would have to be very clear that you cannot have any of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| which we, that's going to be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| And that's, I think that's part of it, Mr. McMillan, is that that's going to be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| Like if somebody rented our building, are they really going to adhere to the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| Would be, yeah, who monitors it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| So then is the school left, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| so I think that's kind of where you get into a sticky part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| Especially with administrators because they're not there to police it, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| and then someone complains, who's going to be, you know, blamed for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| or who ultimately would be responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| So I think that's part of what our conversation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| In the 2020 elections, there were plenty of judicial candidates, law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4319)|
| 1:12:13| and others that participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| They made all the rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| So I guess they were in violation, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| I have no legal opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| I didn't think you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| Are you saying that it's Mr. McMillan keeps turning the lock up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| I have an assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4358)|
| 1:12:46| Ms. Sullivan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| I think, let me, I do, I think I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| So Mr. McMillan, are you saying that the campaign, that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| when they were campaigning, they went to like the Republican Club meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| or whoever was meeting at a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| So I think that's what he was saying, that, you know, if a club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| if any sort of club is meeting in a, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| So that's, and that's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| I didn't realize any clubs met at school, so that's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| So, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| That's definitely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| If you follow through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| there will be some people upset about it in the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| How not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| They may be a very small minority and you can reign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| Well, but Mr. McMillan, we didn't realize that that was even a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| So that was not part of our discussion at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| when we talked about it at policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| So that does change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| And ask the WADA director to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| We can definitely send that one back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4438)|
| 1:14:18| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| I'll just talk loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| So are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| HRI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| So moving on to grants, A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4473)|
| 1:14:44| Miss Horn, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Where's your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| See, I can't tell because the lights aren't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| Oh, now mine came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| See, we just say it and it comes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| Miss Satterfield, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| So item C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| E or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| G or H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| Moving to item 10, contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| Item A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4531)|
| 1:15:39| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| E or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| I just have a quick question as to whether our officers currently wear body cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| or if this is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Our officers have had body cameras for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| I thought so, but I just thought I'd ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| Item G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| And moving to regular agenda items, item 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4583)|
| 1:16:30| Miss Satterfield, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| Thank you, Board Member Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| So just giving the Board an update of where we're at with everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| the last meeting that we had when we talked about the superintendent evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| we voted to have the search committee to own that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| And so I'm asking Terry to find a date for the search committee to convene in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| And with that, I've already received the evaluations from TSBA, our search firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| and I have some additional resources that I have on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| And if you all as board members want to send me anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| or send it through Terry of what you would like the search committee to evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| when it comes to the superintendent evaluation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| we'll also include previous evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| So the goal at the search committee is for the committee to discuss what this evaluation can look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| or should look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| And then my hope is to bring it back to the Board in July, and we all look at it and give feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| I would also like for us to vote on the superintendent evaluation come August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| just simply because the Board is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| And we were the ones that hired the superintendent, so I think we should just finish it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4664)|
| 1:17:51| Because for that reason and also on the flip side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| having new Board members come in, giving input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| and voting on something that they didn't have any process on could be a little unfair for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| But that's just my recommendation and suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| But the search committee will get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| We will recommend to the whole Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| So in between now and the meeting sometime in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| if there's Board members that want to see something in the superintendent evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| and want the committee to evaluate that, send it to Terry through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| But ultimately, it's the Board's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| We just want to consolidate through the search committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4707)|
| 1:18:35| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Items B or C, and I'll just speak briefly to these since they are both South Knoxville items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4717)|
| 1:18:49| Item B is for Coach Clark Duncan, and I will say that he has officially retired now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| And so I know that has been a discussion in the past that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| when we name something after someone, they have to be officially retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| And I will also tell you that the community has been asking for this ever since I joined the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| And it is something that Commissioner Daley and I both support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| And item C is kind of a cleanup from the former BMX project at Southville Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4758)|
| 1:19:27| Coach Stafford's name was on the original field that they were going to turn into a BMX facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4767)|
| 1:19:35| and the goal posts were removed, which tells the name of his sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| And part of that, when they were having those discussions and meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| pulled Mr. Stafford in and told him that when they rebranded it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| they would name the new fields and the lower fields both in his honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| And this is kind of more of a follow-up on that since, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| he does have the field but not really a prominent sign displayed anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| So that's what those two are about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| Questions? Okay. Public forum, Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| There's nobody on the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4822)|
| 1:20:40| I think that's the field house, right, Ms. Bales, I believe. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| I don't object to either one of these. I just think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Letters from community members that were sent in about this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4864)|
| 1:21:20| Thank you, Madam Chair. So I guess I'd just like to say two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| First, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| I hope that all of our students and staff are having a wonderful start to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| their summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| You all deserve a break after this long year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| So rest up and enjoy the great weather with your family and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| And I won't be here this next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| but I can't wait to see all the great things that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| And then the second is, although it's been two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| I kind of want to speak to what happened in Uvalde, Texas a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| I just wanted to offer my deepest condolences to the families and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| You have gone through so much more grief than anyone should ever have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| face in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| And I just want to say that our community and our school district is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| to support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| My hope is that action can be taken to prevent these tragedies from ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| happening again, because I can only imagine the anguish that would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| what would it be like if something like that happened here or anywhere else in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| the country? So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4931)|
| 1:22:22| Thank you. We'll see if this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| So, again, several have already congratulated our 2022 graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| And in addition to our, at Farragut High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220606?start=4948)|
