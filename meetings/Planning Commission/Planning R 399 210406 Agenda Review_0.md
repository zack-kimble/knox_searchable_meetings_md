| 0:02:03| And the 1st thing I just wanted to mention, there is an item on your on your agenda to the very end. It's a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=123)|

| 0:02:14| And it's for a couple of different things. So, Tennessee, we received a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| Tennessee department of transportation grant, it was recently awarded for a 2 year payment management system analysis that will be done in conjunction with local governments that are served by the actual transition plan organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=139)|

So we will send out a doodle poll this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=188)|

| 0:03:28| And finally, just a reminder that we are going to resume in person meetings in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=208)|

| 0:04:07| There is a requirement in the building to wear a mask and you will have, you will have Plexi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| On either side of you, and we will be able to separate you out further. If you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| If that's your preference, so we could, we could probably see people a seat apart and if everybody received a mask from the office, it would be nice. If everybody can wear the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=259)|
| 0:04:31| Planning mask instead of coming in with whatever if you don't have 1, I'm sure Amy can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=271)|

| 0:05:00| Amy, it was for the record. I look a lot older now than I did when I got my badge. You think I need to have my picture remade? You're welcome to come in and have your picture remade, but you know, this includes the workshop to the workshop will be, of course, on Tuesday and traditionally, I would assume it'll be the same. We will have lunch at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=300)|

| 0:05:38| Hello. Hey, this is this is Dick Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| I'm on the phone. I won't be on the zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Dick, we can hear you loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| Okay, good deal. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| See any other any other hands. Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and introduce Hanson Sale. I really appreciate him being able to join us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:06:07| It's got a great presentation for you all. Hanson is the government affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| And policy director for the Knoxville area Association of realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| Which represents about 5500 realtors in this area across 12 counties in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=375)|
| 0:06:24| Previously, Hanson was a research assistant at the Howard H. Baker, Jr. center for policy, providing research assistance for the center state and federal research portfolio, including work with the National Science Foundation, University of Tennessee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=384)|
| 0:06:35| Coronavirus 19 outbreak response experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| In 2019, he served as a research assistant for the White House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| White house's American workforce policy advisory board and former White House chief domestic economist. Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| Marianne want to make her Hanson graduated with honors from the University of Tennessee Knoxville and holds a bachelor's degree in economics with a focus in public policy and political science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=409)|
| 0:07:00| And so now I will turn it over to Mr sale. You should be able to share your screen. Yeah, let's see if we can. You're ready to desktop to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=420)|
| 0:07:12| Let's see, can you see my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| Let's see if we can put that in share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| Presentation great. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for inviting me and I'm glad to be here. And so we'll just go ahead and jump into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:35| So, this is just a report of sort of trying to give you an overview of what the housing market looked like in 2020. and so this is an executive summary. So, really record high home sales in 2020, much to our surprise in a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=455)|
| 0:07:53| This was not a typical recession, though. It did exacerbate our inventory issue. So that hit a record low in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=473)|
| 0:08:03| Of course, there's a substantial supply, demand and balance that I think we're all sort of aware of, but that has has been exacerbated this year as well higher demand than usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=483)|
| 0:08:17| And that's mostly a result of lower mortgage rates, but also some savings amongst the home buying community households at the upper end of income distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:30| We're not particularly affected comparatively, so lots of people staying at home, deferring vacations with some extra money and low mortgage rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:42| So, demand was up quite a bit and likewise, supply was down, but overall, it was a very strong year. The market fundamentals are very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=522)|
| 0:08:55| Supply shortage and affordability are certainly a concern, so we'll go ahead and move on. So, this is just some of the rundown of what it looks like we saw almost about half of the inventory is available from the start of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:09:14| So, there was a huge drop in inventory. Home sales, again, were up quite a bit. The median sale price grew by double digits in just 2020, and new listings were also down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:29| So, again, a really strong but peculiar year in Knoxville was also rated as the number 32 market for Realtor.com's top housing market list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:44| So, we are really performing quite well, though there are some issues on the supply side that should be concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=584)|
| 0:09:54| This graph just shows a historical perspective of what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| So, the housing supply, really, this goes back to 2008 and the decline in new construction and the ramp up in supply as we've recovered from the financial crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=599)|
| 0:10:16| So, you can see a huge years-long decline. But, you know, this is the part of it that this wasn't a typical recession. Even despite our inventory dropping so significantly, we are still seeing home sales well above the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:39| So, you can see this blue line here in 2021 is, in terms of volume, is still actually above 2020 and the previous three years. So, home sales volume-wise are still up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=639)|
| 0:10:56| However, I'm not sure that that is sustainable, given how compressed our inventory has become, especially in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:11:06| Another result of that supply-side issue, we have seen some pretty significant price growth, which is, on one hand, a good thing. We want to see those gains in home appreciation, but it has grown very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:26| So, you can see here in the last five years, the median sold price by year is up 46%. So, you know, that is a huge number in just five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=686)|
| 0:11:42| And, you know, a lot of homeowners have seen huge equity gains, but it has really cut into affordability, particularly on the lower end of the distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=702)|
| 0:11:56| And this is quite interesting, actually. So, the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors just recently fielded a scientific poll that was sort of looking at some of these housing-related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:12:08| And so, this was literally just fielded in March, from March 21st to 23rd, and more than one in three registered voters in Knox County said that housing affordability in the Knoxville area was a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=728)|
| 0:12:25| or fairly big problem. And one in four said the same about the availability of housing. So, that's a really interesting sort of real-time look at how voters and residents in Knox County are actually viewing these sort of market trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:46| And this next slide is an interesting graph. So, this is indexed. So, these are not made-up numbers, but they're just indexed so we can compare what the population growth versus the growth in housing units versus the growth in employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=766)|
| 0:13:07| Interestingly, we've seen housing units grow a little bit quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| than the population, but employment is actually growing a little bit faster. And I do think it's important to note that most of this data right here is not based on 2020, so it does not include 2020 data, which, you know, this year has been, we've seen a huge spur in new employment and job growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=794)|
| 0:13:40| So, that would likely be affected, but that's just to give you an idea of what those look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=820)|
| 0:13:49| Awesome. And so, this next one is going to show you that employment growth is outpacing new construction fairly significantly. And so, this is looking at, you know, just data in the Knoxville metro area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=829)|
| 0:14:04| And so, you can see that single-family permits are up and were up in 2019, but so is employment growth and a bit more than what we saw in new single-family permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=844)|
| 0:14:19| And something that I think is important to note here is that there is an asterisk by these numbers, in part because you can see the note down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=859)|
| 0:14:31| This does not account for employment growth in the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| So, recently, Morristown, Tennessee was listed as one of the top 30 under-built housing markets in the entire United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=877)|
| 0:14:49| And so, you can see Morristown has added an average of 600 jobs annually, while their building permits have increased by only 30 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=889)|
| 0:15:00| So, very under-built market. And so, some of these statistics, when we're looking just at the metro area, don't actually reflect accurately what the housing demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:14| So, a lot of the housing demand and new jobs added in Morristown is actually coming back into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=914)|
| 0:15:23| So, that exacerbates demand even above and beyond what some of our statistics will show us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| And so, this graph here is just a depiction of new construction trends. So, building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=931)|
| 0:15:39| You can see that permits have rebounded pretty significantly since the post-financial crisis years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:49| And that's a great thing, undoubtedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| We've seen a huge increase, especially in multifamily, new multifamily permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| But it's not quite enough in the sense that we are making up for about a 10-year under-supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=959)|
| 0:16:11| So, for quite a while, we have not been, because of 2008, have not been building at the rate that we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| So, you know, and there's still some pretty significant strains on home builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| The labor supply, building material shortages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| We were already sort of pre-pandemic having an issue with rising land costs and availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| So, all of those things have really been exacerbated and intensified in the pandemic year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=995)|
| 0:16:43| So, demographically, the population in the Knoxville metro area and in Knox County is projected to grow pretty significantly by 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1003)|
| 0:16:57| Above and beyond that, however, we have seen that Knoxville saw a rather large influx of new residents in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:17:08| So, above and beyond sort of what these projections, which are based on pre-2020 data, would reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1028)|
| 0:17:18| And there's a number of different reasons, and we'll get to a slide showing where I'm drawing that conclusion from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| And then next on the demographic side, GDP, this was a really weird year and a really weird recession in that GDP was down this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:37| But personal income was actually higher in 2020 and 2021 due to the federal relief measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1057)|
| 0:17:45| So, we're seeing households with a bit more income than they would have had in a previous year, despite being in a recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1065)|
| 0:17:54| So, both of these things combined, housing demand is going to rise significantly, especially for homes priced under $200,000, and that is currently where there is the least amount of inventory in the Knoxville market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1074)|
| 0:18:12| Another trend here that you can see, Knoxville was before this 2020 pandemic year was seeing a rise in the share of out-of-state homebuyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1092)|
| 0:18:25| So, this graph just shows the percentage of all homebuyers who were moving to Knoxville from out-of-state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| And you can see that has risen pretty significantly over the past five years, which is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| That means Knoxville is a great place to live, but that is showing that our population is rapidly growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1120)|
| 0:18:50| And to get back to sort of the 2020 trends, this graph here at the bottom shows that most of the population growth is not really—we're seeing strong existing population growth, but lots of domestic migration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1130)|
| 0:19:08| So, Knox County was in a minority of counties in the United States who saw positive migration from other counties within the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:19| And then in 2020, so above and beyond some of these preexisting trends, Knoxville was number 10 on Redfin's recent list of U.S. metros that saw the largest inflow of new residents in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1159)|
| 0:19:35| So, we don't yet have census data on that, but lots of—quite a few private data sources have indicated that we are seeing a pretty—a fairly substantial influx of new residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1175)|
| 0:19:51| And another one of those private data sources is that Tennessee claimed the number one spot on U-Haul's annual list of destination states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1191)|
| 0:20:00| Some more homeownership trends here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| Homeowners have seen huge equity gains, particularly in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| So, prices have grown about 9 percent every year for the last five years, like we just saw, more out-of-state buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| One thing I do always want to point out is that the Black homeownership rate in Knoxville is actually lower than the state and national average, and that gap is more than 35 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:32| So, there is a significant gap there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| But despite that, it is the next picture because the share of Black homebuyers in Knoxville has been growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1236)|
| 0:20:45| And then another point to make is that as the inventory is continually constrained, expect more households to be opting to rent and pushed out of the buyer's market just due to rising home prices and particularly as mortgage rates continue to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:21:05| This graph is a very interesting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| And on some of these slides, I'll move through pretty quickly just for the sake of time, but I have provided Amy with this presentation, so you guys are happy to have your own copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1267)|
| 0:21:21| But you can see someone who purchased — this is just an interesting graph — someone who purchased a median-priced home five years ago and has held on to it, on average, has seen over $100,000 in equity gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:37| In just five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| So, you know, very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| This graph here is just sort of breaking down the Knoxville metro population and looking at if you make this amount of money, what percentage of the inventory can you afford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:58| And so you can see in Knoxville, people who are making $50,000 can afford just 20% of the income — of the current inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1318)|
| 0:22:11| And so it's important here to — rising prices are certainly an issue, but the inventory — the affordability issue is really a result of inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1331)|
| 0:22:23| Inventory is skewed towards the upper end of the price distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| So with mortgage rates being so low, you know, purchasing the same home — it's more affordable to purchase a home now than it was a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1347)|
| 0:22:38| However, the options aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| So almost all of the current inventory that we have is in the upper end of that price distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1361)|
| 0:22:49| This here, again, is just showing racial breakdowns in the homeownership rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| You can see those gaps, and they are actually lower than the state and national average — the gap in the Black homeownership rate in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:23:06| And this next graph is just going to show you that the share of Black homebuyers in Knoxville is rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| So up from a low of 1.1% of homebuyers in 2016 to about 4.5% in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1394)|
| 0:23:24| And despite all this, we've seen pretty — the homeownership rate in Knoxville has been pretty stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| This data isn't the best data in the world, just because it's a granular measure with pretty large margins for error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1412)|
| 0:23:42| But it does show that it's hovered, you know, around 65% for quite a while now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1422)|
| 0:23:51| And then a quick update on the rental market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| New construction and multifamily is the fastest-growing segment of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:24:02| Lots of new — like, the multifamily building permits were higher in 2020 than any other year in the past two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1442)|
| 0:24:11| And the rental vacancy rate is projected to rise slightly in the near term as new supply enters the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:20| But that being said, both the homeowner and rental vacancy rates are very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| And this is just a really good predictor of housing demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| With vacancy rates are low, it's just a good indicator that we aren't supplying enough housing and that we need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1474)|
| 0:24:44| And these graphs here are showing you just indexing median rent and median family income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| So this is showing that the median rent in the city of Knoxville is growing much, much faster than the median family income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1493)|
| 0:25:02| And that's the same in Knox County. It's a bit less pronounced, but still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| A quick one-slide update on the commercial real estate market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Overall, the commercial real estate market has been fairly resilient in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| We've seen the vacancy rate hold pretty steady so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| The market is still constrained and is probably more suitable for owners and landlords than occupiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:34| But all things being considered, the outlook is cautiously optimistic for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| And so looking forward to sort of bring this all home, the challenge ahead is a housing shortage and not a bubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1541)|
| 0:25:50| I've heard a lot of, including realtors, mention a housing bubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| There's really not a lot of reason to suspect that a housing bubble is in our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| Most of the underlying fundamentals of this market are very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| We're still selling a huge percentage of our inventory each month, and demand is likely to stay high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| And will be bolstered by some Biden administration housing policies that are in the works, as well as strong employment growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1575)|
| 0:26:26| But that being said, the total volume of home sales are likely to fall from previous years in the latter half of this year, simply because there just is no inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:39| And so the big takeaway here is that meeting the rising demand for housing is really a critical issue for us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1599)|
| 0:26:48| Particularly for not so to remain affordable, but also to retain our ability to attract new talent and investment and be able to house our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1608)|
| 0:27:01| So that is an overview of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| There's some policy considerations that I won't go into that are more directed towards some of our county commissioners and city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:16| But I'm happy to discuss any of those if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| But that's what I have for you, and I am happy to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1640)|
| 0:27:28| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you, Hanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Commissioner...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Everyone's moving around on my screen for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Okay, so Commissioner Scott Smith has his hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Am I muted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| No, I'm on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Okay, I just wanted to say that was really an interesting presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| I enjoyed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Probably because it's about real estate, but also it was just a really good presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| But I guess what I go back to is, Hanson, you don't feel like we're in any kind of bubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| You feel like this is just the new normal for our community, that we are going to continue to have an influx of people and a strong rising value and rising price environment for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1686)|
| 0:28:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| I don't foresee that price...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| I think prices will continue to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| I do not think that they will rise as quickly as they did in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| I think that was a feature of a really odd time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| But as it relates to a bubble, we would have to see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| There would need to be a reason that we would see a decline in home prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| And I just don't think a decline is realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| And as far as the market goes, the structure of this market is very sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:29:03| We don't have the lending issues that we had in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| Most of this supply...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Supply and demand really dictates that this market is really strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| So I don't see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Especially in Knoxville where our market is just not as prone to the boom and bust cycle that you see nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1760)|
| 0:29:29| I just don't foresee that a housing bubble is something that we need to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| At least given what we know now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| Yeah, it makes me think in terms of planning that density is something we need to really get more comfortable with higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1778)|
| 0:29:46| To accommodate all these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| But thank you for your presentation. I enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Thank you, Hanson. That was an excellent presentation and very enlightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| One, how do we compare as a community versus similar size metro areas like Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| What are you seeing in other parts of the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Yeah, so the inventory issue is a national problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| The inventory nationally is at a historic low as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| Price growth in Knoxville has been much quicker and has grown much faster in Knoxville over the last five years than nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1824)|
| 0:30:35| Annual price growth in our metro, I think the five-year rate was 9.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| And I think nationally that same number was around 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| So almost double the annual price growth nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| And I would attribute that mostly to the fact that our housing supply is probably more constrained than it is in a lot of similar size metros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1853)|
| 0:31:05| Our housing supply is incredibly low right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| Our month supply, the rate at which we're selling, the percentage of our inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| We're selling almost 100% of our inventory every month, which you don't see that in a lot of cities our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1876)|
| 0:31:26| And I think that's just the result of we're seeing some pretty substantial employment growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| We've seen these two Amazon centers, technology companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| I mean, we're adding jobs rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| And that's only going to increase the constraints on the supply side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| And just given the nature of home building, you can't build a house in a week and put it on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| This is a long-term trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| And we have some supply side issues that we needed to make up for even before 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| So supply is probably more constrained in Knoxville than most places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| Are you seeing, do y'all track the prices per square foot for construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| We do not have very reliable data on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| I am working to improve our market reports and get access to that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1941)|
| 0:32:29| But a lot of that isn't publicly available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| So we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| But certainly I think lumber prices are about three times what they were this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1954)|
| 0:32:43| I think the two by four was $3, and today it's almost $9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| And rising land costs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| And that's one of the biggest issues that I see is that it's really not financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| It doesn't make a lot of financial sense for home builders to be building new homes below $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1979)|
| 0:33:09| just given the material costs and constraints that they're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| And so that's where I'm most concerned is that we don't have inventory at that bottom half of the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=1995)|
| 0:33:24| that we really need if we're going to continue to attract more jobs and continue to grow sustainably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2004)|
| 0:33:34| And so I think to Scott's point, I think density is certainly a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Commissioner Corbett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Yes, Hanson, a really wonderful presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| I look forward to reading it and studying on it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| It seems to me that the obvious reaction to your good information is that we need to have more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:34:03| That is, we need to just cram in more single family homes on small lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| and hope that the economy of scale will decrease the cost of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| But what we're running up against with that approach is turning our back on a presentation we had a month or two ago on public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2054)|
| 0:34:26| and the need that people have for opportunities to exercise through trails or playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| areas where people can meet to develop more community and socialization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| And so I'm asking you, and it's okay if you don't answer it right on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| Surely we can do better than just have a lot of small homes on small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| There should be some creative solutions to increase people who want to be able to buy a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| but still have some of the aesthetics that people look for in a good community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2100)|
| 0:35:08| Do you have any suggestions for a creative approach to constructing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| whether it be townhouses or conservation? I don't know. The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| Well, thank you for the question. I think that is a really interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| And when I refer to density, I'm not exclusively talking about the traditional detached single family dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2127)|
| 0:35:39| and putting as many homes per acre as possible. I don't think that's a sustainable way to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:48| And I agree. I think creative solutions are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| And when you look at some desirable cities and some bigger metros who have been able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| you know, relatively maintain affordability, you see a lot of alternative types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2159)|
| 0:36:07| So, you know, really have prioritized townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| And a lot of communities have been, you know, having conversations about a form based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| and the concept of missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| So, you know, in, say, Old North Knoxville, you have some of these beautiful homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| and, you know, developing a way that incentivizes someone to build a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| that looks exactly the same as all of these other single family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| but that is actually a duplex or a triplex that, you know, still allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| There's an agreement there that you have sort of a mini HOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| but you can still purchase a home that is part of a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| So I think it's looking at how we can integrate these sort of different types of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| that isn't exclusively single family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| And, you know, the important part of that is we have to be able to incentivize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| It doesn't just happen because we say we want it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| I think the big issue there is working to incentivize that type of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| that is a creative way to increase density in areas that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| And I wanted to follow up with one quick question. I know we're on a schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| My other concern is when we have developments that are sort of scattered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| through, say, Knox County, a more undeveloped or rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| I believe that the cost benefit is that after about 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| they're costing more in infrastructure maintenance than they're paying in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| And so in some ways, random development is going to bite us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| in about 20, 25 years with increased maintenance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| Does the Realtor Association, do they look into long-term costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| or just focus on development currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| No, I think we are very much and we're trying to reorient our focus in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| Infrastructure is probably one of the biggest issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| that doesn't get talked about in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| And some things might not immediately seem like they are cost-efficient solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:46| in the short term, but I think in the long term, smart infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| smart development does pay off in the long run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| and reaps rewards and increased property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| and increased property tax revenue, rather, is certainly one of our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Yes, thank you. I apologize, Hanson, I was not able to see your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| I got here just for the Q&A, so I will be doing my homework after this session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| One thing that you just said about incentivizing individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| to take different paths to build a duplex or triplex, like an Old North example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| I wanted to comment that not only is an incentive really required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| for those individuals to make that different choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| there are individuals who are interested in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| There are also educational components for the lending agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| that that is a good risk to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| Currently in Knoxville, that is not the attitude of lenders on that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| They tend to shy away from those and see them as too risky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| that the resale value won't be there because they're too different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| And so I think we've got work to do in terms of educating the lending realm as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| Yeah, I think that you nail that point. That's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| I think there's a one part of this is what I mean, you know, it is a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| You know, all the research shows that it's a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| But part of this whole conversation is also building the political will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| in our community and educating our community about how this sort of thing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| You know, there's lots of misnomers about how those sort of alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| types of housing affect surrounding property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| affect the property values of those structures themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| that, you know, we really just need to continue educating our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| And perhaps, you know, there be a specific camp educational initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| sort of centered around this, because I think this is one issue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| there's a lot of growth potential in Knoxville for creative solutions to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2471)|
| 0:41:20| Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| I think Commissioner Adams does bring up a very good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| and I'd like to just chime in really quick on the lending aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| You know, when you look at alternative forms of residential housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| you know, one of the first thing, the most important thing in lending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| with residential housing is the future marketability of that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| So a lender, I mean, they give some thought to how much it costs to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| They give some thought to maybe how much you could rent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| But really what they want to know is that everything goes bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| Who's going to buy this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| And do we have something else, you know, that has sold like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| you know, that we can compare it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| So I think when we're talking about educating the lending community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| the marketability, the future marketability of these alternative homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| would be the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| And maybe there's some concrete evidence of that in some other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| But just that's my two cents regarding the education of the lending community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| Yeah, I certainly agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| I mean, it's a tough one because I think this is a new concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| in a lot of communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| But I think there are some good examples of where it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| incredibly successful in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| And, you know, the obvious issue with that is that the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| I don't think it will work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| And, you know, that's someone's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| It's sometimes hard to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| But I think the best that we can do is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| build a concrete base of research data that is showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| how this has been successful in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| And, you know, beyond that, I think it's just going to take, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| a lot of support of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| You know, I agree, it's a really tough sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| But I think, you know, that's sort of the nature of the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| is that there's the same legacy in sort of the redlining, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2623)|
| 0:43:51| I mean, you know, people were unwilling to lend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| because they were worried about the potential impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| of Black homeownership in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| And we had to break that cycle and sort of say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| that shouldn't be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| And so this is in a similar vein, though a totally different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| But I totally, I absolutely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Thank you, Hanson, so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Okay, I think we have time for one more question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| and we could talk about this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| It's Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Oh, Commissioner Dent, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Yes, now we can, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| You can? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| I am calling in on my phone in addition to being on the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| so I'm just trying to test how this is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| No, you just muted yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Okay, so I just wanted to see between my phone and the computer how that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| Okay, so I just had a quick comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| I guess speaking from someone that I'm single.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| You know, I moved to Knoxville in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| I work at an architecture firm downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| So I make a decent amount of money, but I don't make a billion dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| And just, I just wanted to kind of like give a glimpse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| into what I've dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| So in 2015, living in Chattanooga, I had an apartment for $585,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| with like 800 square feet, one bedroom, water included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| Decent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| It was a nice apartment in Signal Mountain, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Moved here in 2017, found a one bedroom with like saltwater pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| storage, really good apartment in North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| like four-year-old apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| It was $685 with water included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| A year later, someone else bought the complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| and the price rose to $835 without water included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| And I started to wonder, well, I can technically afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| but I don't want to spend all of my disposable income on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| Should I consider purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Should I consider moving somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| So then looking at rent in 2018, going into 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| the same type of square footage or less for a one bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| is almost $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| That's wild, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| And so I ultimately decided to look for a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| I was hard pressed though, as you said, Hanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| to find a lot of options under, you know, $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| And ultimately I bought a condo in North Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| And that was where I could find a decent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| I don't mean, you know, the high finishes, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| but just a nice, decent home that doesn't require a complete overhaul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| And it was pretty difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| So I'm just kind of echoing the reality of what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| I think it's very spot on for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Yeah, thank you so much for that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| I think that's the crux of what I've been trying to get across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| in these presentations is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| we brand Knoxville as an affordable place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| and that it's slowly, but, you know, being less and less true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| I mean, we're still affordable, but it's getting worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| And so, you know, I think now is the time to act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| especially in a time where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| these trends are something that we have to tackle over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Again, thank you, Hanson, so much for this great presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| and for spurring all this great dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| I think we could talk about this probably for our full two hours for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| And I imagine that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| We will and should have some additional conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| about this as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| I know you all deal with these issues every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| So I will share out the presentation that Hanson gave today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| And I look forward to having some additional conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| with everybody about incentives and the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| and, you know, the tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| Talk about the tools we do have and the tools we do need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| to address the housing challenges that we have in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Awesome. Well, thank you so much for having me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| and any commissioners and Amy, of course, feel free to reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| if you have any additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| So we have quite a few agenda items to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| So if everyone's okay, we'll go ahead and dive in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| We're going to start off today with concepts, development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| special uses and use on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| So item number 30, which is for SF21C, it's Callahan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| This is a proposal for a new road for industrial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| And I'll turn it over to Mike if he's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| Yes. Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| I should be able to see my screen now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Let me know if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| I guess, you know, let's do our last presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| I guess this is one of our culprits of our housing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| This is a fairly large commercial industrial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| that's going to have lots of jobs in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| So we're going to need lots of houses for these new jobs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| But so this development is a warehouse distribution proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| The concept plan itself is really just for the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| coming into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| And the creation of the lots for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| So we're not necessarily considering the use here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| It's really the use as part of the traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| It gives us an idea of how many trips are going to be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| to the site and whether a traffic signal is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| And it's really what the traffic study has recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| a traffic signal at the new interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| So we're not necessarily considering the use here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| It's really the use as part of the traffic impact study is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| So the city of Knoxville, this part of Cal-An is a city road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| They do want to have that traffic signal warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| re-studied as they go through the permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| just to make sure that that signal is actually needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| And not just based on the assumptions of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| that they take now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| which is going to be a permanent process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| So we're not necessarily considering the use here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| It's really the use as part of the traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| So they're not just going to be under-counting because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| of the pandemic and then adding some kind of growth figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| They would like to really see some more concrete data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| just to verify that that traffic signal is warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| at this new intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| As you can see, this property, it's off of Cal-An Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| The I-75 Cal-An intersection is just to the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| And if I zoom in a little bit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| you'll see that the property has got several different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| zone districts on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Part of it's in the county, part of it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| For instance, this LI is the light industrial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Right next to that is a CH2, which is a highway commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| And then as we go back into the property, the AG zone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| So you'll see that there's a lot of CVs in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| CH1s in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| So you see it just kind of intermingles here in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| of city and county zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| For the concept plan, that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| We're talking about a road coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| A road can go over any zoned property as long as it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| an improved road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| But you will see a separate application or item later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| So you see that, just real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| when I show you the design, the new road will come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| from Callahan, kind of loop back into this AG property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| and kind of stop short of the hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| that you can see on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| The original plan was to extend the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| close part of Keck Road, and stop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| stop the road a little bit further back on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| And they were going to include this AG piece on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| south side, southwest side of Keck Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| as part of their concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Because of some issues with closing Keck Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| and the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| that's on the southwest side of Keck Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| they decided to just remove that for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| We may see that come back at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| But at this point, they really just need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| the road that comes into the site approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| If they ever decide to extend that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| they can bring that back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| for our review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Let me go to the plan real quick here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| So this is Callahan Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| the new intersection with Callahan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| that they're proposing and their new road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| that comes back onto the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| This doesn't show all the property lines, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| but it stops, like I said, short of Keck Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| I guess just to the east of Keck Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| that they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| So there's an existing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| to the west of them that's going to be impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| and they're working with the owner of that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| to make sure that everything works well together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| and is beneficial for all property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| An existing driveway connection to Callahan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| is going to have to be closed to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| They're going to add two driveway connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| to this new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| They're also going to have to work with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| across the street, which is a car sales lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| The current driveway comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| on the left side of the detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| or the west side of the detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| which would be offset with the new intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| So they're going to flip that driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| to the east side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| and just kind of readjust their detention basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| And I'll show you that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| So this is that detention basin I was just talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| and driveway for that car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| They're just going to flip it to the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| of that detention basin so that the new intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| should be right across the street from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| And this is the driveway on the adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| that's going to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| I just wanted to go over this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| because it is such a big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| According to the traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| there's going to be a total of 3,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| of warehousing and distribution at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| With zoning that they're wanting to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| which is for the city part that's zoned ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| they're requesting the IG industrial general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| We probably won't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| of the individual developments that come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| that's a permitted use in those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| So most likely we won't see anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| beyond the concept plan unless they need an approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| for additional disturbance in a hillside area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| or they decide to extend that road further at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Does anybody have any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Mike, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I'm just trying to get my bearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| I have not been to this case yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| And is this the intersection where there isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| this distribution center on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| and then the car dealership is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| it's a Honda dealership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| No, the Honda dealership is on the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| of the interstate, so this is on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| If you're familiar with the UPS distribution center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| So this will be right behind that UPS distribution center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| and their new road will be to the west of that distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| Mike, could you go back to the aerial that you showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| Is the median there on Callahan going to be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| and moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Yeah, it'll be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| So this existing median cut will be shifted to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| and they'll close a portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Mike, I'm assuming this whole thing is pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| a county highway department TDOT thing more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| I'm assuming everybody's on the same page with that design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| Yeah, I'm assuming everybody is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| So city engineering department will be mainly involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| TDOT did review the plans just because it's so close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| to their on ramps and off ramps for the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3394)|

| 1:01:51| we should keep the CG2 or 3, CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3711)|

| 1:03:45| drive-thru lane of scooters, coffee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| shop, which is the one on the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| closer to the Take 5 oil change, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| is the building on the right, move one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| of the circulation drive aisles to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| west side of scooters so that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| enter, they can either go into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| drive-thru lane of scooters, or they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| can go to the bypass lane and go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| So that's what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| So there's a couple of conditions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| staff has recommended that just need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| to be resolved during permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| So if you see the circulation lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| that goes behind scooters, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| stop here and you're going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| forward either to Winston Road or turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| here, they're on the same path as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| drive-thru lane on Winston Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| So they're basically head on here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| then they have to drive around a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| dumpster. So if they have somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| coming in, you have somebody going this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| way, they're basically on a head-on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| situation. Something that we've looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| at is potentially scooting scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| moving the scooters coffee shop forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| as well as potentially the Take 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| drive-thru lane. So that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| kind of thing we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| looking at during the permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| process. It's not going to change their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| site plan, and it's not going to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| any new issues with the drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| facility or the L-change facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| So the special use that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| be looking at is specifically for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| drive-thru facility. So drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| is a vehicle repair and service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| facility, and the L-change is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| technology zone, and auto vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| repair and service establishments are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| also a special use. So both of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| uses do need special use approval for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| one reason or another. The Take 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| L-change, their business is primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| oil change. They don't do much else in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| this location. There's really no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| other use for the L-change. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| the L-change seems to work much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| better now with this new layout than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| the previous layout. Anybody have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| » Mr. Korbelik? » Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| So if I was getting my oil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| change and I was exiting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| property, I would have to go over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| the west side of the property in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| front of the Scooter's coffee shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| and then circulate it around back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Winston Road. So this is a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| small site. So it's not like they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| should be pretty evident where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| need to go. It's not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| obvious where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| » I'm sorry. » I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| » I'm sorry. » I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| » I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| » I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4033)|

| 1:07:19| » I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| » If they don't exit on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| Kingston, they would drive around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| the property and exit on Winston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| » Yes. » And how is that made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| clear? Because you know people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| going to want to exit on Kingston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| » I think they're going to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| to exit on Kingston. » Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| » So you're just thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| making the drive aisle narrower in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| front and then maybe adding some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| kind of extra curbing around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| entrance potentially just to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| like force people to turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| the Scooters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| Yeah, that's definitely a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| turn on the Kingston Pike but obviously there's only so much you can do if somebody's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| wanting to do something they and they can drive on that on that surface over to it they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| they'll try no matter how much you try to design you know keep them from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| So as you said it's a it's a rather small site for all of the proposed uses. Thanks Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4109)|
| 1:08:40| Okay do I have any more hands up? So let's move on to item number 41. This is also Mike's. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4120)|
| 1:08:56| 4F21SU. It's Chris Sharp. He's requesting to remove a previously approved planned district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| designation from the property. So this is associated with a a concept plan that is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:12| postponed this month for 30 days but the the property was zoned RP1 before the new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4152)|
| 1:09:21| ordinance was took effect and that's why it has the this C designation for the previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| approved plan district. This property was initially zoned RN1 when it came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4168)|
| 1:09:38| the whenever the city's new zoning code went to effect they requested a a comparable zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| to their old zone and they did get approved the RN2. The property does have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| hillside protection on virtually the entire site and there is some there's definitely some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4189)|
| 1:09:58| significant topography on the property towards the back end of the site. It's relatively flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| on the front part of the site on the north side site but you can also see there's power line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| easements that come through this property. There's not much difference ultimately between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| what the RN2 zone allows and what the old RP1 zone would allow. The old RP1 had a density of up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4214)|
| 1:10:22| I want to say it was five billionths per acre. Yeah a lot up to five billionths per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| Their concept plan they have turned in I think it's I want to say it's 19 lots which is like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| two and a half billionths per acre maybe it's definitely less than the five billionths per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| So this request to remove the the previous plan district zoning is there's really not much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4238)|
| 1:10:47| difference between the old RP1 versus RN2 from what they're wanting to do standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| And with the with the removal of the old RP1 zone then the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| becomes regulatory as well. They've also submitted an application. One of the reasons why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| postponed this for 30 days is because they needed to submit an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| to request additional grading in the hillside area. So we'll discuss that one next month as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4271)|
| 1:11:21| But I just since this is a little bit more of a unique situation I wanted to just briefly go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| it and just make you aware what what the request is and if you have any questions about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| Yeah could I ask a question? What is what is our policy about in this kind of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| where you have a pre-existing plan like this that what are the criteria we use to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4300)|
| 1:11:48| if it's appropriate to remove that or not? In this case I couldn't find an actual development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| plan ever approved on this site so they have the RP1 zoning approved prior to 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| But they've never from I could tell that there was never an actual development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| even brought forward. So I think if this was a situation where there was a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| approved and there was some expectation of what was going to be there that would probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| something we would consider. Here there was really no plan ever approved so there's no expectation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| what would be on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| Okay thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4350)|
| 1:12:37| Thank you Mike. Does anybody have any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| about an item we haven't touched on that might be a special use use on review concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4361)|
| 1:12:49| before we move to resettings and plan amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| Okay I see no hands. All right thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Okay so we'll move on to agenda items five and six. I will not read out well actually we're gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| that one I think is still on your agenda but they will be requesting a three-month postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| to allow for more time to meet with the neighborhood. So I'm I'm going to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| that we hold off on discussing that item if everyone's okay with that until it reappears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| on our you will have to vote on this on Thursday but we can talk about it in a few months if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| okay. Okay I don't see any objections. All right so agenda item number eight is 3D21RZ3A21SP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4407)|
| 1:13:36| Benjamin Mullins. We've all received a lot of correspondence about this one this is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| on Bexhill Drive. Turn it over to Michelle. She is ready. Thank you Amy. So yes this is a request to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4421)|
| 1:13:54| rezone this property from a combination of zoning to a commercial zone. So the land use right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| surrounding it is mostly single family though there are a little bit of a mix of uses across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| the street. Bluegrass Elementary is right here just to kind of orient everyone. So the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4445)|
| 1:14:13| became PC in 1976 that was prior to the sector plans being adopted as part of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4453)|
| 1:14:22| through here. The interesting thing about this one you know the actually the I've got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4462)|
| 1:14:31| clip from the staff report. So the staff recommendation from 1976 they acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| that this area is rapidly growing population and that oops sorry the population is rapidly growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4478)|
| 1:14:47| and that that that growth of population would cause a demand for commercial goods and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| and so it recommended it at this property to provide that to the residents. It also talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| about the site encouraging development rather than strip. So it wanted a center type development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| rather than strip commercial and then it also talked about the property on the north and south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| side serving as buffers because it's owned as the same person. So that was the initial intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| We don't have an aerial from 1976 but in 69 you can see it was pretty much just open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4513)|
| 1:15:20| The property to the south was being developed and in 85 all of these houses were there. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| property to the north and south that was supposed to be the buffer. I assume would have been this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| property here and this property here because the roadways had been approved already. So just kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4529)|
| 1:15:37| of going back up again you might already be familiar with this area but this is the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| parkland right through here. The blue grass is down that way and just another view on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4542)|
| 1:15:50| and then kind of bird's eye view of the property. Again single family housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| all the way around and then you know typically we like to have some commercial properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4555)|
| 1:16:02| are available to serve these residents in this area so they don't have to drive too far. In 1976| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| that was the recommendation for this as I was saying earlier but these properties down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| along south north shore hadn't been developed yet. So now there is a commercial node that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| able to serve this property to the south and then there's also another one slightly to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| This is the property here at Bexhill. This one is being built right now and then of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| Cedar Bluff is further up here and there's a plethora of commercial choices in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| However I say that this one was a little bit challenging to deal with because obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| Ebenezer is an arterial and would be able to handle additional traffic. CN is less intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4599)|
| 1:16:47| than some of the zones that are supported by the land use that allows the current PC zone. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| they were to leave the planned commercial zone in place they would have to ask for a land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| designation a sector plan amendment to either GC, RC which is a regional commercial or the CC the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| community commercial. So all those allow more intense uses than what they're asking for. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| that MU-NC designation the property does meet all the location criteria for that specific land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4628)|
| 1:17:17| However the surrounding area doesn't meet the criteria in place for either rezoning or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| plan amendment. So yes I would say there is an error in the plan because this PC zoning has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4642)|
| 1:17:30| been in effect since before the sector plan and sector plan did not acknowledge that. However that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| doesn't necessarily mean that the sector plan is the one that's an error. So when we look at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| sector plan updates and amendments we're always not just looking at the interests of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| owner but the interests of the community. And so the sector plan did call this out as being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| great place for a park. Now that that might not be feasible for the county to purchase this or for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| the owner to to donate it and that's really not our place to say. At the same time though single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| family residential if you were going to sell the property for some sort of use that was you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| made money off of the property would be probably a little bit more compatible with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| area than a commercial neighborhood use. In terms of changes in condition there's not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4693)|
| 1:18:21| any additional infrastructure added no new roads no new lanes no new utilities all that stuff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| been in place for quite some time. The population growth is well below that of the county in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| so you know even though it's it's growing it from 1990 to 2010 those sector plans called it out it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| was growing at about seven percent per year. Since that time it's only grown seven percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| overall. So in the counties in the double digits in terms of growth so definitely population is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| growing not as fast as everywhere else it's it's kind of already maxed out and slowing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| So the also the original zoning that was in place on the property these little slivers right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| provide us a deeper buffer than what would be allowed under the current zoning landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| buffers. So whenever you have commercial uses next to residential uses there's a 25 foot depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4748)|
| 1:19:15| whereas these this measure is deeper than that. I believe it's 80 at its deepest point and 40 at its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| 80 around in here and then 40 around in here. So with that said I'll open it up to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| I know you guys have received a lot of correspondence under oh I did want to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| mention we did hear from Ben Mullins who's representing the applicant he was had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| comments and so one of these things is that there's deed restrictions that are still in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| which we don't ever really get into those are more civil things between between landowners. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| deed restrictions aren't something that we consider when we're looking at sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| We would go crazy trying to find deed restrictions in every property in Knoxville trying to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| our sector plans around that sort of thing. The sector plan placed plan designation insistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| inconsistent with the owner's intent that was another one of his comments and again it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| when we're looking at these we're looking at what's good for the community what we see for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| area not necessarily what each individual property owner wanted. If we did that then I think the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| and county in general would look much different if we just went by individual property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| wants instead of considering the needs of the community. So with that said I'll open it up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| questions. Michelle, Commissioner Adams. Yes Michelle can you go back to I think it's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4827)|
| 1:20:38| slide 16 aerial view yeah you just said you know the job is to figure out what's good for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4838)|
| 1:20:49| community good for the area and when I look at that aerial and I can I I blend that with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4849)|
| 1:20:57| comments from the community everyone seems so incredibly interested in a community space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| a community park and I totally hear you that that's not the jurisdiction of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| this organization to to make that request but I certainly hope that county commissioners county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4870)|
| 1:21:18| officials are listening to that because that visual makes the argument itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| um for the need for some kind of open space that's all thank you Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4884)|
| 1:21:33| no just go ahead and go to Scott um I'll may have something here in a second okay Mr. Scott Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4893)|
| 1:21:43| yeah um I don't know I'm I I guess I don't know I don't I can't uh get my hands around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4903)|
| 1:21:52| you know this property is assumed to be a park and it's really the owner of the it's been for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4912)|
| 1:21:59| sale for 15 years as a commercial property and uh you know the I I just can't imagine that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4919)|
| 1:22:08| you know going to entertain the notion that we just uh mob mob rules kind of we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| take the property as a park I mean a park is great but you know if this is property that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| owned and that's been commercial since 1976 and you know in in my opinion going to neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4940)|
| 1:22:31| commercial from planned commercial is kind of a down zone um I think I think the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| has been uh very kind in in leaving the property open allowing the the community to use it um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4957)|
| 1:22:46| um but I just I would have a real problem um trying to uh do anything to harm the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4966)|
| 1:22:55| in the zoning on the property um but anyway I'm I'm listening I'm trying to I'm trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| what some people are thinking but those are my thoughts Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| thank you so Michelle I guess I want to first start with how do you see the landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=4989)|
| 1:23:25| what are the options for this landowner yeah so that's a good question because how it is right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5005)|
| 1:23:32| now it can't be developed because it's got that LDR which doesn't allow the commercial uses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| it's got the commercial zoning which doesn't allow residential uses so they really couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| develop it at all without getting either a planned amendment or rezoning so their options are either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| to um to rezone the property to a zone that's allowed within that LDR land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| so your rn1 rn2 rn3 um or uh can I can I interrupt for just a second because I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5031)|
| 1:23:59| to make a timely comment and I know maybe you can't um consider the deed restriction but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5039)|
| 1:24:10| but he he can't can he put in residential if it's uh restricted for commercial use only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5050)|
| 1:24:17| so for that I would probably defer to someone who's more clear on the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| grounds for that I don't know if that any that might be you or that might be Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| I don't see any way that he could if if it's clearly in the deed restriction for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| use only that they couldn't so I think we have I mean we we have this is going to be an unpopular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5074)|
| 1:24:42| comment I get it but we have a landowner that stuck he they bought the property with a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5082)|
| 1:24:51| designation all of the residences were on public notice that commercial was intended for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5091)|

| 1:25:11| the community didn't know and I just don't see a way out unless we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| unless we change the sector plan and and the zoning or it's unusable right well there's I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5117)|
| 1:25:27| mean there's also the the fact that the ordinance specifically calls for us to have a change in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| conditions to be able to recommend it and it doesn't meet that condition so you know we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| charged in our recommendation of meeting that ordinance intent the stated that's the law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| we have to follow that's what our recommendation is based on is is meeting those criteria as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| so there's a situation with that and that there hasn't been a change of conditions in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| in quite some time so how does a guy I mean how does the landowner get out he has he has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| opportunity for reasonable use of that property for any use of that property that I don't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| use that he could use right I'm still asking looking for backup on that question with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| deed restrictions and how that works with sale of property because I'm not clear on that myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| was there someone that could jump in that is could shed some light on that I mean I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| looked at the deed restriction myself I don't know that that's something that we can weigh in on at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| this point in terms of but I think Commissioner Hill is correct that if it says that it can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| be developed as residential but again I you know we would need to they would need to work that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| amongst themselves in terms of the property owners well the only way out is to lift the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| deed restriction or to have a court set it aside that's right it's it's not probably not profitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| to speculate about what the deed restrictions may or may not say because it's not an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| consideration your your judgment is to be based upon what's the in the best interest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| community without regard to deed restrictions and there's a different forum to resolve that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| and um really the next approach is to not put that into play in the end of the consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5224)|
| 1:27:13| thank you Mr. Weiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| did you have another question Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| Commissioner Edison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| yeah so can I follow up on you know Commissioner Hill's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| uh Michelle you said that nothing had warranted a change based on the current code but when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| property owner actually purchased this property were they they purchased it under an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5257)|
| 1:27:45| set of criteria so just because we changed the sector plan doesn't mean that when they purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| it they purchased it with they were able to do this so I guess my question just help me understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| we changed the criteria not them so now they're not able to develop property that they purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| and have been holding on to all this time so just kind of help me understand a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| why we can't do this based on staff recommendation based on the fact that the conditions changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| after they had purchased it let me if you don't mind Michelle I'm going to jump in just real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| and then I'll let you um clarify anything I say so I don't think that I don't think Michelle is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| saying that you all cannot um she I think she's saying that we we are basing our recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| on the criteria that's in the zoning ordinance and that is what our recommendation is based off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| doesn't mean it's you are prohibited from making a recommendation in favor of their request okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5316)|
| 1:28:44| thank you at the same time I will say too that um you know whenever there are zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5324)|
| 1:28:54| changes and things like this that this kind of thing does happen zoning doesn't extend you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| forever it's um you know and they typically will have a period of time when the zoning does change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| where they would be able to to um to pursue something I know it's been for sale for 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| so you know that likely has something to do with it as well we haven't changed the the LDR and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| PC both of them have been in place for um decades I would think so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5354)|
| 1:29:25| Commissioner Ross thank you I'm gonna say a couple things um one it sounds to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5365)|
| 1:29:33| we've got a conflict that we need to fix because the property can't be used either way right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| we need to figure out how we can fix that uh the other thing is with this conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| being a park that's all well and good but you can't force somebody to own the property into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| that simply because the people around it want it to be so my suggestion would be if the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| around it want to be a park they should get together and buy it I don't think we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| even be considering that so but at any rate somehow I think we need to fix one or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5401)|
| 1:30:09| um to put this property back where it should be or where the owners have use of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5409)|
| 1:30:20| Commissioner Korbelik| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| yes um thank you I see um several layers of issues here uh and just to run through them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5424)|
| 1:30:32| one is the meeting the criteria for a sector plan amendment one is the historic use as a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5432)|
| 1:30:42| one is the deed restrictions and then the fourth and I'll run through them real quickly I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| want to take up too much time but the fourth which I'd like to address at the moment is uh to to Amy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| what is what when you analyze the best use for a property looking at the community and and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5456)|
| 1:31:05| developer but the community and the surroundings and the context what do you what are the features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| in your analysis because one of the issues is what should this property be if we set everything aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5472)|
| 1:31:20| and just looked at the property and the context what would what would your analysis be as to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| would be the best use that's my first question so Commissioner Korbelik we would look to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| sector plan because the sector plan was developed with the community so that that's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| going to look at we're going to look back to to that and um you know what was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| planned for that property or for the area around it and whether or not the request complies with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| that with that sector plan okay thank you and then just quickly as I read through the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5507)|
| 1:31:56| from the neighborhood they of course would prefer it to remain a park that seems a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| problematic and their fear is with the commercial I'm believing the fear would be some kind of strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| commercial what about the idea of requesting the developer to work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| place deed restrictions on the property that would make sure that it's you know more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5536)|
| 1:32:24| village kind of commercial than a strip commercial is that something that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| developer might be interested in working with the neighborhood to assuage some of their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5550)|
| 1:32:38| that would be a question that you'd want to direct to the developer specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| I don't think it's something that that we can require of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| all right I'll bring that up on Thursday um and then um the criteria to amend the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5567)|
| 1:32:56| that's that is what has me in a dilemma which I share with the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| commissioners thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| commissioner hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| well I respectfully disagree with commissioner korbelik regarding the historic use this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| classic no good deed goes unpunished out of the generosity of the landowner they permitted this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5597)|
| 1:33:26| park use and I haven't had a chance to look through the the zoning but it is a park use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| permitted in in this zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5613)|
| 1:33:42| I would have to look that up let me see if I can go online and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| so I mean I think we've got a problem here that I agree with uh with Jeff my goodness I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5627)|
| 1:34:00| I've seen sector plans changed do you know when when we updated the sector plan did we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5640)|
| 1:34:07| some of these uh existing zonings was it ever addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| Commissioner Hill I don't know that any of the current staff can really speak to that um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5652)|
| 1:34:19| because we weren't here at that time I don't believe any of us were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| Liz you can correct me if if I'm wrong but but I'm not aware of anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5663)|
| 1:34:33| so would it be out of range to to cite an error when it was being considered at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5673)|
| 1:34:41| that would be one of the criteria um there's four to consider but that would be one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5681)|
| 1:34:51| okay so let's just say we look at that one what about the other three what were the other three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| so for a rezoning it is change in conditions that's that's the one that typically gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5699)|
| 1:35:07| hung up fairly frequently consistent with the intent purpose of the applicable zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| ordinance so whether or not the intent of the ordinance meets the area um whether it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5712)|
| 1:35:20| adversely affect another part of the county or the area and whether it's consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| the general plan sector plan and any of the other plans in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| thank you yeah for the plan amendment it's basically the same change of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5731)|
| 1:35:40| introduction of a new infrastructure which could be roads or utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5740)|

| 1:35:54| um using citing change of conditions and that's you know it's pretty vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5754)|
| 1:36:02| not advisable but we've got a big problem here thank you yeah i know that um we have quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=5762)|

| 1:42:08| residential in this one spot when there's not any anywhere around um and so for that reason we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| we're uh not recommending the rural residential in lieu of that lbr so we're recommending to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6134)|

| 1:55:17| again this property adjacent to it was rezoned at the last county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6917)|
| 1:55:26| and uh so they now have zoning on here it hasn't shown up yet on the zoning map online but it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6926)|
| 1:55:34| soon it will say where the a is uh that this is planned residential up to three dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| and acres and again that's what they're asking for in this location as well and no change to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| the floodway zone district um oh sorry i want to make one more quick note about this this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6945)|

| 1:56:14| so this uh shows what the flooding is like in this area um there's obviously a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6974)|
| 1:56:22| portion of both the properties um that are in the floodway as well as in the 100-year flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| plane and the 500-year flood plane that red line denoted on here means that this is best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6988)|
| 1:56:36| county to look at flooding and uh this is the no-fill line um for county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=6996)|
| 1:56:44| and just as a point of reference and to help make it less confusing um there is both a floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7004)|
| 1:56:55| zone district and there are fema floodway designated zones this area uh or this map has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7015)|
| 1:57:04| fema floodway zones overlaid on the zoning map so you can see the old floodway zone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7024)|
| 1:57:11| significantly smaller than the fema designated floodway area this is because that floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| zone district uh was drawn on our zoning map with um you know antiquated data at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7037)|
| 1:57:26| and never updated so uh that's why we see these floodway zones not matching where some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| existing actual floodway areas are so just a point of information about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| so here's utility infrastructure in the area obviously there's sewer and water there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7058)|
| 1:57:45| well it's hydrants already and this is what i was speaking about earlier um was just by me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7065)|
| 1:57:53| earlier um it was just approved um march 29th by county commission for up to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7073)|
| 1:58:00| dwelling units an acre and this is a breakdown of the acreages um in the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| zone and then the acreages within the floodway zone um so you know if you were to just you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7086)|
| 1:58:14| add together um 11.46 with 7.53 times three you know the total number of growing units you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7094)|
| 1:58:26| potentially get in this area would be 56 um however when they come through the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7106)|
| 1:58:35| they might be further limited based on where the fema floodway zones are for those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7115)|
| 1:58:45| so staff is recommending approval of planned residential to three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7125)|
| 1:58:54| other questions commissioner adams yes liz is the three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7134)|
| 1:59:03| just clarify for me is that based upon the no fill line or is that based upon the old record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7143)|
| 1:59:12| it's based upon the old record but like i said they could potentially be further limited that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| why it says estimated maximum number of units with a little asterisk beside it because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| may be further limited um you know when we talk about density with uh some of these rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7162)|
| 1:59:31| since we don't have a plan we don't know necessarily what the exact design issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| that they may encounter so when they get their surveys and their design work done for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| properties so they'll they'll know more where their buildable area actually is and i'm trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7180)|
| 1:59:48| to track here on your current slide if you were using the no fill zone that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7188)|
| 1:59:55| obviously less than three dwelling units would that be 2.47 or um so this is not the no fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7195)|
| 2:00:05| area this is just the floodway zone i'll go back and show you the difference between them yeah i'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7205)|
| 2:00:10| just trying to get a handle on how different so here is the floodway zone so there is this much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| area that's in the no fill area outside of the floodway zone so again you know they will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7216)|
| 2:00:24| further limited here and the gis information that we have access to you know here uh is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7224)|
| 2:00:33| really an estimate um it requires more intensive site planning um the design plan stage so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7233)|
| 2:00:43| they'll know the exact buildable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| in this sort of space okay i'm gonna ask one more question sorry to be a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7247)|
| 2:00:56| so if based upon this recommendation of three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| that rezoning is approved and then their buildable area is much more limited because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7261)|
| 2:01:14| different assessments or further assessments but that zoning continues doesn't that mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| that they would have the ability to put three dwelling units per acre on a much smaller patch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| of land necessarily i think um the subdivision regulations and the stormwater management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7285)|
| 2:01:33| regulation for knox county would limit them further in this area that's why we often see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| developments where you know they have asked for planned residential to five dwelling units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7299)|
| 2:01:46| acre but they only build out at 2.5 because they encounter various site constraints during their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| design process okay thanks for continuing to answer that for me okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7311)|
| 2:02:01| okay thank you commissioner adams and linds i don't see any other hands up okay all right so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7321)|
| 2:02:07| now we can move on to the willow banks thanks yes um this has been an incredibly confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7327)|
| 2:02:17| application because it is split between the city and the county so we have two applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7337)|
| 2:02:26| one is for a sector plan amendment and a rezoning within the county and then one is for a sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7346)|
| 2:02:34| plan amendment a one-year plan amendment and a rezoning within the city so you can see here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| on the county application the highlighted area is the county area they're asking to go from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| general commercial and uh hillside protection to uh mixed use special district and hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7367)|
| 2:02:56| protection they're also asking for a rezoning to go from cb in this area to light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7376)|
| 2:03:05| um and this is what it looks like for the city application um and there are multiple parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7385)|
| 2:03:12| involved in both of these applications and um portions of multiple parcels involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7392)|
| 2:03:20| so uh this is a summary i'm not going to go through each one of these of what it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| i think when i show you the zoning map may become a little bit more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| um basically they want this area that seems to be a mix of agriculture and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7410)|
| 2:03:38| zone districts to go to ig um and light industrial zone districts um so the ig is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7418)|
| 2:03:47| a city zone district the li is a county zone district and this is at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7427)|
| 2:03:55| with callahan drive and i-75 um this is what the one-year plan looks like so this makes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7435)|
| 2:04:05| a little easier to see where the um differences are between the city and the county obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7445)|
| 2:04:12| the one-year plan only applies to the city so you can see this mixed use special district along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7452)|
| 2:04:19| callahan road it allows a mix of commercial and industrial uses recognizing the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7459)|
| 2:04:27| uses in that area as well as the existing zone districts so the applicant's request is to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7467)|
| 2:04:32| this mixed use special district back into this general commercial and low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7472)|
| 2:04:39| area and in the city it will also retain the hillside protection area as part of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7479)|
| 2:04:47| at this location so let's go back quickly just to let you know so this is currently zoned ag now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7487)|
| 2:04:57| this is an area that they would be limited um in clearing and grading um in any area that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7497)|

| 2:12:30| i think it would be less appropriate if those that development was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| within the neighborhood itself like further in i've said on a main main road there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=7954)|

| 2:13:29| some buffering um in this area um you know there's not necessarily a guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=8009)|

| 2:18:53| uh in the whole carter town center area because the intensity of residential development that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=8333)|

| 2:19:33| this again is what the sector plan looks like if the rezoning were to go through this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210406-agenda-review?start=8373)|
