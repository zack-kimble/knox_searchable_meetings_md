| 2:30:29| they're burning a lot of money on fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| So that's why this location from an operational standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| Proximity to the interstate is good for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| It makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| And also we believe that it's better from a life safety standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| not going through residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| Would you refuel on the site of the terminal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| We do have fuel built in on site as well as a maintenance shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| So you might have other effluents other than just what sits on the pavement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9053)|
| 2:30:57| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| You might have other effluents than just what sits on the pavement from fueling or other things, maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| Things to deal with as an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| All of that is contained and, of course, will meet all of the ordinances and standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9068)|
| 2:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9074)|
| 2:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9075)|
| 2:31:16| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9076)|
| 2:31:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| I wanted to support this today, but after meeting with Jim and looking at this site plan, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| and the level of removal, as someone who served on the Slope and Ridge Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9085)|
| 2:31:31| I can't in good conscience just consider the removal of this deep area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| I was hoping that being codified for the city that, you know, but there's always wiggle room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9096)|
| 2:31:42| and if we do this, then you can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| But the ultimate end result is going to be that removed, and I personally can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9104)|
| 2:31:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9113)|
| 2:31:54| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9114)|
| 2:31:55| I had two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9115)|
| 2:31:56| One, when you talked about the number of employees, is that new employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9116)|
| 2:32:00| or will they be moving from where they're located over to the new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| How many actual new employees will this employ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9124)|
| 2:32:10| Day one, 170 jobs from a growth standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9130)|
| 2:32:17| We're looking at about a 4% growth per year, so around that 220 to 240,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9137)|
| 2:32:24| we don't know exactly what that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| That will be in year 2022 and year about 2030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| I know it's a long way out, but the best that we can project is about 270 total jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| from a net ad standpoint day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| There will be no new jobs added day one, but within the first few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| the client will start to post job openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| So it's kind of hard to answer exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| but I can tell you that it will be a $7.5 million annual payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9175)|
| 2:33:01| and you had mentioned earlier asking about the salary and the hourly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| It's about $60,000 to $65,000 annual salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| But that's existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| That's not new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9192)|
| 2:33:13| It's the existing jobs from where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| It's hard to answer because they're transferring over jobs from the current location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| and then they project about a 4% growth per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| so it would be about 220 to 240 jobs by year 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| There will be about a 50 to 70 net ad by 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9213)|
| 2:33:34| And then, Dan, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| How many truck terminal facilities do we have in Knoxville, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| I don't know the answer to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| but in the city and the county there are a number of terminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| What are they zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| There's no one in the city that's C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9232)|
| 2:33:57| They're probably in the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| The PC zone is a very broad zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| It talks about distribution centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| It talks about hose mailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9246)|
| 2:34:07| It talks about kind of dances around a lot of different uses like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9247)|
| 2:34:14| And as you heard earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| sometimes it is a requirement that the building official have to make an interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9257)|
| 2:34:24| And in this particular case, there was discussion with Peter in that regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9264)|
| 2:34:31| as to whether or not a truck terminal would be a use that could be permitted in the PC2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9271)|
| 2:34:38| And I think the answer that we got from him was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9278)|
| 2:34:44| So, again, PC2 allows a lot of different uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9284)|
| 2:34:53| And so does C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| And just for the record, Mr. Wolfenbarger got up and said that I said that zoning did not comply with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9295)|
| 2:35:03| The current East County Sector Plan and one-year plan designate this property for general commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| and the PC2 zone is a zone that complies with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9309)|
| 2:35:17| I'm like my colleague, Mr. Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| I have a real concern over when I look at the elevations and when I think about the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| when I look at the plan, even though there's no dimensions on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| but if you take the plan and put it on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| we're really carving away an awful lot of land on that corner and then also with the number of sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| So there's a real concern in terms of environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| And it's obvious if, in fact, those gentlemen are talking on behalf of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| they said they would rather take their chances with a C4 than to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| And it's obvious the site's been sitting there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| So it's a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9356)|
| 2:35:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| I'm terribly uncomfortable with this as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9359)|
| 2:36:02| and I'm dismayed that the Hillside Ridgetop regulations don't apply in C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9362)|
| 2:36:09| How is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| I mean, I thought it applied to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| The engineering department and or the building official's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| are not charged with enforcing plans like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9377)|
| 2:36:22| That comes through the planning commission and the action of the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9382)|
| 2:36:26| So from that standpoint, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9386)|
| 2:36:30| if somebody applies for a grading permit within the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9390)|
| 2:36:36| and they comply with the city's requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| they will presumably be issued a grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9398)|
| 2:36:44| It seems to me that that kind of conflicts with what I thought this council had done several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9404)|
| 2:36:51| to make that apply everywhere, not sporadically, but everywhere in all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| We may have to make some corrections in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| Right now, I just can't support changing this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9421)|
| 2:37:05| Obviously, some are not comfortable with the regulatory bodies that are involved here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9425)|
| 2:37:13| maybe TDAC, I don't know, maybe engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| But there must be a discomfort somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9436)|
| 2:37:19| because what you suggest makes some logical sense to me to have more oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9439)|
| 2:37:25| and that's what the PC2 apparently offers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| Considerably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9453)|
| 2:37:34| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9454)|
| 2:37:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9455)|
| 2:37:36| So, Mr. Kelly, I want to make sure I understood this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| that the hillside and ridgetop plan does not apply to the C4 areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9458)|
| 2:37:47| The way the planning commission can enforce the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9467)|
| 2:37:56| let me get my brain in gear before I—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| if something is a use on review in a C4 zone and comes through the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9480)|
| 2:38:05| that opens the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| If it's a permitted use, if it's a new or used car dealer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9487)|
| 2:38:13| which is a permitted use where you would have multiple vehicles sitting on the ground out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9493)|
| 2:38:20| they wouldn't have to come through the planning commission for any review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| in order to be able to locate it in the C4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| They would go into the permitting process through the building official in the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| So, clarify for me, please, the zone that was approved at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9514)|
| 2:38:40| will the ridgeside hilltop plan apply to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9520)|
| 2:38:45| We will review any plan in the PC2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| and every use in the PC2 zone requires approval every—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9529)|
| 2:38:57| every plan, every development plan requires approval by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| Okay, I'm just trying to get clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| what council should or should not be considering for this proposed change to the PC2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9548)|
| 2:39:17| I think the question was does the hillside ridgetop plan apply in the planned district that's being proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9557)|
| 2:39:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9571)|
| 2:39:32| It does apply there, but it does not apply in the current—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| It applies through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| Through the use—and that's what they will be required to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9580)|
| 2:39:41| So, if you're concerned about the ridgetop plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| the way that gets addressed is through—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| PC2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's through this proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9587)|
| 2:39:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9592)|
| 2:39:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9593)|
| 2:39:54| Otherwise, it does not get—it does not come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| for any development on that property in the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9596)|
| 2:40:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9603)|
| 2:40:04| You can ask Mr. Herriman how many times they've applied the hillside plan in reviewing a grading plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9604)|
| 2:40:11| It's not codified in ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| It is a plan, so it really is not exercised in permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9614)|
| 2:40:20| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| But if it just comes to you as a permit request, you don't look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| It takes a zoning change to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| This is similar to—and it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| This is similar to the discussion that we're having with regard to the property on Garden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9632)|
| 2:40:39| The—whether the plans apply to permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9639)|
| 2:40:52| Ms. Malone has discussed that numerous times with various people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| and so from that standpoint, this is where you could do six-plex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| but you might be able to do three duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9663)|
| 2:41:09| This is structural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| George is going to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| I was just—the vice mayor was gesturing over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| Apparently, we didn't codify the plan as ordinance, but it was adopted as a plan in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9677)|
| 2:41:24| I thought it was law, and the county did not approve it or codify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| Maybe our law director can please clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| I wish I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| I have to tell—I have not researched this because the issue hasn't really come up in quite a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9697)|
| 2:41:43| but my belief was—and this is just steering absolutely from the seat of my pants—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9703)|
| 2:41:49| was that the hilltop and ridgeside or whatever that plan was applied in every zone across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9709)|
| 2:41:56| It was a plan that had to be adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| And so when I'm hearing now that it doesn't get applied for permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9719)|
| 2:42:06| it doesn't sound right to me, but I have to go back and research it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| and see if that, in fact, in some way is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| But I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9733)|
| 2:42:17| But it's never been codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| It was just adopted as a plan because I remember at the time being mortified that it was not codified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9739)|
| 2:42:25| that it was just—we adopted the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| The commission did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| Is there any rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| Should we postpone this two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| I had one motion earlier that was shot down pretty quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| but the water made me muddy enough here that I could get more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| I make a motion we postpone it and get the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| Two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9765)|
| 2:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9766)|
| 2:42:47| There's a motion to postpone for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9769)|
| 2:42:50| For how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9770)|
| 2:42:52| It has to be a minimum of four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| Motion to postpone four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9778)|
| 2:42:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9779)|
| 2:43:00| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| There is a 120-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| The opponents had a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9785)|
| 2:43:09| I just want to make sure we aren't running up against a 120-day decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9789)|
| 2:43:16| Dan, when was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9796)|
| 2:43:20| That's less than 50 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9800)|
| 2:43:21| That's the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9801)|
| 2:43:22| The agenda date was July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| I don't remember that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| August, September, October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| We aren't running up against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9811)|
| 2:43:35| We'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| Mr. Swanson believes you'd be okay on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| It's 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| It's through September anyway, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| Are you all okay with four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| Why four weeks rather than two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| Why four weeks instead of two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| Mr. Dellivope, he won't be here in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| It's his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| It's his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9836)|
| 2:43:57| The council will go along whether a council member is present or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| It's his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9839)|
| 2:44:00| I think out of respect for the council person from that district that we should honor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| They're all our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| They're all our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| We don't get that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| All right, let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| Then vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| Okay, the motion, it was a motion and a second, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| To postpone four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| We'll be okay, will we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9856)|
| 2:44:19| Okay, so the motion before us is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9859)|
| 2:44:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| That motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| Okay, so before we go to the, did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9871)|
| 2:44:35| Yeah, I just want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| Thank you all for this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| but it would really be helpful if applicants would get information to us beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9879)|
| 2:44:44| It's hard to assimilate or kind of look over this as we're sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9884)|
| 2:44:48| so just for future reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| Are you speaking to us or to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| To whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| To whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9894)|
| 2:44:55| You said you're the one who gave us this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| Well taken, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9899)|
| 2:45:00| Council, we've been sitting for two hours and 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| As everybody else out here, we're going to take a brief break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| because we're going to have another big discussion, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9906)|
| 2:45:10| Okay, so we will now move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9910)|
| 2:45:13| Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| 12C is an ordinance to amend Chapter 16 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| to add a new article entitled Short-Term Rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| to establish regulations for short-term rental units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| Okay, so we have three people signed up to speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9924)|
| 2:45:31| Do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| Yeah, I just want to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| I don't know if the audience knows this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| but Mr. Frost thought that we needed to make basically a list of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9935)|
| 2:45:41| we want MPC to evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| We certainly don't want to send them a blank slate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| and they'll look at us and send it back without touching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| So I thought one of the things we were going to try to do tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| was to make a list of the kinds of changes we would like to see MPC evaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9952)|
| 2:45:57| and that may go pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| That may or may not affect the public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9959)|
| 2:46:01| and we're certainly here to hear them too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| I don't know how you want to proceed, but I'll just mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| Yeah, why don't you explain, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| Okay, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9970)|
| 2:46:13| As this council knows, short-term rentals has been very hotly discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9973)|
| 2:46:19| among members of the public and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9979)|
| 2:46:22| There have been two, if not three, workshops on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9982)|
| 2:46:27| It was postponed to allow workshops to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| Then we had to have a motion to reconsider in order for MPC to consider certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9993)|
| 2:46:41| that this council was going to ask them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| in order for it to be voted on by the present members of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10004)|
| 2:46:53| As I stated in my email yesterday, there is a state Supreme Court decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10013)|
| 2:47:00| boiling it down real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| This body can consider only what the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10023)|
| 2:47:08| has considered for deals with land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10028)|
| 2:47:13| My thought and suggestion was that members of council lay out the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10033)|
| 2:47:20| that they would like MPC to respectfully consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10040)|
| 2:47:26| That would allow giving MPC a road map of what you want them to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10046)|
| 2:47:31| so they can undertake their duties within time to return it to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10051)|
| 2:47:39| for council to, at that point, debate and potentially make amendments on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10059)|
| 2:47:46| by the present members of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10066)|
| 2:47:51| Vice Mayor Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10071)|
| 2:47:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10072)|
| 2:47:54| Along with what Rob is saying, I do intend to make a motion that once we hear the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10074)|
| 2:47:58| that we do send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| One of the things that we did when we decided to have the workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10081)|
| 2:48:05| and to postpone this was to develop a schedule by which the five members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10085)|
| 2:48:12| five of us who are going off, will be able to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| depending if everything falls in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| The next step after our workshops was to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10098)|
| 2:48:21| and take into consideration what was talked about at the workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10101)|
| 2:48:26| both the council workshop and the public workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| to come up with those kinds of ideas or conditions that we would like for MPC to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10109)|
| 2:48:34| to go with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| That's where we are right now in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| We've had our workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| I understand we have a couple of people that want to make some additional comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| but then the idea was, or the motion that I plan to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10124)|
| 2:48:48| is that depending on what those comments are that people want MPC to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| that we do send it back to MPC for their concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| The date is that tonight is when we have to do that in order for MPC to meet in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10135)|
| 2:49:02| so that it does, if MPC either sends it back or acts on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10142)|
| 2:49:06| sends it back to us so that we can act on it before our last meeting in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10146)|
| 2:49:10| So that was the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| Okay, so you want to hear from the individuals first who are here to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10158)|
| 2:49:19| Okay, first to speak for the ordinance is Patty Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| Patty, would you like to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10162)|
| 2:49:29| As you noticed, your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| and the timer will set you up is up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| Patty Barrier, 807 Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10177)|
| 2:49:42| Anyways, I guess I'm a little bit out of the loop because I couldn't make it to the workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10182)|
| 2:49:46| but I definitely had e-mails that went to MPC and to council speaking with regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10186)|
| 2:49:55| So I'm assuming that also those letters that are attached to this that was on the agenda tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10195)|
| 2:50:02| are also being taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10202)|
| 2:50:05| I'm actually, I am forward as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10205)|
| 2:50:12| The reason why is because I think there needs to be some restrictions to safeguard R1, R1E, SW1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10212)|
| 2:50:23| My preference would be to actually not have short-term rentals within the R1, R1E, and the SW1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10223)|
| 2:50:36| We are all residential, to protect residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| And I had just noticed, I read through all letters that were attached to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10240)|
| 2:50:48| and I noticed that people would like to use short-term rentals as an intermediate go between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10248)|
| 2:50:54| let's say, a long-term rental or between selling a house or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10254)|
| 2:50:58| To me, that's only a loophole that gets short-term rentals in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10258)|
| 2:51:05| Me personally, I think if you have long-term rentals and you're planning on re-renting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| that you spend that time to maintenance, keep up the property, make sure it's ready to be rented again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10270)|
| 2:51:20| Anyways, I think that residential areas need to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| Short-term rentals, they can go into other zonings that are a little more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10285)|
| 2:51:34| Anyways, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10294)|
| 2:51:35| Thank you, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| Okay, next we have Dr. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10298)|
| 2:51:42| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| I know you know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10304)|
| 2:51:45| Set your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| Reuben Pelow, 8437 Cortland Drive, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10310)|
| 2:51:58| I am here to speak to you all about the short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10318)|
| 2:52:06| I'm currently serving as the president of the West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10326)|
| 2:52:11| We are not an HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10331)|
| 2:52:13| We are a community association, but we have about 1,300 households in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10333)|
| 2:52:21| Our community association voted for me to come to tell you that we are not in favor of short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10341)|
| 2:52:30| A lot of the reasons, I think you all have already heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| and some of you have been very gracious to listen to our complaints about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10354)|
| 2:52:40| and our opposition to the short-term rental to be in our residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10360)|
| 2:52:47| We are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| Several issues would be, from a safety standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10369)|
| 2:52:53| I think you've got to always consider the fact when you bring in strangers into your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10373)|
| 2:52:59| there's always a reason to be concerned from a safety standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10379)|
| 2:53:06| The property values that are associated with rental properties has always been an issue for long-time residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10386)|
| 2:53:17| The short-term issue doesn't change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10397)|
| 2:53:22| I know in our neighborhood we have some rental properties that are people who are residing in property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10402)|
| 2:53:29| The owners are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| I know we have a current issue where one of our neighbors is going to have to go to municipal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10411)|
| 2:53:38| because the owner of a house next door has charged her with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10418)|
| 2:53:44| I do not know what the charge is, but she complained that it's because her dog used the bathroom in his yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10424)|
| 2:53:53| and she didn't pick up, and so he's brought charges against her, and actually she's got to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10433)|
| 2:54:01| I'm unhappy about that, and he lives in Morristown, so that's a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10441)|
| 2:54:08| We also have some households that are probably short-term rentals that we don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10448)|
| 2:54:14| We also have some households that are halfway houses that we didn't know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10454)|
| 2:54:19| and one of them we heard about not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| But at any rate, nothing real new from the standpoint of being in opposition to short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10462)|
| 2:54:29| as far as the R1E or the R1 classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10469)|
| 2:54:34| You've heard that over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| I support that, and I have recently learned, though, that it was news to me that the state fire marshal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10476)|
| 2:54:47| and you may be aware of this, that they're going to classify short-term rentals as being R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10487)|
| 2:54:54| and they will have to have sprinkler systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10494)|
| 2:54:58| I guess it would be in beginning or new facilities, not those that are existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| I'm not sure, but that's going to be an added expense to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10503)|
| 2:55:08| The income from the short-term rentals has been an issue that's been talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10508)|
| 2:55:13| These people that have them want to be able to derive an income from their short-term rentals that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10513)|
| 2:55:21| to support their livelihood, but I've heard very little talk about what it's going to do to the property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10521)|
| 2:55:29| for the residents in the R1 and R1E zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10529)|
| 2:55:36| So at any rate, I applaud you all for taking this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10536)|
| 2:55:40| I don't think you're going to get a whole lot of extra sleep because of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10540)|
| 2:55:45| and we'll have to wait and see what our friends down in Nashville do to us in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10545)|
| 2:55:51| but I think you all need to do what you're going to do and not be afraid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10551)|
| 2:55:55| But thank you very much for allowing us to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| I do have some friends with me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| I'd like for those that are here representing the opposition to short-term rentals to stand up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10560)|
| 2:56:06| if you can stand up at this late hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10566)|
| 2:56:11| There's some party souls, and I want to thank them for being out, and thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10571)|
| 2:56:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| Now we have Ms. Lee Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| Lee Hume here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| Mr. Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10585)|
| 2:56:26| Please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10586)|
| 2:56:30| My name is Lee Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10590)|
| 2:56:31| I live at 6902 Haverhill Drive in Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| I live in West Hills and have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| Now we've raised our daughter, and now our daughter is living there with her new son and family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10600)|
| 2:56:47| And we've been in West Hills for over 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| and one of the things that we've really enjoyed about West Hills was what attracted us to West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10609)|
| 2:56:54| and like many people who've been attracted to neighborhoods where they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10614)|
| 2:56:58| there's a quality of life and the stability of the neighborhood and how well established it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10618)|
| 2:57:05| Stability, though, is based on long-term commitment by everybody in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10625)|
| 2:57:10| When you introduce the idea of having short-term rental where you have people that are in for less than 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10630)|
| 2:57:17| in a property coming and going, and we know probably on average it's maybe two, three nights or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10637)|
| 2:57:23| it's disruptive to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| People don't know who happens to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| It's totally out of character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10648)|
| 2:57:34| My main concern, and I'm new to this whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| and what brought me in was that I was concerned about the idea of a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10658)|
| 2:57:43| And what really got me attracted to this whole issue was that my daughter had owned a condo not far from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10663)|
| 2:57:51| She sold it to an individual who has since turned it into a short-term rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10671)|
| 2:57:58| It bothers me tremendously because we invested a lot of time, energy, and money in bringing her condo up to a higher standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10678)|
| 2:58:06| which made it more attractive for selling to this person who bought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| who paid more than what we had invested, and it was a nice return on her investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10690)|
| 2:58:18| We thought, though, that it was going to be like anybody else that lived in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10698)|
| 2:58:23| that it would be their residence, not become a business enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10703)|
| 2:58:30| And by doing that, there was just a sense of violation about the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10710)|
| 2:58:36| And what I find disturbing was city council entertaining the idea of basically legalizing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10716)|
| 2:58:45| that is in violation of existing zoning law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10725)|
| 2:58:49| To me, it's very distasteful, and I'm very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10729)|
| 2:58:52| I know that there are pressures that are being applied to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10732)|
| 2:58:57| There are enterprises like Airbnb, and I know there are other businesses that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10737)|
| 2:59:03| But those businesses have no interest in the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10743)|
| 2:59:07| Those businesses have interest in generating revenue for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10747)|
| 2:59:13| And it's at the expense of communities like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10753)|
| 2:59:17| And Airbnb, and I don't know what the other ones are called, but I know they're out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10757)|
| 2:59:23| they don't have an interest in the quality of life for the people who live in those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| They have an interest in return on their investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| So it's minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| Bless her heart, Jean Teague used to talk about the book on how Airbnb came into being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10774)|
| 2:59:40| and how they would go to investors and they would brag about how they've created the world's largest hotel chain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10780)|
| 2:59:47| with zero capital investment other than their software and marketing efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10787)|
| 2:59:55| That's wrong to me because their capital investment doesn't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10795)|
| 3:00:01| but it's really the homeowners and the communities that actually built the value of that individual property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10801)|
| 3:00:08| because we as a community all are invested in it and we need to protect our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10808)|
| 3:00:14| And I was moved by the earlier family that Councilman Brown recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10814)|
| 3:00:20| and their comments in talking about leadership in communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10820)|
| 3:00:24| and the trust that communities put in organizations like city council and the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10824)|
| 3:00:31| to look out for the quality of life in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| And I only ask you as somebody that's new to this process to please honor that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10835)|
| 3:00:40| that we feel the city has to us as homeowners and people who live in all residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10840)|
| 3:00:47| And I know there are many more than just R1 and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10847)|
| 3:00:51| And I feel like to segregate those particular zones from everything else I think is wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10851)|
| 3:00:58| because that doesn't give any protection to people who are in other residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10858)|
| 3:01:03| So please think through this and realize what may come from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| because if you open this opportunity for this kind of an enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10867)|
| 3:01:11| what's the next enterprise that's going to want to invade a neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10878)|
| 3:01:24| Okay, that's everybody who signed up to speak, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10884)|
| 3:01:28| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10888)|
| 3:01:29| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10889)|
| 3:01:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| I'd like to make a motion that we refer the ordinance, the short-term ordinance, back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10895)|
| 3:01:41| And I respectfully request that MPC complete its consideration and return to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10901)|
| 3:01:47| by the November 7th meeting so that the present council can vote on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10907)|
| 3:01:53| And I would like to, along with council, have the following comments and concerns considered by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10913)|
| 3:02:04| And I can either start or have council start if there's a second to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10924)|
| 3:02:09| Wait, you're going to have us later list these items this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| Well, along with, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| He's going to list them first and then invite you to add more to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10938)|
| 3:02:19| Why don't you make your list first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10939)|
| 3:02:20| Okay, I'll go ahead and make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10943)|
| 3:02:24| Tell us your list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10944)|
| 3:02:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10945)|
| 3:02:26| Number one, that short-term rentals not be permitted in the R1 or R1E zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10946)|
| 3:02:32| Number two, that STRs, if allowed, that they be owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10952)|
| 3:02:39| Require that the owner be present, no more than two bedrooms or four people per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10959)|
| 3:02:45| Number three, a clear process for the application process and notification of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10965)|
| 3:02:51| Number four, a clear procedure for enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10971)|
| 3:02:56| and a dedicated individual by the city assigned to the application and enforcement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10976)|
| 3:03:03| Establish a geographic area relating to the location for the STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10983)|
| 3:03:10| And of those existing STRs that could be grandfathered in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| that some type of restitution be allowed when acquiring a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=10994)|
| 3:03:23| Those are some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11003)|
| 3:03:24| Acquiring what restitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11004)|
| 3:03:26| We have a number of existing short-term rentals right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11006)|
| 3:03:31| and to have those grandfathered in, however, when they go to apply for a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11011)|
| 3:03:36| since they are operating illegal, have some type of restitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| By them to us, to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| To the city, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| Again, these are things to send back for them to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11024)|
| 3:03:48| And I have a list to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| Okay, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| So anyway, that's the motion with that on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| With that, and then can they just add to that motion, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11035)|
| 3:04:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11040)|
| 3:04:01| Okay, so next, Councilman Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| Well, I don't want to repeat the ones that he has already said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| but my first request is that they consider drafting a sort of a regional map for STRs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11047)|
| 3:04:17| like Chattanooga did, where they defined a physical area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| For example, in Knoxville, it might be the downtown and Fort Sanders area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11061)|
| 3:04:27| It might include some portion of, whether it's Old North or other neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11067)|
| 3:04:34| that have a greater interest in using money for restoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11074)|
| 3:04:37| than they do in sort of freezing the lines and protecting the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11077)|
| 3:04:43| But some consideration by MPC with its map-making ability to define an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11083)|
| 3:04:48| where this activity would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11088)|
| 3:04:51| And my thought is simply that we ought to start small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| and make it very clear where it's allowed and where it's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11094)|
| 3:04:59| With regard to the R1 and R2, again, I would support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| but those aren't the only single-family residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11102)|
| 3:05:06| And so, again, I would prefer a mapping designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11106)|
| 3:05:10| but if not, I would support the R1 and R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11110)|
| 3:05:13| There are other exclusively residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11113)|
| 3:05:16| or mostly exclusively residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| And I would like MPC to be considering the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11119)|
| 3:05:24| that we're here to build neighborhoods, not destroy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11124)|
| 3:05:28| We're here to keep commercial activity out of bedroom communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11128)|
| 3:05:32| And so how do we draw on that aspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11132)|
| 3:05:36| The third comment, I think, has to do with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11136)|
| 3:05:40| It seems like we have dodged what looks like a practical impossibility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11140)|
| 3:05:47| We have 300 violators under current law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| and we have not enforced any except for five specific complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11150)|
| 3:05:54| But we have heard at great length from the people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11154)|
| 3:05:58| at the workshops and elsewhere that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| folks don't want to turn in their neighbors if they don't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11161)|
| 3:06:04| and they kind of bite their lip and draw the shades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| and hope the problem goes away after Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11166)|
| 3:06:10| But this idea of what is the enforcement requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11170)|
| 3:06:14| are we going to have public hearings if they want an STR in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11174)|
| 3:06:19| or area other than the designated sort of tourist district, if you will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11179)|
| 3:06:27| Chattanooga, for example, has a procedure whereby you apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11187)|
| 3:06:32| but if any neighbor objects and you have to post a sign and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11192)|
| 3:06:36| they get to have a hearing on whether it should be there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11196)|
| 3:06:39| But we're at a crossroads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11199)|
| 3:06:42| I mean, we can talk about the sharing community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11202)|
| 3:06:46| and why that's developing, whether we control it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11206)|
| 3:06:50| or we can talk about the fabric of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11210)|
| 3:06:53| which is that the residential neighborhoods are the value of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11213)|
| 3:06:58| and are what make it a great place to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| And we have to find ways, and I'm hoping MPC's cleverer than us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11221)|
| 3:07:06| find ways to protect those communities and those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11226)|
| 3:07:11| And I sit there and scratch my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11231)|
| 3:07:14| I don't know how many meetings I've been to for watch groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| and everything else forming to kind of know who's coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11237)|
| 3:07:20| and who's coming out and neighborhood nosiness that keeps the place safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11240)|
| 3:07:24| and then we bring in strangers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11244)|
| 3:07:26| It seems contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| Also, some interpretation as to whether if this is a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11248)|
| 3:07:33| instead of just a different kind of rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11253)|
| 3:07:36| does this open the door for other business activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11256)|
| 3:07:40| I mean, all of a sudden we're going to want to have a barber shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11260)|
| 3:07:44| and a, I don't know, a moon pie house and a coffee shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11264)|
| 3:07:48| and things are going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11268)|
| 3:07:50| And maybe that's good, maybe that's bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| but we are opening the door to the commercialization of residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11272)|
| 3:07:57| and I think we have to tread very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11277)|
| 3:07:59| So all those things and the generic statement of let's start small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11279)|
| 3:08:05| and build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| Let's pick a piece of turf that we think this makes the most sense in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11287)|
| 3:08:12| if we're going to do this and see how that works for a few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11292)|
| 3:08:16| and then come back and expand or contract or modify what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11296)|
| 3:08:20| But to just flip open the doors to the whole community I think is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11300)|
| 3:08:24| I've said too much already, so I'm going to shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| But those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| So stated, so stipulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11312)|
| 3:08:35| Well, a couple things I want to make sure we talk quite a bit about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| and that's the sunset policy for the non-conforming owner operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11319)|
| 3:08:46| that are operating now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| There's some sunset period for them to unwind that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11328)|
| 3:08:52| and we would look for a policy with a time from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11332)|
| 3:08:58| I think that any hearing panel should have at least two people from the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| There should be some type of hearing panel with people from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| and not just city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| I think the taxes that are being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| the hotel tax that should be allowed to be collected by the STR web host| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11353)|
| 3:09:19| and paid directly as the owner could as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11359)|
| 3:09:25| I think consideration and discussion ought to be for allowing non-owner occupants of STRs in H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11365)|
| 3:09:34| As bed and breakfasts are allowed to operate in an H1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11374)|
| 3:09:39| consideration should be discussed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11379)|
| 3:09:44| I think that there should be consideration as well in the R2 and R3 zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11384)|
| 3:09:52| Again, this is something for MPC to consider and to come back to us with recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11392)|
| 3:09:58| I think the application process and the enforcement process is absolute key to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11398)|
| 3:10:05| to provide the safeguards to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11405)|
| 3:10:09| I think consideration ought to be given to notifying the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11409)|
| 3:10:13| or the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11413)|
| 3:10:14| I think notification to the council district person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| Require physical inspections from fire and building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11416)|
| 3:10:20| I think it ought to be enforcement and notification and process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11420)|
| 3:10:27| and application should be in person and not by affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11427)|
| 3:10:37| That's the gist of mine. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11437)|
| 3:10:41| Thank you. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11443)|
| 3:10:44| I was not here for a couple of the workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| so I apologize for that since I was out of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11447)|
| 3:10:51| But I've seen that there have been a couple of places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11451)|
| 3:10:54| or maybe more than a couple across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| there have been some problems with STR and discrimination against people based on race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11457)|
| 3:11:04| I'd like for MPC, the law department, or whoever is appropriate to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11464)|
| 3:11:10| It may be covered by a federal statute. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11470)|
| 3:11:13| But to make sure that if we do legalize STRs here in Knoxville, that that is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11473)|
| 3:11:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| Thank you. Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11483)|
| 3:11:25| Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| I think you made a good start, a good stab at it, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11487)|
| 3:11:32| I agree with about all that you have listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11492)|
| 3:11:37| One issue very specific to my district that I would like to ask for consideration from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11497)|
| 3:11:46| is to try to determine a fair and reasonable area in and around the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11506)|
| 3:11:57| because it is unique to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11517)|
| 3:12:01| I don't think there will ever be another urban wilderness in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11521)|
| 3:12:05| But there are a lot of folks that I've heard from my district that are supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11525)|
| 3:12:13| Let me say this. I don't really like excluding things for certain districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11533)|
| 3:12:18| but I would hope that everybody would agree that the urban wilderness is certainly unique to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11538)|
| 3:12:26| That's why I'm asking for this special consideration, which is a little unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11546)|
| 3:12:33| But, again, I think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11553)|
| 3:12:37| I think that the short-term rentals really lend itself to folks who would want to utilize the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11557)|
| 3:12:46| I think there's a market for it with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| It wouldn't affect the rest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| But, again, I think it needs to be fair and reasonable to the core neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11572)|
| 3:12:59| and not just the areas, you know, just full run of anything around the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11579)|
| 3:13:05| But I think it's very important, and I think it will certainly accentuate the success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11585)|
| 3:13:10| the continued success of the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11590)|
| 3:13:13| So with that, I couldn't add any more than what has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11593)|
| 3:13:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11601)|
| 3:13:22| I guess the only thing I would add, and this might not be the right venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11602)|
| 3:13:26| is to look and see if we can require some of the things we're requiring of these people for long-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11606)|
| 3:13:33| A lot of these issues that people are concerned about, parking, noise, I mean, these happen regularly with current rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11613)|
| 3:13:41| And if we had a landlord list and some of these things that are in this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11621)|
| 3:13:47| that we might be able to address some of those problems as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11627)|
| 3:13:50| So that's my only recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11630)|
| 3:13:53| Thank you, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11633)|
| 3:13:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11634)|
| 3:13:55| Well, only a few other suggestions, and actually follow up on some that Councilman Wallace said in the application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11635)|
| 3:14:02| and notifying neighbors, ensuring that there is adequate parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11642)|
| 3:14:07| and if we can, ask the applicant to suggest some rules for behavior of guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11647)|
| 3:14:17| Now that may get a little iffy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| It's similar to our thing with the beer board, when we ask them to tell us how they're going to enforce the beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11659)|
| 3:14:27| So something, and I don't want to put this in, I don't want to codify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11667)|
| 3:14:32| I would like this to be part of the application process, so that those questions are asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11672)|
| 3:14:36| Just like MPC asks, as I understand, when a developer comes to develop something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11676)|
| 3:14:42| have you talked to the surrounding neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11682)|
| 3:14:46| That's not enforceable, but it is certainly something that needs to be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11686)|
| 3:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11691)|
| 3:14:52| Vice Mayor Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11694)|
| 3:14:56| I didn't, I don't, a point of order, I suppose, is that I've made a motion, and these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11696)|
| 3:15:05| it's been seconded, and these items that we're talking about being a part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11705)|
| 3:15:10| is it out of order that maybe Will has written these up and that we look at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11710)|
| 3:15:16| and send them around to council tomorrow to make sure we've covered what everyone has wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11716)|
| 3:15:20| or what would be the proper procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| I want to make sure that each one of you have your information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11722)|
| 3:15:26| And so, Will, do you feel comfortable that you got everyone's, I mean, what should we do here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11726)|
| 3:15:34| This is a little bit different than what we've ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| It's like a transcript from the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11736)|
| 3:15:37| Can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11737)|
| 3:15:38| We can do a transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| I just want to make sure that all of these comments, which are all good, are part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11740)|
| 3:15:45| But we couldn't add to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11745)|
| 3:15:49| No, but we just make sure we've covered what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| I don't want to leave anyone out of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11752)|
| 3:15:55| So would that be proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| Yeah, because I'm sure Mr. Johnson intends to create an accurate record that's forwarded to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11757)|
| 3:16:06| that lists, you know, what each member of council has requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11766)|
| 3:16:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11770)|
| 3:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11771)|
| 3:16:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11772)|
| 3:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11773)|
| 3:16:14| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11774)|
| 3:16:15| So, keeping in mind, you're giving MPC a month to consider all of those things you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11775)|
| 3:16:22| And Mr. Kelly, when do you have to have your recommendation ready for your planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11782)|
| 3:16:28| in order to get on the October meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11788)|
| 3:16:34| We're calling on Mr. Kelly right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| Hold on just a second, Carly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11796)|
| 3:16:40| You weren't planning to take the holiday, were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11800)|
| 3:16:43| Well, I would suggest since the law department is the one that originally drafted this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11803)|
| 3:16:49| maybe they should take these suggestions and submit them to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11809)|
| 3:16:54| Let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11814)|
| 3:16:57| The timing for getting on the October agenda, we could place an ad that would be rather generic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11817)|
| 3:17:08| but the actual ordinance itself, the longer that we can have it done and have it out for public review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11828)|
| 3:17:16| the better off we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11836)|
| 3:17:20| I guess the first thing I need to ask, and you all may have been talking with Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11840)|
| 3:17:28| and he may have an understanding of what it is you're actually wanting us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11848)|
| 3:17:33| Are you wanting us to write a new ordinance with these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11853)|
| 3:17:37| or do you want to take a laundry list of stuff the planning commission can go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11857)|
| 3:17:42| do you think there ought to be an R1 and R1E, yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11862)|
| 3:17:46| Is that what you're wanting, or are you wanting an actual amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11866)|
| 3:17:51| And this is a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11871)|
| 3:17:56| Typically a map reflects the adopted ordinance, not the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11876)|
| 3:18:02| You don't do a map and then do the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11882)|
| 3:18:04| You do the ordinance and then draw a map to fit the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11884)|
| 3:18:09| Because you're asking MPC to do in a few weeks what the law department has done in months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11889)|
| 3:18:15| reviewing all of these and coming up with some proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| That's just the reality of what you're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11898)|
| 3:18:21| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11901)|
| 3:18:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11904)|
| 3:18:26| I think that what council would like for you to do in the ideal is come up with a perfect ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11906)|
| 3:18:33| and come back with an ordinance that everybody is going to agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11913)|
| 3:18:38| Very unlikely to happen in the next month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11918)|
| 3:18:42| But in the absence of that, what they want to do is they want you to get back to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11922)|
| 3:18:51| with whatever it is that you all decide to propose, one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11931)|
| 3:18:56| just so we can, in the record, see that you have considered all of these things that are said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11936)|
| 3:19:02| Then council, after being able to show on the record that all of these things have been considered by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11942)|
| 3:19:11| council will then take the reins of this process and ultimately come up with the final ordinance based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11951)|
| 3:19:20| Would one option be to take the existing ordinance and the information that has been asked for here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11960)|
| 3:19:27| and the planning commission come back and say, we think what you've got right now is perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11967)|
| 3:19:33| You did that once already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11973)|
| 3:19:36| So at that point, they would have considered every item on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11976)|
| 3:19:40| This is something we can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11980)|
| 3:19:43| How does that help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| It's been amended as we wish, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11985)|
| 3:19:48| Because it's really our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11988)|
| 3:19:50| My final thought tonight is I don't have the authority to commit to doing this prior to getting it back to city council on November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=11990)|
| 3:20:02| Given the list of things that you have done, that would be a formal work task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12002)|
| 3:20:11| I can't commit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12011)|
| 3:20:14| What I will say is when the recorder's office supplies us with a copy of the meeting information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12014)|
| 3:20:23| I will submit and give that to Mr. Green, and we will make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12023)|
| 3:20:28| or he will make a decision as to what kind of time frame we can address the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12028)|
| 3:20:34| Speaking with the law director, we will commit city staff to assist you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12034)|
| 3:20:40| They already have looked at all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12040)|
| 3:20:41| They understand what they've just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12041)|
| 3:20:45| So perhaps we can help you package it in a way that MPC can consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12045)|
| 3:20:51| so that it's at least on the record it's been looked at by your commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12051)|
| 3:20:55| Does that sound right, Mr. Waldron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12055)|
| 3:20:58| Krista, do you feel that bus rolling over top of you now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12058)|
| 3:21:01| Mayor, it's sort of like the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12061)|
| 3:21:04| Remember, we came with ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12064)|
| 3:21:06| Oh, don't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12066)|
| 3:21:07| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12067)|
| 3:21:08| We'll meet back in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12068)|
| 3:21:09| The difference on this is it's a land use issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| and MPC, they are charged with making recommendations on land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12071)|
| 3:21:17| and to put them under that tight guideline that they have to get back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12077)|
| 3:21:21| and have it on back in November without him giving ample ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12081)|
| 3:21:24| that takes really the responsibility out of his hands to really give it much due diligence at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12084)|
| 3:21:30| I'm not sure that that is in the long‑term best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12090)|
| 3:21:33| I mean, I know what your plan is is to try to get it done before you leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12093)|
| 3:21:36| but is that the long‑term best for the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| have the best ordinance for us to live with now and forevermore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12098)|
| 3:21:43| I think rushing it is not necessarily what's best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12103)|
| 3:21:47| and I think you need to strip out the time just to give MPC to rush it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12107)|
| 3:21:53| I would ask MPC to take it, review it, give it serious consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12113)|
| 3:21:59| and bring it back to us and what they really think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12119)|
| 3:22:02| as opposed to just returning it and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12122)|
| 3:22:04| well, okay, we considered it and it's right back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12124)|
| 3:22:06| That did us no good other than to appease the statute, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12126)|
| 3:22:12| that we can't make substantive changes without it being heard by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12132)|
| 3:22:17| And I think you're taking a big part of the public process out of it when you do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12137)|
| 3:22:22| And we're sitting up here, like the signed ordinance, and we're crafting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12142)|
| 3:22:25| Do I have five votes for this or that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| And I think you'd have a better ordinance if you'd let MPC really weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12147)|
| 3:22:33| Well, you know, you only have to take one term off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12153)|
| 3:22:36| So when you come back and get reelected in four years and we're still working on it, you can frame counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12156)|
| 3:22:44| Let's get it right as opposed to rushing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12164)|
| 3:22:46| A little bit about what is he doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12166)|
| 3:22:48| So Ms. Malone has been here for three and a half hours, so I'm going to take the liberty and call on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12168)|
| 3:22:54| I appreciate that, Mayor. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12176)|
| 3:23:01| One correction, Councilman Della Vopi kept talking about R1 and R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12181)|
| 3:23:06| and then Mr. Johnson said there was going to be a verbatim transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12186)|
| 3:23:10| R1E, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12190)|
| 3:23:11| Thank you. That was the correction I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12191)|
| 3:23:14| Second of all, I think whatever you direct Mr. Kelly, who said he was not going down alone on any issue here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12194)|
| 3:23:28| in the directions to him from council, I think it ought to be all the ideas that council has come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12208)|
| 3:23:33| that you would like MPC to look at and additionally leave open the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12213)|
| 3:23:38| as I think Councilman Wallace is suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12218)|
| 3:23:40| for MPC to bring in any other idea that their expertise provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12220)|
| 3:23:51| for the improvement of our community and the improvement of the decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| So it would be everything that was mentioned here plus whatever important things they think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12236)|
| 3:24:01| ought to be returned to council as part of their deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12245)|
| 3:24:06| You're saying let them give us a workable plan that they think is good land-use planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12246)|
| 3:24:11| Well, let them talk about all of the things you guys mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| and additionally anything else that comes to mind that might not have come from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12255)|
| 3:24:22| but might be part of their expertise as professional planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12262)|
| 3:24:26| who are involved with a whole host of other land-use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12266)|
| 3:24:31| So it would be all of this included but not limited to kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12271)|
| 3:24:38| Just for the record, when somebody said that we need public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| I would clarify that to say if you want additional public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12281)|
| 3:24:45| there has been a lot of public process to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| So just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| Well, I don't mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| I'm trying to belabor the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| But, I mean, when you add all these amendments in that have not had any public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12294)|
| 3:24:58| they've been thrown out as suggestions, I think it would be prudent to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12298)|
| 3:25:04| Yeah, I mean, I would just say that a lot of this was discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| during the public process over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| But, you know, we have as much public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12311)|
| 3:25:17| We will continue to have as much public process as you need in order to make your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12317)|
| 3:25:23| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12323)|
| 3:25:24| Okay, so the question is, so we have a motion and a second to refer this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12324)|
| 3:25:31| And Dan's pretty excited, I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12331)|
| 3:25:35| Is that part of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12335)|
| 3:25:36| That's part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12336)|
| 3:25:38| To consider all of those items that are now in the record for them to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12338)|
| 3:25:45| Is that enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12345)|
| 3:25:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12346)|
| 3:25:47| As well as anything they want to add from their best judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12347)|
| 3:25:51| And anything else you want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12351)|
| 3:25:54| Can we take things away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12354)|
| 3:25:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12357)|
| 3:25:58| I mean, you might come back with a one-sentence thing, no STRs, and then we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12358)|
| 3:26:04| Don't make it that easy on him, Dan, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12364)|
| 3:26:07| Mayor, could we recognize Patty, Ms. Barrier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12367)|
| 3:26:13| I think she's wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12373)|
| 3:26:15| Are you just standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12375)|
| 3:26:16| Patty, did you want to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12376)|
| 3:26:18| Okay, if you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12378)|
| 3:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| Sorry, I know in all your lists, and you mentioned R1, R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12381)|
| 3:26:29| But there is also SW1, which is actually in the ordinance, the drafted ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12389)|
| 3:26:36| It is residential to have that included also within the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12396)|
| 3:26:40| Sorry, Nick, I should have addressed that with you, but the list started over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12400)|
| 3:26:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12405)|
| 3:26:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12408)|
| 3:26:49| Okay, so anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| We did have the part about it, requesting that they have this back to us by November 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12411)|
| 3:26:57| Try to have it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| Right, we'd like it back by Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12419)|
| 3:27:04| To give us ample time for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12424)|
| 3:27:07| I know the hour is late, but, you know, we have never heard from Peter Ahrens as to what he thinks is enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12427)|
| 3:27:16| And I still think that's the big flaw in this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12436)|
| 3:27:23| Let me say, what is enforceable, what he believes is enforceable is in the proposed ordinance that we've given you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12443)|
| 3:27:32| Well, if a complaint is made that that's not being done, then he enforces, otherwise he doesn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12452)|
| 3:27:37| You're talking about outside of the regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12457)|
| 3:27:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12460)|
| 3:27:43| I mean, you've got, what, a $3 million budget, and you've got the whole city to look at for a whole lot of different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12463)|
| 3:27:49| including dirty lots and, you know, misuse of zoning codes and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12469)|
| 3:27:55| What is it that's a practical enforcement scenario, just pass a law and wait for a complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12475)|
| 3:28:03| Or do we have some process, and I know you talked at one time, or maybe Krista did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12483)|
| 3:28:08| about doing some software analysis of what Airbnb and other companies might have as a listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12488)|
| 3:28:15| But what's a practical enforcement scheme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12495)|
| 3:28:18| Because that seems to be the flaw here that we just don't seem to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12498)|
| 3:28:23| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12503)|
| 3:28:24| Peter Ahrens, Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12504)|
| 3:28:28| I believe what you have before you today is enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12508)|
| 3:28:33| We have talked with a third-party vendor that can coordinate with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12513)|
| 3:28:38| and actually does a lot of the legwork on the front end, which gives us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12518)|
| 3:28:45| and we would expect probably 70 percent compliance voluntarily, so it's 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12525)|
| 3:28:51| It's a limited number of short-term rentals that would be out of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12531)|
| 3:28:58| and the staff that we have right now are quality, and they're up to the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12538)|
| 3:29:04| And they know that it's coming, and we're pretty flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12544)|
| 3:29:09| We understand that there's a lot of effort that's been put into this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12549)|
| 3:29:14| As far as enforceability, there are thresholds in there as far as being owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12554)|
| 3:29:23| We can track that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| We can verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12565)|
| 3:29:28| Can we verify if they live there, if they're on-site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12568)|
| 3:29:33| As Vice Mayor Grieve was saying, if somebody is on-site during the rental, that sounds good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12573)|
| 3:29:40| but we can't enforce that because we're not going to be renting it with them, and we're not going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12580)|
| 3:29:46| There's no process where they have to come for each rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12586)|
| 3:29:50| so you don't know who's home and who isn't and who's showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12590)|
| 3:29:54| It would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12594)|
| 3:29:55| How about numbers of people in an STR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12595)|
| 3:29:58| I mean, whether it's four or six or 12, how does anyone know who's in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12598)|
| 3:30:04| That would be something that would be complaint-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12604)|
| 3:30:07| It would have to be complaint-driven by the neighbors, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| Yes, we would anticipate with the ordinance that's before you now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12609)|
| 3:30:12| they identify the number of bedrooms, the total occupancy, and that's spelled out as you saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12612)|
| 3:30:17| And then if there is a complaint, we would actually go out and look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12617)|
| 3:30:24| So that would be the trigger for you, mostly complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12624)|
| 3:30:26| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12626)|
| 3:30:27| You'd have the third-party vendor identifying noncompliant listings, and then you'd have the complaint-driven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12627)|
| 3:30:33| They would identify all of the listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12635)|
| 3:30:37| They would identify the listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12637)|
| 3:30:41| They would basically go through the whole registration process, getting all the legwork ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12641)|
| 3:30:48| We would have our verification that what they say is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12648)|
| 3:30:53| And as far as the number of occupants at a specific time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12653)|
| 3:31:02| You're never going to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12662)|
| 3:31:04| It's going to be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12664)|
| 3:31:06| What about the most of this stuff is going to happen on weekends and you're all going to be at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12666)|
| 3:31:11| unless you have weekend crews that are going out checking STRs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12671)|
| 3:31:18| We would verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12678)|
| 3:31:20| We would go and check the listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12680)|
| 3:31:22| If somebody comes to us and gets a permit and they say, well, we've got two bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12682)|
| 3:31:28| we're going to have a total occupancy of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12688)|
| 3:31:32| And then we get a complaint that, hey, there's 16 cars at this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12692)|
| 3:31:36| Well, we would go and we would verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12696)|
| 3:31:38| We would look at the listing that they have that they're advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| And if they're advertising for more than four but they've pulled a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12701)|
| 3:31:47| we would show the discrepancy and then we would follow up accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12707)|
| 3:31:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12711)|
| 3:31:52| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12712)|
| 3:31:54| Vice Mayor Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12714)|
| 3:31:55| I called the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12719)|
| 3:32:00| So we have a motion and a second, as I previously said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12720)|
| 3:32:04| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12724)|
| 3:32:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12726)|
| 3:32:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12727)|
| 3:32:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12728)|
| 3:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12729)|
| 3:32:10| That will be referred back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| Council, I do want to so the person who signed up for public forum gave up on us and he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12733)|
| 3:32:21| I do want to tell you I got a text from Stan Sharp, from our fire chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12741)|
| 3:32:25| to say we received a request to send a swift water team, one boat and six firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12745)|
| 3:32:31| to Texas to assist with water rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12751)|
| 3:32:35| The mission calls for our team to be at TEMA in Nashville tomorrow at 1400 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12755)|
| 3:32:40| and to then travel to Texas for an eight-day deployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12760)|
| 3:32:44| We're preparing them to deploy in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=12764)|
