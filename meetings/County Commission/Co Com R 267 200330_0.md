| 0:00:31| Good afternoon and welcome to the March meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=31)|
| 0:00:37| Before I call roll, I'd like to reference an order by Bill Lee, Governor of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=37)|
| 0:00:45| This is Executive Order Number 16 issued by Governor Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| It's an order ensuring government continues to function openly and transparently during the COVID-19 emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| while taking appropriate measures to protect the health and safety of citizens and government officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=57)|
| 0:01:04| Without going into great detail on the order, the order will remain in effect until 12.01 a.m. Central Daylight Time on May 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=64)|
| 0:01:14| at which time the suspension of any state laws or rules may be authorized back to Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| TCA Section 58-2-118 shall cease and be of no longer force in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| This order from Governor Lee was to allow municipal bodies such as county commissions and city councils and other legislative bodies to meet electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=86)|
| 0:01:37| And because of this order, that is why we are now conducting our meeting thanks to the Zoom application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=97)|
| 0:01:45| Before we jump into tonight's agenda, I do first of all want to thank all of my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| and the many folks in Knox County government who have worked hard to make this possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=111)|
| 0:01:57| So much thanks to County IT, to our friends at CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| It's been, granted we're not at the end of the meeting yet, but it's been a lot of work over the last week behind the scenes to help bring this to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=122)|
| 0:02:11| So thank you to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| So with that said, I'd like to pass the meeting to Angie and the County Clerk's Office to call roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=133)|
| 0:02:23| Commissioner Gill? Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Commissioner Carringer? Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| Commissioner Smith? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Commissioner Anders? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| Commissioner Bassler? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| Commissioner Beeler? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| Commissioner Daly? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Commissioner Jay? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Commissioner Biggs? Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| All members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| I know none of us ever thought that when we left last month's meeting that we would be in the middle of something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| So at this time I wanted to thank Mayor Jacobs and Mayor Buchanan, Dr. Buchanan, our Sheriff's Office, and all of the first responders for acting so quickly and for your leadership during this unprecedented time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=192)|
| 0:03:30| And the other day I was going through some devotions and I came across one from Pastor Max Locato, and it really spoke to me during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=210)|
| 0:03:45| He said, in times like these, it is easy to let fear grip our hearts. Fear of sickness and fear of loss. Fear of the unknown. But when fear and anxiety try to invade our every thought, there is a calm that comes only from God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=225)|
| 0:04:02| If you ever wonder about your ability to fight fear, remember there is a pathway out of the valley of worry. God used the pen of Paul to sketch the map with the most underlined verse in the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=242)|
| 0:04:18| Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand. Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication. With Thanksgiving, let your requests be known to God and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=258)|
| 0:04:43| We'll guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus, which is found in Philippians 4, 4-6. Could you use some calm? We could all use a word of comfort and God is ready to give it. It is not God's will that you lead a life of perpetual anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=283)|
| 0:05:05| He has made you for more than the season of breath, stilling angst and mind-splitting worry. With his help, you can sleep better tonight. You can refrain from the way you face your fears. By his power, you can be anxious for nothing and discover the peace which passes all understanding. Will you all bow your head and join me in a short prayer, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=305)|
| 0:05:31| Dear Lord, you spoke to storms. Would you speak to ours? You calmed the hearts of the apostles. Would you calm the chaos within us? You told them to fear not. Say the same to us. We are weary from our worry, battered from the gales of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=331)|
| 0:05:55| O Prince of Peace, bequeath to us a spirit of calm, quench anxiety, stir courage, and let us know less fret and more faith. And it's your most precious name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=355)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer. Next, Commissioner Jay, would you please lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| I would say normally stand up, but well, all we're going to get is okay. All right. I'm going to just turn around and offer a salute and I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=378)|
| 0:06:48| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. I'm glad you brought your own flag, but that's great. So next on the agenda is public forum. We've asked any members of the public that would like to address any item on the commission agenda tonight to please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=408)|
| 0:07:15| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer. I'm glad you brought your own flag, but that's great. So next on the agenda is public forum. We've asked any members of the public that would like to address any item on the commission agenda tonight to please send their emails to commission at knoxcounty.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| That's our general commission email address. However, if in your email you note that it isn't related to something that is specific to tonight's agenda, we'll make sure that those emails are, well, they're always distributed to the commissioners, but we'll also make that emails that come in response to tonight's agenda are included in the clerk's records of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=443)|
| 0:07:44| For tonight, I've asked, as part of public forum, Mayor Jacobs to provide us with a general update to the county's response to the COVID-19 situation. So I will recognize Mayor Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=464)|
| 0:08:01| Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate it. Thank you all for being here and dealing with this and the technology involved. First of all, I'd like to thank Dr. Buchanan and the health department, as well as the area hospitals and medical providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=481)|
| 0:08:18| They've all come together in an unprecedented fashion to address this issue. And Dr. B and her staff have, they're working very hard and a lot of long hours. So we appreciate everything that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=498)|
| 0:08:35| Thus far, we've had 57 cases of coronavirus identified and confirmed in Knox County. Tragically, over the weekend, we had experienced our first death. I think we all realize that these numbers will increase, unfortunately, but that's the situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=515)|
| 0:08:55| The county is paying for some testing for uninsured at the health department for COVID-19. You do have to meet the criteria set forth, and Dr. B can explain that. We have seen an increase in suicides. I'm sure you all saw the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=535)|
| 0:09:14| Please keep the folks at the Regional Forensic Center in your prayers and thinking about them, because they see things and experience things that the rest of us don't even want to imagine, and they deal with that on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=554)|
| 0:09:26| Knox County has implemented our contingency plan, so those employees who can't work from home are working from home as much as possible. All of our offices and departments are utilizing skeleton crews so we can keep people at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=566)|
| 0:09:40| The city county building is limiting visitors, as well as their satellite offices, such as the trustee and the registrar's offices. Where possible, we are cross-utilizing employees. For instance, Dr. B Cannon may be calling upon library personnel to help answer phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=580)|
| 0:09:58| The health department and parks and rec and other departments have been helping the CAC deliver mobile meals. Libraries and senior centers are closed until further notice. Greenways and parks are open, but playgrounds and restrooms are closed as of today, and we encourage people, despite the fact that the greenways and parks are open, we still encourage people to practice responsible social distancing if they do decide to go out and utilize those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=598)|
| 0:10:25| Governor Lee issued an executive order allowing virtual meetings of public bodies, such as this one, which the chairman mentioned. I'd like to thank Zach Webb and IT. They have done an extraordinary and excellent job of working with all the various bodies who have to have public meetings and ensuring that those still go on virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=625)|
| 0:10:46| We are very concerned about the strain that COVID-19 will put on the county social services and our nonprofit partners. The emergency operations center has been activated with a focus on helping in these areas. I have some notes here from Sharon Shanks, who is our community initiatives officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=646)|
| 0:11:02| Senior citizens, the CAC is doing a great job coordinating with volunteers in East Tennessee. Their office of aging is business as usual. Mobile meals is going to five days or five meals once a week delivery in order to cut down on people being out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=662)|
| 0:11:22| They are also in communication with the food policy council and how they may be able to assist with supply chain folks and local grocery stores to secure food for seniors. Homelessness, the homeless providers in our community are working diligently to keep themselves, the homeless community, and our community at large safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=682)|
| 0:11:41| They are currently in deep discussion of opening two emergency holding shelters. One is for folks pending test results and the other for anyone that has tested positive. Metro drug coalition's new facility and car have both offered up their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=701)|
| 0:11:54| Feeding seems to be okay. Health and hygiene, of course, is always a concern and even more so now. When it comes to youth and families, great school partnership and Knox County schools are feeding students three days a week at 25 sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=714)|
| 0:12:10| The need to deliver food to folks that do not have transportation to these distribution sites is a topic of conversation and concern. We've also seen area nonprofits and churches that have pop-up food distribution sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=730)|
| 0:12:25| The emergency operations center, all duties in the emergency operations center have been assigned and we're meeting virtually twice a day to update the team on any new developments or action items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=745)|
| 0:12:35| The EOC has also established what's called a joint information center. You all as elected officials should be receiving communications out of that office, which is the center with Knox County and the city of Knoxville through the EOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=755)|
| 0:12:54| The resources that people can utilize, of course, one that has been set up for folks who would like to volunteer is volunteeretn.org. So we encourage people who want to find out about volunteer opportunities in the community to go there, volunteeretn.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=774)|
| 0:13:13| And folks that are in need of social services, please call 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| A week ago, Dr. Buchanan issued a safer at home order, which required non-essential businesses to close, specifically focusing on businesses that by their nature put their clientele at risk of transmission of this virus, which is personal appearance, businesses like hair salons, barber shops, nail salons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=799)|
| 0:13:35| The order also encourages Knox County to stay at home and practice social distancing as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| Of course, today, Governor Lee issued a similar order. Bars are closed. Restaurants are open only for takeout and delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| Governor Lee mentioned something that Dr. Buchanan and I say a lot. These orders will only work if the people in our community follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| And as Governor Lee says, with personal liberty comes personal responsibility. Right now, it is our responsibility as individuals to keep the health of our neighbors and our communities top of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=836)|
| 0:14:06| And finally, obviously, this crisis is going to have a big negative impact on our current budget and our proposed budget for the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| So we're working daily with finance and also with the state to get the best possible forecast models moving forward. But we ought to keep in mind that this is changing daily and it's very fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=853)|
| 0:14:26| Okay. Thank you, Mayor Jacobs. I guess what I'll do right now is if any commissioners have a question or something for Mayor Jacobs, I'll go ahead and pull up my participant box and I'll try to recognize y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=866)|
| 0:14:52| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to make sure we all are thankful to our employees that are out there in the solid waste centers, the ones in EPW that are keeping our roads safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=896)|
| 0:15:08| those essential employees in Parks and Rec that are keeping our greenways and parks open, that we have open space, and our clerk employees who are helping to handle our daily licensing and fees and stuff that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=908)|
| 0:15:21| These people are out there doing their jobs and I greatly appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| I just have a quick question about the stay at home or safer at home order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| In all the press conferences I've seen, it's been said that it's not going to be enforced in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=943)|
| 0:15:54| How is it going to work if some businesses decide to stay open, even if it's under an order to close and if we're not enforcing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=954)|
| 0:16:03| Are there plans to do enforcement in any way, shape, or form, or is it we're just hoping for the best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| Well, Dr. Buchanan can address this. For the businesses that the health department has purview over, they can, of course, essentially revoke their licenses, which are the restaurants and the hair salons, I believe, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=969)|
| 0:16:25| A lot of this seriously is, unless the sheriff is going to go out, we're going to have to rely on businesses to self-police and comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=985)|
| 0:16:41| And it's the same with individuals. There's only so much we can do in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| So, as far as what the health department has purview over, it can be enforced that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| And otherwise, in many cases, it's going to be up to individuals and businesses to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| Just a quick follow-up. Does the sheriff's office have a position on that, or have they had any indication of, are they going to do any enforcement, or are they in the loop on the same order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1019)|
| 0:17:10| Commissioner, there's no enforcement to that, but we're keeping an eye on it, and I'm sure that myself and the attorney general will probably meet just to see if there is anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1030)|
| 0:17:23| But as of right now, it's pretty much just an advisement that we can go and say, hey, you need to be able to do this, or whatever it is you need to do to comply. But that's about all that we can do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1043)|
| 0:17:33| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Has that got your question? All right. Commissioner Smith, your hand is still up. Do you have a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1053)|
| 0:17:50| No, sir. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Okay. Now we're at the part on our agenda where we do need to set the agenda for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| Obviously, this has got to be a little bit different, and as a reminder, we do need to conduct everything that we vote on is going to be done via a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1081)|
| 0:18:12| So thanks again in advance to our county clerks who are helping us with tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| What I'm proposing is we'll probably do this through a couple of different votes to get tonight's agenda set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| You know, we did not have, and for the general public who may be watching this meeting, historically, County Commission usually has two meetings a month, where the week before this particular meeting, we will have completed a work session where we take a first initial pass through the agenda, do a lot of debate on a bunch of different items, and then do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1104)|
| 0:18:47| Some items are sent forward to tonight's meeting for actual additional debate and vote, and some items are covered in a work session, are put on something called a consent agenda, which are either non-controversial items or things that we completely debated at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1127)|
| 0:19:04| And then from an efficiency point of view, we'll have one vote on these consent items so that you don't have to take a long, especially with roll call votes, have a long, you know, drawn out voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1144)|
| 0:19:16| Obviously, because we canceled our work session, we don't have that, although I did propose a suggested series of consent agendas on our commissioner's forum prior to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1156)|
| 0:19:27| So, with that said, to begin to build to our consent agenda and the items that we'll go over tonight, the first vote I'd like to have is going to be to vote on the items that we're going to add to the agenda, to the items that are going to be subtracted from the agenda, and the items that are basically in advance of the COVID-19 situation were to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1167)|
| 0:19:55| We'll also probably, I do want to add one item, which is a discussion on, not a discussion, but we'll do this via the forum is scheduling of a public hearing, which we'll do during the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1195)|
| 0:20:08| So, for y'all to consider tonight, we, for this first vote, we do need to vote to add items 28 and 29 to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1208)|
| 0:20:19| When they are added to the agenda, they will not be placed on the consent part of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| Secondly, for the use of you watching at home, item 26 will be removed from the agenda to be considered next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1227)|
| 0:20:40| Additionally, after conferring with the clerk's office, the clerk's office would like us to briefly hear the notary applications and the minutes so that we can get that done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1240)|
| 0:20:55| Finally, item 22, which was on the agenda when it was printed, was an item that was requested by the sponsor in advance before we moved the electronic format, was an item that was to be deferred as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1255)|
| 0:21:12| So, Angie or Kim, does that cover all those items that we discussed that we needed to kind of cover in this first vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| The chairman will entertain a motion for approval of these items and we can, or if there's any additional items for this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1285)|
| 0:21:36| These, once again, are the items that we're going to add, subtract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| This is the first. The other items that I proposed to be either on consent or non-consent, we'll get to those next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| So, could I have a, I recognize Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Commissioner Daley with a, your hand is up. I'm going to assume that's a motion. Just nod and could I have a second, please, either through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1311)|

| 0:22:14| Okay. All right. Well, all right. Then I will move that on the next round. All right. Thank you, Commissioner Daley. We'll move that to next month, but I'm going to handle that vote on the next vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1334)|
| 0:22:27| If that's okay with you. So, this first one is just kind of the housekeeping to decide the issues that we'll be voting on tonight. So, if you're good with that. So, once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1347)|
| 0:22:38| This is to formally add items 28 and 29 to remove item 26 to make sure that we vote on the minutes and the notaries and to defer item 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1358)|
| 0:22:52| Commissioner Daley has made a first and is there a second on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1378)|

| 0:23:05| Okay. So, we have a first and a second on setting this part of the agenda. Madam Clerk, would you call a roll call vote, please? Everybody, if you've got as a reminder, have your finger over the space bar so that you can chime in if you've got your microphones on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1385)|

| 0:24:17| Anybody wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| It appears it was unanimously passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| So that part of the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| So the next part on our agenda for us to consider is I proposed a consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| agenda online and there were so and Commissioner Daly you had just told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| that I think it was item 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| You had said on the forum to consider pulling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| But based on your statement earlier we'll go ahead and leave that to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| postponed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Did you say April or May to the May meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| May is fine Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| And then we will go through I think the other item Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| And by the way here's what I'm proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Any of these items that we would like to have pulled back onto the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| from my proposed consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| I'd like to do that with just a vote of six votes just to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| I think Commissioner the others on here is we've got Commissioner Bessler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1514)|
| 0:25:23| has recommended items 19 and 20 to be pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| So I'd like to put those on the floor for a vote to be pulled from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| and with six votes we'll pull that off of my proposed consent agenda and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| handle that discussion on that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| So I'll go ahead and Madam Clerk would you go ahead and just call a roll on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| And to restate this this is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Yeah I do need a motion so I need a motion to pull items 19 and 20 from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| the proposed consent agenda to the regular agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| And that would just require six votes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| And I recognize Commissioner Carson daily with a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| And is there a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| And that Commissioner Gill with the second on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| So we have a first and second unless there needs to be debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| We can go ahead and proceed to a vote on this one unless my fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| commissioners would like to debate adding this one to the floor for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| tonight's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| The chair working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| I think the question is is is this anything different from what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| already voted on previously or is this just the contract from the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| in which we've already voted on the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1614)|
| 0:27:02| Well the Commissioner Anders posed a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| Once again I don't think we're right to the point of debating the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| We're debating whether we want to pull it on to for for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| But I know that Chris Caldwell did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Did you want to weigh in briefly to answer Commissioner Anders question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| and Commissioner Anders would you restate your question please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| Well I'm really whether or not we pull it off or not determines on if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| it's anything new or if it's just the contracts that what we voted on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| concept before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| I mean is this is this just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| It's signing the checks and the contracts or is this something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| different than we voted on previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| I can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| The chair recognizes Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| What these are are just appropriations for once the contracts have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| signed and everything is closed then it's appropriating funds to start the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| project one for buying or buying the garage and replace garage and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| other is to start the build out of the of the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| So it's basically just an appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| We have a motion and a second to pull this item from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Thank you Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| I think for the record when people are making motions you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| recognize them and they need to state their name and the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| We'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| We will make sure that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| For this one I believe the motion was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Was that Commissioner Daly with the second by Commissioner Gill to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| this one from the proposed consent agenda and put on the agenda for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| So we as that is a motion that still is up for debate until we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| vote on the debate would actually be on the actual motion itself and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| So if you vote yes for this motion that is before you you're voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| You'd like to pull this from the consent agenda to have some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| If you vote no on this you're saying you'd rather keep this on the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| And I'm looking to see if there's any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| I see no additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Oh sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Commissioner Gill you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Thank you Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| This is Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| The motion is to have a discussion or remove it from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| The person who requested that is Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| Does he have any reasoning why it should not be on consent that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| clarified at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| I'd be happy to speak to the issue if you want to do it now or do it as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| discussion item so we can work this thing out about the appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1812)|
| 0:30:22| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| So Commissioner would you like to go ahead and just weigh in on Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Gill's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| The reason why I was looking at this and commissioners were all concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| about what's going on and there's two big issues that's going before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| The first issue is the concern of COVID-19 and how we're handling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| The next issue is how it's affecting the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| We've got information from I guess Chris Caldwell on how this is affecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| tax taxes and how we're getting taxes in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| And it seems like we're appropriating some money down the road could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| used to help fortify our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| This is not a necessity that we have to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| We haven't signed contracts on the buildings yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| We haven't done anything that would cause us to appropriate money that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| would take it out of the general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| And it doesn't seem like it's well say in the scheme of things the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| of money we're doing but that's almost six million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| And the tax that we're getting now for schools for roads and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| else continues to go really south which it looks like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Then we should probably hold up on the appropriation till we find out how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| the economy is going to be like in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| We won't know till we get some feedback four or five months down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| And if it gets so low what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| We've already appropriated the money that we're going to spend it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| something that right now is not a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| The necessity is fighting the virus and making sure that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| the virus and making sure the economy sound enough to where we can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| people when we need to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| And that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| I'm not saying we do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| I'm just saying let's postpone it and see what the economy is going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| and what the virus is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| And we we haven't even reached the peak of what the virus is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| And we sure haven't reached the bottom of where the economy is going to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| So I'm just asking for us to be more vigilant of the taxpayers dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| and the people that are supplying those dollars are out of jobs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| All the people that we will hurt the most are the ones that are the weakest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| in the economy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| And those are the ones working day by day living by checkbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| So I'm just asking us for defer this appropriation till we can get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| information about what's going to be like in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| And we can't do that until we get those revenues, how they're going and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| how they're coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| That's all I'm asking to do is to defer this item till we get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| information about the economy and virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| I would like to ask Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| This is the appropriation of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| There are several and probably many opportunities now between now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| actually closing the deal that we still have outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| We don't think that closing will happen until probably early May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| And so there are still plenty of times, plenty of time for I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| could say either side to walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| I would say that for us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| while we are watching the economy very closely, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| I don't think that's a reason to walk away from this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2052)|
| 0:34:20| I would say that if we get into it and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| we see that we may want to fund it a different way, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| But I think as we sit right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| the about 2.8 million of the total amount that we're talking about are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| from premiums of bonds that we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| And so ultimately that's money that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| We're basically talking about an additional 3 million from the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| And Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| those premiums of bonds have to be used on the capital project and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| analysis we have says that laying out this three to $4 million right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| 5 million will save us many millions over the next coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| Yeah, that is correct. And you're spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| I think ultimately to what's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| what's strange in this as we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| as we move on is we actually got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| we issued bonds the last time the refunding was at a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| If you look today or rates on bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| if we were to go to market or higher now, which is very ironic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| but ultimately those premiums have to be used for a capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| And we feel this would be the appropriate needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Mr. Smith. I think Mr. Buster is your hand still up or is that a raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| We're kind of sending a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| We are responsible through the commission for the future responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| of taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| There's people that are losing jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| I've just met three other people that lost their jobs Friday that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| pretty secure jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| but it was these things that were shutting down to keep people from getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| in those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Some people are in some of the workout facilities and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| that we're shutting down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| They're losing their jobs and we're appropriating money for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| right now. We really don't need, he said, like may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| we probably won't know until July or August of the trending of the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| or the virus, because there's a lot more testing going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| So we're right now going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| we want appropriate money for something that we might walk away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| There's not been contracts. I don't believe signed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| So we're not walking away from it. We're just telling the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| we're watching your tax payers dimes right now by deferring it down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| a little ways to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| And we've got to have people that trust us with their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| And this is not going to be trusting us with their tax dollars by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| appropriating money that we don't even know that we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| We might have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| but in any water use funds from bonds that we set up to make additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| base to go into our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| It doesn't make sense for do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| Is this a necessary thing we have to do right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| Can we not encourage the public to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| we're trying to watch out for your tax dollars. That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| Let's show them that we are interested in their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| And that's all I'm going to say for it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| You can vote whichever way you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| but I think we need to show the public that we really mean what we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| when we're going to dig down and try to protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| All right. Thanks, commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| In order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I'll be moving to commissioner Skidmaker and then commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| And to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| when we get to the vote to vote right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| we'll be just to remove this from my proposed consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| And then we would have an actual vote on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| we're at the beginning where we're just setting the agenda right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| And I'm fine with us having this discussion right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| but I'm just as a reminder to my fellow commissioners and those who may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| be watching the meeting online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Moving on to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Could you ask commissioner Bussler to put his video feedback on so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| we can actually see him when he's talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| I thought it was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| He shows up as not not feeding a video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Is anybody else showing up on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Is he he's not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Charlie, we can't see you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| You may want to reach out to Zach or Zach needs to reach out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| I was on there just a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| Charlie, try hitting the little camera button down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| The camera buttons on the side over here and it shows that it's kicked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| But I start to remove it or to click on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2339)|
| 0:39:18| Well, it's not let me come back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Because every time I get to the camera to click on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| it says more and points that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| Well, OK, well, just Charlie, just know that I can't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| I do see you in the participant field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| So when you raise your hand, I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| I'm also seeing and I may ask Zach to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| I'm showing that your video camera is turned off when I look into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| participant field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| So, Zach, if you're listening, you may want to look in there as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| meeting host and see if you can maybe turn on Commissioner Buster's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| See if that could do something on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| That's got it fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Thank you, Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| I had to click on something else over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| We can see you now, Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Moving on back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Was that the main thing you wanted to weigh in on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Next, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Gill, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| You might turn off your mic or depress your space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| I just wanted to express a support for Commissioner Bustler because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| think his point to look at the public's trust in what the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| is doing is reflective of what the anxieties, disappointment, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| level of employment in the community and around the country people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| And whether or not we are looking at simply deferring or postponing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| motion until we can get to May would probably demonstrate to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| that we are, in fact, concerned about what we are doing as a commission as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| well as our taxpayers in terms of how their personal family economies are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| transitioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| This is really an extraordinary moment in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| And we are operating as business as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| And we might need to pause and say that we are here making sure we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| making sure we understand how our economy is connected to the greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| Knox County economy and the economy of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Looking to see if there's any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| Any other commissioners wish to weigh in on this matter before we proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| to the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Madam Clerk, I'm going to go ahead, you know, the vote to be to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| everybody what you're voting on is I suggested a consent agenda online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| This is to formally pull this matter off of the consent agenda so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| And this applies to this is really, once again, we're just setting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| formal agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| This is in regards to agenda items 19 and 20 to pull them onto the non| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| consent agenda tonight for us to have a vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| So that has been made, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| And Madam Clerk, it's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| But who made the motion in a second on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Commissioner Daly made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Commissioner Gill seconded the motion to add number 19 and number 20 to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Madam Clerk, would you please lead us in a vote on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Mr. Chairman, I have just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Commissioner Skinnecker, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Mr. Caldwell, do you need the money before May 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| When we put this on the agenda, we assume that what we would have would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| be a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Chris, if you're talking, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Oh, you may be on mute still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Is that any better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| I can hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Can you hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| When we added this to the agenda, which was early, of course, in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| we did so because the closing was tentatively going to be for April 15th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| because, as you know, the commission approved the contracts last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| So that was our goal, was as soon as closing gets done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| we wanted to be able to go ahead and start renovating our space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| because we're also working with UT now on the sub lease of their six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| And so that's why this is on the agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| I do not believe that April the 15th will be our closing date now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| I think it will probably be sometime in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| But we didn't want any gap of not being able to do work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| because UT is chomping at the bit, of course, to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| And so we're trying to keep the project going as far as the schedule goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2665)|
| 0:44:34| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2674)|
| 0:44:42| All right. I'm not seeing any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Madam Clerk, would you go ahead and do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| And once again, this is just to place this on the agenda for tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| to have a more formal vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| And once again, to restate, if you are voting yes, you're saying yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| go ahead, pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| We will have a formal vote on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| Commissioner Geale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| No, you want to keep it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Commissioner Gayle that's like Commissioner Karen ger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Yes, commissioner Charuja, that's I Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| No, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| That's now Commissioner nice for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| No, Commissioner nice for fats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Now, Commissioner memo maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Commissioner scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=2729)|

| 0:54:16| was actually not related to a specific zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| It was related to specifically the parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| I heard from two folks on the parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| that wanted to find out if that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| was gonna be a go or no go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| But otherwise, it's my understanding from Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| and I know when we spoke with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| that we sent those notices out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| and I did not get any contrary feedback from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3281)|
| 0:54:50| So, all right, so the vote has taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| but it has not been announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| It appears we had a unanimous consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| to set tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| All right, so moving on, what I'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| is I'm gonna move just a little bit through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| I'd actually like to go to the two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| that we've added to tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| which that was items 28 and 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| So the first item I'd like for us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| is item 28, which is the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| for the supportive Dr. Buchanan Safer at Home order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| So the chair will be looking for a motion for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| and a second, then we can have the follow-up discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| Chairman Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Okay, I think I saw Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| and Commissioner Smith came in at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| Everybody's talking, I think we can do hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Yeah, we'll do 909 next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| I'm sorry, what was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| I offered a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| Okay, the motion came from Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| and a second from Commissioner Gill, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| So the motion before us is item 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| which is the Safer at Home resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| What I'd ask the commissioners to help me keep track of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| if you could just kind of click on the blue hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| in the participant box before we consider this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| But I'm sure there may be some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| on this one or comments, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| In order of the blue lights right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| I haven't got anybody with a hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| I've had my hand up for like four or five minutes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| Okay, all right, sorry about that, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| Okay, so before we set the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| all I wanted you to do was go over the agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| that we are hearing tonight and that we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| because we've jumped around a lot on adding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| removing and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| Can you go over that one more time, not just for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| but for the public that may be watching at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| that is looking at the agenda on the Knox County website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Yeah, thank you and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| the participant box on my right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| it doesn't show everybody at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| so I didn't see your hand there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| It also shows Commissioner Daly's hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Okay, yeah, I'll go ahead before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| Commissioner Daly, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Just to your point, to make your job easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| to make a motion, just recognize the blue hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| and everybody not shout out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| It will be easier for you to look and recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| That, I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| So what I'll do just for the benefit of Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| I'm gonna go ahead and review the agenda briefly tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| First of all, the agenda at present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| we've approved to keep all of the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| that the school board has brought to us on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| And you've got, those are laid out on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| We've got spread of record items by the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| So all school board items will remain on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| those items were to remain on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| There are three of those four items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| are related to stormwater maintenance of facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| which is fairly routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| The towing contract, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| after speaking to purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| is more to tow Knox County vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Like if a car breaks down somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| we need to call a tow company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| That's a county vehicle to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| Those are all on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| The health department, those items are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| They, obviously we had a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| about the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| as it relates to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| The three of the four item, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| all three of those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| are related to accepting grant monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| So there are different programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| that the Knox County Health Department is involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| And three of those four grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| are related to accepting funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| from the state of Tennessee to operate their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| So moving down, Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| they had something before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| regarding the acceptance of some property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| to create a new Knox County Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| The mayor has asked that one to be postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| likely the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| The finance at items 19 and 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| they've just been pulled from the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| and will be discussed and voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| a little bit later this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Zach had an item before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| which was related to some software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| for the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| That one is still on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Juvenile court had another contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| related to receiving money from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| That one is on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| Commissioner Daley-Beegler's item 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| has been moved to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| Commissioner Jay and Biggs were supportive of the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| That item has been pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| so we will consider that one tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| Commissioner Daley's item, which was item 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| which was regarding a transfer of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| to a new account for litter control purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| that one has been moved forward to next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| for consideration, it's been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| Rules committee has been postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| Then that gets to the items that we've been added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| and the other items that will be read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| So the other business has been postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Commissioner Biggs, does that help cover everything for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Yes, sir, chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3630)|
| 1:00:30| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| So with that said, that brings us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| the only real jumping on the agenda that I plan to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| is the two items that we've added tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| are two of the most important items that we'll consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| And I'd like to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| also the line item transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| will be considered for a vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| That was in the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| and there's a very important line item transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| around follow-up from the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| from the which the flooding stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| seems like that was 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| It's been such a long few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| So with that said, I've got item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| I'd like to move items 28 and 29 to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3666)|

| 1:01:11| at the very beginning of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| So the chair would like to move to item 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| And Madam Clerk, have we already had a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| for approval in a second on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| If you could state who made the motion in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| Commissioners Jay, Commissioner Gail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Okay, is there any discussion on item 29?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| This was the support of the stay at home order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Excuse me, that's 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| That's 28, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| Unless y'all may be updated by Genesis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| I printed it out yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| this is the item related to the stay at home order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| I'd like to move that one to the top of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3713)|
| 1:02:04| We have a motion in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| On item 908, to a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| Hold on, before we do roll call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| there may be some discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| So the chair recognizes Commissioner Guild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3734)|

| 1:02:25| I just simply like to say after this resolution passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| that the commission as a body issue a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| in support of this as we began at the close of this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| And that's what I wanted to indicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3759)|

| 1:02:42| All right, and Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| I just wanted to thank everybody for signing on to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| and supporting our Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| and reinforcing that we do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| that people will be safer at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| and we should all work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| to help mitigate viral spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| So thank you very much for all jumping on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| You know, it's interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| the governor also issued this letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| You know, it's interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| the governor also issued the statewide order on that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| for the whole state this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| right when we were getting ready for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| And as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| I guess we just wanna do our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| to make sure that we're watching the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| to make sure that they have the resources that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| They're gonna be taking the lion's share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| of this work moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| So they're working their tails off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| And I know just as a general statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| in support of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| but this resolution is, it's something paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| but it's also making a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| that wanna make sure that we're doing our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| to make sure that they've got what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| So is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| Make sure I could see everybody's blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| Commissioner Jay, your hand is still up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| Okay, we have a proper motion and a second on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3842)|

| 1:05:00| Okay, the next item on the agenda I'd like us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| is the, I believe it's item 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| It's the transfer or loan item from the Hotel Motel Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| to the Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| Could I get a proper motion and a second via the hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| if possible, Commissioner Geale and Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| Commissioner Geale and Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| So we have Commissioner Geale with the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| and Commissioner Biggs with the second on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| For discussion, just light up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| I recognize Commissioner Geale, Biggs and Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| and then Daly for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Everybody's got their hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| So we'll just got to do our best to go in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| Because we are so very, I would just love to sign on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| considering the zoo is in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| But even more than that is the number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| that were laid off and the number of animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| that are left with a handful of people to care for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| It is such a priority after speaking with Elisa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| to look at how we can best serve the zoo and their staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| and the animals that they care for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| We just want to show a great deal of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| because it is just so very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| especially for the animals and the people that care for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| So hopefully within the next several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| that we'll all be past COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| But if not, we just want to express a long-term support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| for the zoo and what potentially could be occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| even after three or four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| to get that facility back online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you, Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Yeah, I mean, just to echo what Commissioner Geale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| just stated, I mean, I definitely agree with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| This is an amazing thing that we're getting ready to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| And obviously times have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| So I think that we also need to just commend Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| for everything he's doing as well and bringing this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| But we're in different times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| where basically we have our schools have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| We have parents who's just become teachers overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| Our front lines have changed with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| and first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| And this is some of the outside of the box thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| that I think we need to be doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| And I think it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| That's why I definitely seconded the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| I appreciate you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| I would like to have my name added to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| And also I was wondering if Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| would like to give us a quick overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| of his delivery of needed supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| to the zoo this afternoon for the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| Good point, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Mayor Jacobs, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Yes, the zoo has set up an emergency fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| that you can go visit to Knoxville.org, check that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| And they also, a unique way that people can help out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| is elephants like trees and brush as treats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| So with the storm that came through over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| Engineering and Public Works, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| had to clear off some roadways and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| and filled up a couple of dump trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| full of trees that they took out to the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| to feed to the elephants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| So anyone out there that's doing any yard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| or has any downed trees, give the zoo a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| They might actually be able to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| All right, thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'm gonna go through the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| but at the end of this, I may ask those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| who made the motion in a second to modify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| if everybody on commission would like to sign on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| as a sponsor on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| But next is Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| I'd like to echo the kind words from everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| And also, we have a lot of people hurting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| The hospitality industries are hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| We'll probably have some hotels, motels are closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| I don't think they'll ever open up back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| This is a trying time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| And my heart goes out, I'm getting emails and calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| from people wanting to know why they can't be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| And what do you tell them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| That is, this is, we're trading, we're playing new ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| and hopefully this will be over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| within the next two to three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| and we can get back to, I'm not gonna call it normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| because I don't think we're gonna go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| to a normal anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| So I would like to add my name to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| And everyone out there, our hearts are with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| Believe me, this whole county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| understands what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| And I wish we had the magic wand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| that we could just wave and everything would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| So God bless y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| See, next, Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| I had a couple of structural questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| about this motion from, I guess, Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| One of the questions I had about it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| are there any, have there been any terms added to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| this is being, in the motion, it's being noted as a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| And I just wondered even if there are long-term provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| are there any terms to this whatsoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| Thanks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| We, at the time when we started this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| we did not wanna put terms on it to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| I've spoken to Lisa New over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| and just broadly speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| one thing that we discussed was beginning in fiscal year 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4253)|
| 1:11:01| start a, like a 15-year repayment schedule back for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| And so that would be about $33,333 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| And our main goal is not to put them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| in any type of a hardship during that payback period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| But starting at an FY22 gives them some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| to get back on their feet and get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Okay, thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| I'm glad we have some sort of structure behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| I also, quick question, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| it was reported when this announcement first came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| from Mayor Jacobs that there was a fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| or an excess in funds or unallocated funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| in the Hotel Tour, Motel Tourism account of how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4306)|
| 1:11:53| So Hotel Motel Fund has about 1.4 million in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| And so, and that's all of the county's piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| So the Hotel Motel Fund is very restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| in what it can be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| And so we pay out everything every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| except the county's 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| And so that's just accumulated over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| So that's what we're using for this loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| And maybe, and so it brings it down a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| but ultimately that fund balance is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| because of the good job that Visit Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| has done over the years with tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Okay, thank you for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| I think this is a worthy investment in the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| It's a great economic driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| and something that our family has been very invested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| And I welcome the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| especially with some terms behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| But I also do have one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| which is if that fund balance is $1.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| and where the proposal here is to extend a loan of 500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| are we prepared for all the other entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| that are also really hurting that use the Hotel Motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| to also, I mean, we're setting a precedence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| that essentially it says we're helping one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Are we prepared to have the Arts and Cultural Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| the Beck Cultural Exchange Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| Legacy Parks, the Muse, Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Women's Basketball Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| all of those other entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| who are also really, really hurting right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| also come and ask for a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| And if that's the answer, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| We have fund balance there, don't let it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| But I just wanna say it out loud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| that if we do for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| these are all economic drivers in some way, shape or form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| and we should be prepared if they all show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| and want something probably not in a similar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| but in a similar structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| So with that, I'll close my remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| and I'd be happy to be added to the resolution as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Commissioner, if I could interject, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| Yeah, Mayor Jacobs, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| I think it's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| that the zoo is the number one tourist attraction we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| And also, we're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| that if the zoo were to close permanently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| what happens to the animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Some of these other businesses can be put on pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| and it causes a lot of hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| but I have no idea what would happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| to hundreds of exotic animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| if the zoo were to permanently close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| So I think just in a practicality standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| that puts the zoo in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| where some others probably aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| No, and I absolutely understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| that that's a different situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| when you have live animals versus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| say, a museum or some other type of structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| But I just wanted to sort of point it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| that if I was somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| that I was also really hurting in a tough economic time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| and I knew that there was a fund balance sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| that's supposed to support tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| then I certainly would open the door and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| can you help us as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| And I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| I think we should use all of our resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| that we have available to help as many people as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| And in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| it may be a designated hotel motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| that helps support certain entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| whether it be direct tourism or some other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| but we should be prepared for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| And I think this is a good use of having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| if money's sitting there and we can use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| to help support one of our great entertainment venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| and tourist attractions and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| then we should use all the tools possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| Next, the chair recognizes Commissioner Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| and then we'll probably go to Gil and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| I just wanted to say thank you for Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| and his staff for working so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| with the zoo and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| because the zoo offers so much for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| and for other counties and other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| We have one of the top zoos, I believe, in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| And my families, they're all members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| And I just want to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| for the virtual tours that you are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| My granddaughters are loving watching them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| So thank you to all our staff and all at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| All right, thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| Commissioner Gil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| Commissioner Gil, could you check your mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| I've already spoken to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| Did Commissioner Smith want to speak before me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| Yeah, sorry, yeah, I think your light was still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| I'm trying to keep them straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Yeah, go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| I turned my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| I was just going to address exactly what Mayor Jacobs did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| that live animals, large overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| It's hard to pause that kind of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| They probably have one of the largest budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| of any of our tourism industries here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| All right, thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Thank you, Commissioner Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| I asked the very question that Commissioner Jay posed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| to Chris Caldwell regarding the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| the county needs in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| That's the reason I reached out to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| some specific questions about the terms of this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| But does the county, in fact, have in place a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| or process, because what we're going to be faced with is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| I appreciate, because live animals need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| the attention and care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| This is an extraordinary opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| But what occurs, and I know the city was reaching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| to provide some financial support to the zoo as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| but what happens when additional businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| will reach out to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Have we, and this is a question for the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| as well as Chris Caldwell, looked at having a plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| or a process or a series of Q&A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| that can help potential businesses in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| And I recognize the Small Business Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| is going to be having a lot of loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| but I want to make sure we are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| or have a process in place to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| some of what is going to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| when the next three months, four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| or even nine months are at play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Commissioner, Chris Caldwell here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| Ultimately, what we've done some today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| even with the zoo, we forwarded them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| and the Women's Hospital Hall of Fame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| a link to small business loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| that's being put out through the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| and also going to be put out by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| So we will attempt to help whoever we can help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| but also we want to provide the resources necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| and get them in the right place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| as it relates to any type of assistance that can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| I think Commissioner Goff, I saw you say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| And I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| What I'd like to do, and this is a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| where you could just raise your hand in the video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| but would all the commissioners like to be a sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| of this resolution or co-sponsor with the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Commissioner Anders is there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| He came in early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| So the original makers of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| just by a nod of the heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| are you comfortable with all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| So the motion before us is in support of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| with all the commissioners as sponsors of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| So Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| call a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4783)|
| 1:19:56| Madam Clerk, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=4797)|

| 1:44:13| of the arguments that were made for the zoo. We talked about economic drivers. Mr. J had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6253)|
| 1:44:20| a lot more of economic drivers. He said we needed to also look at funding. When you appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| this money, you're taking this money out of our money that we can use to help these specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| economic drivers. And it's set aside. And we're talking about $3.975 million and $1.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6273)|
| 1:44:41| million that we're saying, okay, we're going to take this out. And we're going to move some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| offices down the street, which we've already got people in offices. And we're going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| taxpayers dollars to pay for this because the bonds that we have have been paid and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| interest has been paid by the taxpayers on their tax collection that we pay those off. Now, why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6296)|
| 1:45:02| are we setting aside money that we could possibly use quickly and fast to help other economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| businesses out? This is not a necessity right now. Why are we doing that? We're just telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6308)|
| 1:45:15| the people of Knox County that we really going to just spend this money for something that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| not a necessity that we could use to help get this economy back and help these people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6322)|
| 1:45:29| without insurance to get tested to get them back to health to help our health departments. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6329)|
| 1:45:37| don't understand why we want to do that right now. And just do just tell the taxpayers, we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| don't care about your tax money, we're just going to spend it. And that's basically what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| telling them. We're not encouraging them saying we're trying to watch out for your money. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6347)|
| 1:45:53| was my own point. I'm not saying do away with it. I'm just saying, let's don't act on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| Because once you appropriate, it's out of the out of our budget, it's appropriate for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| particular items. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| Thanks. Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. I'm going to try to see if I get these in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| order. But if Mr. Bussler, if you turn off your your light there, that'd be helpful. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6373)|

| 1:46:25| Yeah, I think that Commissioner Bussler makes some some good points. I think that the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| money is, you know, you're looking at five and a half million dollars or so. But if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| talking about jobs, and you're talking about wanting to boost the economy, I mean, all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| money is going to be spent locally with with contractors and other entities that we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| doing business with. And so in a small part, and this is kind of a another way to look at it. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6406)|
| 1:46:53| mean, it's not for us to prop up or pick winners. But I think that the fact that we are moving on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| with a small project, and for a government, this is a small project that it keeps this group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| people working. And those people are still in our economy, they're still our citizens. And, and, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| know, I trust that the mayor feels like we get too far in, I think that that is not feasible, or we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| don't have the cash flow for it. But if you look at these dollars and amortize them, it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| nothing over 20 years. To keep this moving. I look back on 2008, where we stopped Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6442)|
| 1:47:30| and we stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| Chaud Road and Parkside just got done a couple of years or two ago, and Chaud Road hadn't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| touched since. So I think we're pretty good at laying things down and never picking them back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| And I don't think this project is worth laying down at this point where we're at now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Anders. Then Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My comments were about use of funds was specifically about the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| motel tax. I just want to be clear about that. If there's a balance in that, that's what we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| use to help support our tourism dollar tourism businesses. As it relates to this, I would, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| echo that, you know, the the we've debated this whole project at nauseam, nauseam for a long, long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| time, and it saves a lot more money in the long run. And I think we ought to continue on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6496)|
| 1:48:22| continue with this project as it is. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, so this money that's being spent and allocated to this, the 6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6509)|
| 1:48:37| will come from the sale of the AJ building. The rest is a bond premium, which can only go towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6517)|
| 1:48:45| a capital project, could not go to any businesses or any other type of general fund projects. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| it's only going to pull 3, 3 or 4 million out of our general fund over probably a couple budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| cycles. And on the downside, on the upside, it will save the school system will have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| to put a million dollars into mental health counselors and helping our children. It will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6543)|
| 1:49:10| also save the county money in the fact that our payments will be less than what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| are giving them in the million dollar savings. And also importantly to economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| whenever they start working on this building over here, they're probably going to spend 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| million dollars on it. That will go a long way towards keeping people working here in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| County on that project. I think we do have several ways to get out of this if we get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6572)|
| 1:49:40| little bit farther down the road and we think that this is going to be a long, long term problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| But I honestly have faith in my God, faith in my country, faith in my state, faith in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6586)|
| 1:49:53| and faith in our faith in our citizens that we're going to get through this. And I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| stop a project that I know is good for Knox County whenever I have faith that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| get through. All right. All right. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Jay and Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| both of y'all's lights are still on. All right. Okay. I see you too. But I'd like to recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6609)|
| 1:50:19| though he doesn't really have a light to turn on, I do want to call on Chris Caldwell to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| weigh in on this one in terms of some of the questions that have been posed so that the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| recognizes Chris Caldwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like I said before, we had set aside this bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6630)|
| 1:50:40| premium for said project. You will see us bring once the AJ building is sold, you'll see us bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6640)|
| 1:50:50| that six million dollars as a as an appropriation to finish this project. And we're just taking a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6650)|
| 1:50:59| small percentage from general fund to complete the project. So we don't really issue any bonds per se| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6659)|
| 1:51:07| for this project. And so we feel it's a good project. I agree with what Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| and a few others said that it does help with local jobs. It's also going to establish a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6673)|
| 1:51:21| rapport with UT. I know just last week, President Boyd toured and he's ready to move in. So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6681)|
| 1:51:31| ready to forge with that partnership. And we will keep a close eye on all projects with the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6691)|
| 1:51:37| economy and go from there. As far as Commissioner Bussler's comments related to COVID-19 testing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6697)|
| 1:51:48| the uninsured and those expenses, we are tracking those separately. This will not impact what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| can spend as it relates to our citizens and COVID-19. And well, we track those separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6714)|
| 1:52:03| because we know that that's going to be a reimbursable expense for us. And we have done so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| by putting those in our in our grants fund. And sooner rather than later, you all will be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6729)|
| 1:52:15| a resolution approving our FEMA grant as it relates to COVID-19. So this project has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6735)|
| 1:52:23| impact on us responding to COVID-19. All right. Thank you, Chris. I don't want to put words in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| your mouth. And Mr. Gill, I recognize your light. I'll get to you in just a second. But one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| questions from a commissioner was kind of like, I can't remember if it was Anders or one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| others, but there are some, I guess, I don't know what the right word is, kind of get out of jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| clauses or things that as we move forward, if it looks like this is not not feasible when we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| down to the brass tacks on the actual contract that could, you know, kind of unwind this. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| clear? I know that that the attorney may not be there, but is that is that kind of true? Or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| if you could kind of put that in layman's English. That is true. We've got clauses like that in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| in this contract. And quite frankly, the contract with BNA as it relates to the AJ bill. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6789)|
| 1:53:19| there's clauses on our side and TVA side on the other project that that ties into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| us and BNA as well have have outs that that can be had if we see the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6805)|
| 1:53:33| We've never thought about pulling out of the deal with TVA because it's such a great deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| It's going to actually reduce school expenditures for FY 21, which they're going to desperately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6818)|
| 1:53:46| need. As you can imagine, and I don't know if you know this or not, but a vast majority of the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| tax that is collected in Knox County goes to schools and that's there. They will be hit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| hardest as a fund as it relates to a slowdown in the economy as it goes to COVID-19. So we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6838)|
| 1:54:08| to help them all that we can. And I think this this takes an expense off of them and puts it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| on to us and it's all set as we get UT moved into the East Tower. Thank you. Mr. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6854)|
| 1:54:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just need to make a comment. So with UT on hiatus, is the time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| still the same? And we have a sunset date in September. Are we still on the same time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6871)|
| 1:54:38| And I think Commissioner Bussler is speaking to public confidence in terms of what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| doing as a commission. And I appreciate that these are local dollars, but I think with this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6884)|
| 1:54:52| it does strike fear into people in terms of if we are prepared as a county to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6892)|
| 1:55:00| a major outbreak. And I know you said one doesn't have anything to do with the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| And I also can appreciate that in the scheme of spending this money long term in our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| that it is a drop in a bucket. But I still am unclear that we can make the September sunset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6910)|
| 1:55:19| and UT is interested in entering this business and entering the East Tower. Are they still on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6919)|
| 1:55:26| target? Are we still on target considering the school itself is closed and where they stand on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6926)|
| 1:55:35| that? Because you indicated that UT was ready to move forward with moving into this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| So I just needed to have a follow up with that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| Sure. Everything is still on target. I will tell you that with people working from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| not only at TVA, but us and Bass Ferry Sims, we do believe that closing the documents with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6951)|
| 1:56:02| and Knox County may be pushed to May. We were hoping for mid-April, but that may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6962)|
| 1:56:09| pushed to May. But that's nowhere near our September drop dead. Furthermore, while UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6969)|
| 1:56:17| as far as the campus is, are not on campus, the system is working. And President Boyd and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6977)|
| 1:56:27| members of his staff took a tour last week, and he's ready to start. And we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| with them on a subcontract, a sub-easement for their six floors. And so everything on that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=6994)|
| 1:56:41| on target as well. So we don't see a major slowdown. Of course, there will be a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| slowdown because of COVID-19, but it won't be anything drastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| Thanks for that clarification. Let me see if there's any additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7016)|
| 1:57:02| lights on here. I'm not seeing any additional lights. Does anybody have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| any additional questions for Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| Okay. All right. Seeing none, we have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7027)|

| 2:02:17| the 2020 Census Joint Complete Account Executive Committee. This is resolution 9-0-5. The chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7337)|
| 2:02:27| recognizes Commissioner Jay with the motion and Commissioner Anders with the second on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| Commissioner Jay, I'm going to open this up to you for some discussion on this one. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| Mr. Chairman. This is a resolution just affirming that we are in the middle of our census and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7357)|
| 2:02:44| encouraging all Knox County citizens to participate in the census. Our annual, sorry, our count that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| happens once every 10 years is very important to how federal dollars are allocated and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7371)|
| 2:02:57| into our state and into our county ultimately. And while everybody in Knox County is staying at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7377)|
| 2:03:06| home or safer at home, there is plenty of time to respond to your census and participate so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| have an accurate count. So I want to thank everybody in advance for hopefully supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| this and encouraging your friends, neighbors, and constituents to participate in the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Biggs. Thank you, Chairman. We've been on several meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| and things of that nature for the census, and I just wanted to echo what Commissioner Jay said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| but also let everyone know that a lot of the UT students hopefully have not gone home yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| They can count right now themselves here and those dollars will count for the Knox County area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| There's a lot of information and you will probably be seeing some of the billboards that says count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| me in Knox. Those are for the census. Also, it's in the city tax bills and the county tax bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| that just came out as your reminder notices in February, at the end of February, beginning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| March. So they're doing a huge push, a huge campaign to try to get our numbers up that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7439)|
| 2:04:05| in the areas where we were kind of lacking a decade ago. So thank you for all your hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7445)|
| 2:04:10| Commissioner Jay. I know he and I have both poured multiple hours into this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| Commissioner Biggs, I've got a question for you. You just mentioned that about the UT students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| Are y'all aware of any kind of outreach that's going out to UT students to get them to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| counted or to help encourage them that the count, you know, is living here while they're here or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| just to participate? Have y'all heard anything on that? And by the way, although she's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| maybe she's watching online, I just want to give a personal shout out to Vivian who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| she's put a lot of her heart into this one. So Vivian, I mean, she's awesome. But anyhow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7479)|
| 2:04:47| any other follow-up on that as it relates to UT students? I met with President Boyd, it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7487)|
| 2:04:53| months ago, and he has a team that he has assigned to the executive leadership team for the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7493)|
| 2:05:00| They're doing a lot of things. They're really social media heavy right now through Twitter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| through Instagram and things like that. But what you can look at is they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| counting themselves in now that, you know, spring break and things like that are coming to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| But yes, Vivian Underwood-Shipes doing an amazing job. Jerry Julian's also on that team. He's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| a really good job. But Randy Boyd is aware of it and he's got a great team in effect over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| on UT campus as well. Right. Thank you. Commissioner Daley. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7526)|
| 2:05:35| Jay and Commissioner Biggs for your hard work and all this support. And ditto to Vivian. Way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7535)|
| 2:05:42| girl. She's been out there working hard. I've seen her at senior centers and other places trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| get recruits. And I'm sure now, since the unemployment's low, that she's still be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| for workers. So check with her. And if you don't mind, Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| would you open this up to a full commission? Yeah, of course. I think anybody would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| sign on to it. Be happy to. And I also just want to add one thing to two things to this. One is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7563)|
| 2:06:10| the census is very easy to fill out online and you should be getting something in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7570)|
| 2:06:15| A census worker will only come to your house if you have not responded. So they're not sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7575)|
| 2:06:21| blanketing everybody. It's most of the people that will respond will get the notice in the mail and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7581)|
| 2:06:27| go online. But one thing to make sure to share with all the constituents you have is to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| watch out for scams and online phishing emails that may pose as census to try to obtain information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7592)|
| 2:06:40| So you really the only way that you will have gotten your census information is in the mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| and then you respond online. It's very easy, but we'd be happy to have anybody sign on to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7604)|
| 2:06:49| Thank you. All right. Thank you. Let's see. Commissioner Jay and Biggs, your lights are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| still on. I think Commissioner Gill was on earlier. Seeing all the lights are off. The original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7614)|
| 2:07:02| makers of the motion, I'd like to, and just through a nod of heads, have that amended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7622)|
| 2:07:08| reflect all the commissioners signing on as sponsors. If every commissioner could just nod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| your head, then we'll move forward with that. Okay, that's good. So to our county clerks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7632)|
| 2:07:20| Angie, if you could please call a roll call vote. You're voting on support of this resolution with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7640)|

| 2:10:59| tonight. Okay. We'll handle that through the commissioner's forum. Okay. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7859)|
| 2:11:09| that gets us through tonight's agenda. First, I want to thank everybody and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7869)|

| 2:11:51| the law director has no problem with the meeting tonight. It is official and as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7911)|

| 2:12:14| this went really smoothly for a first time. I hope it's the only time we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| to do it this way. And secondly, John, I'm dying to know what's in that picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| behind your head. What's that? You'll have to wait and see. All right. Who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7944)|
| 2:12:34| knows? It could be a boat or something or a bowl of fruit. So, you know, what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| might just kind of close with, thank you, everybody, for your patience to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| public. I know at the very beginning of the meeting, it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| like the feed coming in from CTV may not have been quite there. I hope our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7966)|

| 2:12:56| getting that out there. But this, all things considered, I thought this went as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| good as it possibly could be. You know, there's going to be some hiccups through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| it, so thank you to all my fellow commissioners and all the folks who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| who are here tonight. So, you know, I want to thank you. I also want to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200330?start=7987)|
