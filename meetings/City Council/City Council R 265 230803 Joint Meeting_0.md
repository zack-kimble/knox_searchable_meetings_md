| 0:01:00| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=60.92)|

| 0:01:28| I want to turn it first over to Lieutenant Governor McNally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=88.32000000000001)|

| 0:01:35| It's a pleasure for me to be here, and I serve in the Senate as a member of the Senate, also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=95.44000000000001)|
| 0:01:44| Speaker of the Senate, and also by virtue of statute, Lieutenant Governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=104.4)|
| 0:01:52| My duties as Lieutenant Governor are very minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=112.24000000000001)|
| 0:01:57| I like to joke and say all I do is check on Bill Lee's polls, but I'm actually a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=117.83999999999999)|
| 0:02:07| of the legislature, and I actually represent precincts in Knoxville along with Becky and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=127.44)|
| 0:02:15| Dr. Briggs, and one of my duties, first and foremost, is to appoint all the committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=135.84)|
| 0:02:25| of the Senate, and I was very fortunate in being able to choose Dr. Briggs to chair our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=145.20000000000002)|

| 0:02:38| and Safety Committee, and that's probably the only time in history, I think, that Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=158.64000000000001)|
| 0:02:44| has had three chairmen out of the nine chairmen, so you can see it's not only are they on very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=164.8)|
| 0:02:52| important committees, but they also hold a significant portion of power in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=172.72000000000003)|
| 0:03:04| and I certainly want to thank them and enjoy being here with you and enjoy being here with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=184.16000000000003)|

| 0:03:31| delegation members for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=211.68)|
| 0:03:34| This topic is incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=214.4)|
| 0:03:36| I feel that at some point in our lives, each of us will be touched by some sort of mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=216.72)|
| 0:03:43| health issue, whether it's ourselves, a family member, a friend, and so I just want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=223.12)|
| 0:03:50| you and those of you who are in the audience for coming and showing support and showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=230.00000000000003)|
| 0:03:55| that this is such an important issue that we face today, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=235.12)|
| 0:04:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=241.60000000000002)|

| 0:04:04| I want to express my sincere gratitude for all of our local leaders who took time out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=244.56)|
| 0:04:08| of their day today to come and assemble this, both from city county, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=248.8)|
| 0:04:14| as well as our state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=254.48000000000002)|
| 0:04:16| It is unique to have representatives of three different legislative branches together, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=256.8)|
| 0:04:22| only once, but we've done this before, so this is the second time we've gotten together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=262.56)|
| 0:04:26| so I think that's incredible, and we're all trying to work together to make our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=266.56)|
| 0:04:32| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=272.0)|
| 0:04:32| It is certainly not lost on me, or I'm sure any of the other folks that are here, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=272.8)|
| 0:04:37| there are passionate differences of opinions that we all have, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=277.28000000000003)|
| 0:04:41| However, as many times we've done this before, I certainly have faith that we can set those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=281.92)|
| 0:04:46| differences aside and work together towards a common purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=286.64000000000004)|
| 0:04:51| For those joining us here today and for those watching at home, this joint workshop is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=291.76)|
| 0:04:56| people, vulnerable people in our shared community who need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=296.48)|
| 0:05:00| We have all been touched by someone who struggles with mental health, and that common experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=300.88)|
| 0:05:05| is what unites us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=305.36)|
| 0:05:07| While we continue this conversation around mental health and services in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=307.52)|
| 0:05:12| if you know someone or you yourself are suffering from a mental health crisis, please remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=312.64)|
| 0:05:18| you can call 988 to be connected with CARE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=318.23999999999995)|
| 0:05:22| And I had noticed in the audience we have a lot of our professional providers, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=322.24)|
| 0:05:27| just wanted to take a minute before we get started and say thank you, so can we all just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=327.59999999999997)|
| 0:05:33| say a quick thank you to our professional providers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=333.35999999999996)|
| 0:05:36| Okay, well let's get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=336.08)|
| 0:05:44| So first up we have Leanne Heumann-Hillyard and Candice Allen with the McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=344.15999999999997)|
| 0:05:50| and they're going to review with us the Knoxville-Knox County Sequential Intercept Map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=350.56)|
| 0:05:57| So I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=357.2)|
| 0:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=359.35999999999996)|
| 0:06:00| I'll introduce myself again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=360.32)|
| 0:06:01| I'm Leanne Heumann-Hillyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=361.68)|
| 0:06:02| I'm the Executive Vice President for the McNabb Center, and I'm a licensed clinical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=362.88)|
| 0:06:07| social worker, and with me is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=367.68)|
| 0:06:10| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=370.08)|
| 0:06:11| My name is Candice Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=371.12)|
| 0:06:12| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=372.8)|
| 0:06:14| I'm one of the Senior Directors at the McNabb Center, and under my division falls the Criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=374.8)|
| 0:06:20| Justice Continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=380.71999999999997)|
| 0:06:23| So we want to start by reviewing the Knoxville-Knox County Sequential Intercept Mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=383.68)|
| 0:06:32| We...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=392.24)|
| 0:06:32| To back up a little bit, I want to explain a little bit about what we call a SIEM, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=392.88000000000005)|
| 0:06:36| it is, and what the goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=396.40000000000003)|
| 0:06:38| So a SIEM is really a community's process to create a picture of what, at any given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=398.56)|
| 0:06:46| time, the services and providers that make up all of the behavioral health services and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=406.64000000000004)|
| 0:06:54| substance abuse services for an individual who is struggling with a mental illness or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=414.40000000000003)|
| 0:06:58| substance use disorder, who is going through the juvenile...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=418.88)|
| 0:07:03| I'm sorry, the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=423.28000000000003)|
| 0:07:05| So at the end of the SIEM, what we should receive is a map and a picture, and it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=425.52000000000004)|
| 0:07:13| guide us to what we believe in our community, specifically for us, would be gaps and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=433.44)|
| 0:07:20| priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=440.40000000000003)|
| 0:07:22| So one of the reasons we did this is, of course, you all know Knox County...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=442.40000000000003)|
| 0:07:26| Excuse me, the city of Knoxville had asked us to do that, and the last SIEM that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=446.8)|
| 0:07:32| done in our community was back in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=452.40000000000003)|
| 0:07:35| So you can imagine there's a lot of services that have changed since that time into 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=455.84000000000003)|
| 0:07:42| So that's what we wanted to capture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=462.72)|
| 0:07:45| We thought it was important that we get a third-party entity to actually facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=465.6)|
| 0:07:51| that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=471.76)|
| 0:07:53| So we worked with Policy Research Associates, who was nationally recognized as an entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=473.12)|
| 0:08:00| that could come in and really facilitate that process for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=480.56)|
| 0:08:05| What was great about that is that they had facilitated our SIEM back in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=485.44)|
| 0:08:12| So a lot of the things that they were collecting from our community, they already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=492.0)|
| 0:08:17| So we felt like it was a good use and get us off to a really efficient start for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=497.6)|
| 0:08:22| process, because they already had a lot of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=502.88)|
| 0:08:26| The first thing they wanted us to do is create a leadership committee that would guide the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=506.16)|
| 0:08:32| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=512.0)|
| 0:08:33| So that leadership committee was comprised of representatives from the Knox County Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=513.52)|
| 0:08:38| Office, Knox County Police Department, and Advocacy Association, the District Attorney's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=518.72)|
| 0:08:44| Office, the City of Knoxville, the Public Defender's Office, and, of course, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=524.0)|
| 0:08:48| representative from the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=528.88)|
| 0:08:51| Their first task was to identify the key stakeholders that we wanted to make sure were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=531.84)|
| 0:08:57| invited to the SIEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=537.92)|
| 0:09:00| So what they did is identify all of the different social services agencies in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=540.24)|
| 0:09:04| community, all of providers, faith-based organization, consumer advocates group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=544.56)|
| 0:09:10| individuals we know that with learned and lived experiences who can participate in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=550.88)|
| 0:09:16| process, and we sent out invitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=556.0)|
| 0:09:18| And I will tell you, we had a lot of respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=558.48)|
| 0:09:22| If you'll go to the next slide, this is a list of everybody that participated in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=562.08)|
| 0:09:27| April SIEM in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=567.92)|
| 0:09:30| That is not all of the individuals who were invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=570.4)|
| 0:09:33| Those are ones who actually showed up and participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=573.2)|
| 0:09:36| I will say that a few of those had more than one representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=576.64)|
| 0:09:40| So it was one of the largest SIEMs I think there has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=580.16)|
| 0:09:44| It was much larger than the one in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=584.3199999999999)|
| 0:09:46| So I'm really proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=586.88)|
| 0:09:48| It was also during a time, if you will remember, that we weren't sure a lot of people would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=588.0799999999999)|
| 0:09:52| come out and participate in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=592.3199999999999)|
| 0:09:55| So I was very proud of the interest and the investment that everybody had in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=595.36)|
| 0:10:00| to really have a good SIEM completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=600.9599999999999)|
| 0:10:05| It was a two-day workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=605.28)|
| 0:10:06| It was April 6th through the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=606.64)|
| 0:10:09| I'm going to turn it over to Candice to talk a little bit more in detail about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=609.28)|
| 0:10:14| that SIEM actually produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=614.16)|
| 0:10:16| Thank you, Leanne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=616.16)|
| 0:10:17| So I'm going to just do a quick overview of the process of the SIEM and really explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=617.44)|
| 0:10:25| how the top priorities of change were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=625.36)|
| 0:10:30| So if you look at this slide, you will see several components, and we're going to refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=630.5600000000001)|
| 0:10:38| to those as intercepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=638.08)|
| 0:10:40| So at each of these intercepts, an individual who has a behavioral health diagnosis could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=640.32)|
| 0:10:47| become involved in the criminal justice at any point at these intercepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=647.92)|
| 0:10:53| So what the facilitators did is that we addressed each of them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=653.04)|
| 0:10:59| So we would, so start out like with community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=659.4399999999999)|
| 0:11:04| We would develop, we would state, everybody in the room would talk about what do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=664.4)|
| 0:11:10| under community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=670.32)|
| 0:11:12| And that's called intercept zeros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=672.72)|
| 0:11:14| Everybody would list what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=674.88)|
| 0:11:17| And so they would go through that whole continuum and do this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=677.76)|
| 0:11:21| At the end of that, what you have is a map of existing services that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=681.76)|
| 0:11:27| And I'm just going to give brief examples maybe of some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=687.2)|
| 0:11:31| We parked a long time on intercept zero, which is community services, because that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=691.5200000000001)|
| 0:11:36| you're going to find your crisis services, your crisis lines, mobile crisis, co-response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=696.8000000000001)|
| 0:11:44| those kind of responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=704.5600000000001)|
| 0:11:48| Number two in the law enforcement, of course, that's where you're going to have your 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=708.1600000000001)|
| 0:11:52| your patrol responses, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=712.48)|
| 0:11:55| Number three, initial detention, initial court hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=715.8399999999999)|
| 0:12:00| And then in the next one, in jails and courts, you're talking about specialized courts there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=720.56)|
| 0:12:06| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=726.9599999999999)|
| 0:12:07| You know, we have our recovery court, veterans court, and soon to be mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=727.76)|
| 0:12:12| We're very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=732.56)|
| 0:12:14| That was discussed at the SEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=734.0)|
| 0:12:16| Reentry would include both jail and prison reentry programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=736.72)|
| 0:12:21| And then, of course, community corrections that involves probation and parole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=741.28)|
| 0:12:26| So everybody had input into what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=746.0799999999999)|
| 0:12:29| And the next step was that we also identified what we thought we should have that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=749.8399999999999)|
| 0:12:35| have under each of those intercepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=755.8399999999999)|
| 0:12:38| And that is when that list, that complete list of what everybody in the room was able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=758.3199999999999)|
| 0:12:44| to participate in and contribute to, they were all listed on what everybody thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=764.56)|
| 0:12:50| the gaps were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=770.0)|
| 0:12:51| The next step was to vote on these gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=771.04)|
| 0:12:53| So you had 60 plus individuals voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=773.52)|
| 0:12:56| You could vote for your top priorities, and you could have three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=776.8)|
| 0:13:01| And you only could put one by, I mean, you couldn't like vote for one priority three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=781.76)|
| 0:13:06| times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=786.64)|
| 0:13:07| And so what developed and came out of that was what you see as the top five priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=787.52)|
| 0:13:13| for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=793.1999999999999)|
| 0:13:14| And so what they were, number one, this is the most votes, expand case management resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=794.4000000000001)|
| 0:13:23| intensive communities-based, and improve community standards for case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=803.3600000000001)|
| 0:13:29| Number two, uninsured services expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=809.6)|
| 0:13:33| Number three, affordable permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=813.84)|
| 0:13:38| Number four, expand city co-response, development of county co-response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=818.6400000000001)|
| 0:13:46| Also add Tennessee State Police to the crisis intervention team training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=826.6400000000001)|
| 0:13:54| And I will just add that that was already taken care of because we invited them to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=834.8800000000001)|
| 0:13:58| next one that we had, and they participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=838.5600000000001)|
| 0:14:01| And number five, transitional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=841.0400000000001)|
| 0:14:03| So what we received at the end of that process was this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=843.92)|
| 0:14:09| And so it is the Knoxville-Knox County SIM report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=849.92)|
| 0:14:14| What you will find in it is the actual map itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=854.48)|
| 0:14:18| So it's going to outline all of the services at that point in time in each of those intercept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=858.8000000000001)|
| 0:14:25| points, and you can review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=865.76)|
| 0:14:27| It also talked about opportunities and gaps among each of those sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=867.84)|
| 0:14:33| You'll see, of course, what Candice mentioned, the priorities for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=873.6800000000001)|
| 0:14:37| There were more than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=877.9200000000001)|
| 0:14:39| There were, I think, 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=879.44)|
| 0:14:41| They focus on the top five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=881.5200000000001)|
| 0:14:44| But you will see all of those, and you will see the number of votes that each one received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=884.5600000000001)|
| 0:14:50| Well, it'll also break down in some recommended action steps that the groups were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=890.8000000000001)|
| 0:14:55| problem-solving about how to reach those priorities, as well as the Policy Research Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=895.7600000000001)|
| 0:15:03| recommendations, much more on a larger scale of, you know, input they would want us to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=903.7600000000001)|
| 0:15:12| What I would say, like I said already, this map's already probably out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=912.32)|
| 0:15:17| It's been since April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=917.6800000000001)|
| 0:15:19| So we have already expanded to those services that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=919.9200000000001)|
| 0:15:24| Just as a few off the top of my head that I was thinking about, we have increased and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=924.64)|
| 0:15:29| expanded medication-assisted treatment in our community since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=929.36)|
| 0:15:34| We have increased the mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=934.1600000000001)|
| 0:15:38| Candice mentioned that we'll get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=938.48)|
| 0:15:40| That's very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=940.32)|
| 0:15:41| We have already talked and funded an empath unit, which I'll talk about later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=941.76)|
| 0:15:46| And then we are expanding residential substance use disorder treatment bed space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=946.96)|
| 0:15:52| So those are just a few things that are on the horizon that are already additions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=952.24)|
| 0:15:57| intercepts that are not in the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=957.76)|
| 0:16:00| And with that, I'll end our SIEM report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=960.88)|
| 0:16:03| DR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=963.84)|
| 0:16:04| WARREN BUFFETT Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=964.24)|
| 0:16:05| And just so everybody knows, we're going to go through the presentations, and there'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=965.44)|
| 0:16:08| be questions and discussion afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=968.88)|
| 0:16:11| So Leigh Ann, I think you're up next as well talking to us about the crisis response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=971.9200000000001)|

| 0:16:18| So I'll turn it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=978.5600000000001)|

| 0:16:26| DR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=986.0)|
| 0:16:27| WARREN BUFFETT And while you're waiting for that to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=987.52)|
| 0:16:36| up, the senator was just reminding me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=996.48)|
| 0:16:38| Everyone will get copies of these afterwards, so you'll have them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=998.72)|
| 0:16:43| DR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1003.44)|
| 0:16:43| LEIGH ANN BRYAN Now that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1003.52)|

| 0:16:54| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1014.64)|
| 0:16:55| Candace and I are also going to talk to you a little about McNabb Center's Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1015.2)|
| 0:17:00| and Knox County Crisis and Response Continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1020.32)|
| 0:17:03| Before we get started, I want to say there are nine different programs that we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1023.76)|
| 0:17:07| to talk about, and each of those nine programs, if we did them justice, would take 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1027.76)|
| 0:17:14| probably, at the very least, to explain and talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1034.24)|
| 0:17:18| So I would ask that you kind of sit back and look at it as a large overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1038.32)|
| 0:17:24| What I hoped to be able to convey is that we have a large continuum that meets gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1044.56)|
| 0:17:32| in our service delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1052.72)|
| 0:17:34| I'd also say these programs, even though they look very independent, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1054.32)|
| 0:17:39| They are not sequential in their service delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1059.76)|
| 0:17:44| They're also not necessarily parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1064.6399999999999)|
| 0:17:46| What I would say is that an individual can be involved in a few of those programs at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1066.8799999999999)|
| 0:17:52| the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1072.8)|
| 0:17:54| So it's a complex system, purposefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1074.3999999999999)|
| 0:17:57| It is highly medical on one end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1077.3600000000001)|
| 0:17:59| When you get into more of the extended stay programs, the overnight programs, those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1079.92)|
| 0:18:06| going to be heavily medically based, strongly clinically based on the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1086.5600000000002)|
| 0:18:11| So we'll kind of walk through that, but I would kind of give you that as a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1091.5200000000002)|

| 0:18:18| Before I move further, I want to just take a minute to just remind all of us that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1098.16)|
| 0:18:25| community has come together on numerous projects that I'm very, very proud of us on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1105.3600000000001)|

| 0:19:02| And we created a true jail diversion program for people who are on arrest and are in need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1142.64)|
| 0:19:10| of behavioral health or mental health or substance abuse treatment services and needed a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1150.4)|

| 0:19:15| So I applaud all of us for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1155.2)|
| 0:19:17| And if you look below, you will see our friend Candace Allen and Chief Noel congratulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1157.6000000000001)|

| 0:19:29| This is the 11th year we have been providing crisis intervention team training with thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1169.44)|
| 0:19:34| of law enforcement officers trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1174.88)|
| 0:19:37| It gives them additional tools and skills when working with individuals experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1177.68)|
| 0:19:43| a mental health crisis that they can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1183.28)|
| 0:19:47| We're also very proud of that and the partnerships that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1187.28)|

| 0:19:57| We are very proud of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1197.28)|
| 0:20:00| It is embedded in East Tennessee Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1200.16)|
| 0:20:03| And we're serving individuals, children right now, who in the past may needed to have gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1203.3600000000001)|
| 0:20:08| to a residential or an inpatient psychiatric facility and there was a gap in care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1208.4)|
| 0:20:13| And this absolutely is filling that need for children and families in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1213.04)|
| 0:20:18| So if you go to the next slide, we start some of the nine programs that we want to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1218.24)|
| 0:20:22| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1222.56)|
| 0:20:23| I'll first start with the Mobile Crisis Walk-In Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1223.12)|
| 0:20:26| I think it's important for you all to know that that is a statewide system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1226.8799999999999)|
| 0:20:31| So anybody in the state of Tennessee experiencing a behavioral health emergency can call a mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1231.6)|
| 0:20:38| crisis unit in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1238.0)|
| 0:20:40| And McNabb Center oversees 11 of those counties in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1240.64)|
| 0:20:47| So what I think is very important also to understand is it is a call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1247.44)|
| 0:20:53| And it is a call center that is staffed to triage crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1253.8400000000001)|
| 0:20:58| So when a call comes in, and those calls can come from a variety of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1258.96)|
| 0:21:02| It can be from an individual experiencing an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1262.96)|
| 0:21:05| It can be from a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1265.1200000000001)|
| 0:21:06| It could be from jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1266.8000000000002)|
| 0:21:08| It could be from the children's detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1268.96)|
| 0:21:12| It could be from a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1272.48)|
| 0:21:13| It could be from another provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1273.76)|
| 0:21:15| They're reaching out to us for crisis intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1275.68)|
| 0:21:19| The goal of that unit is to triage that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1279.44)|
| 0:21:23| Some of those calls will go to providing information, resources, and that's all that will be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1283.68)|
| 0:21:32| But a large number of those calls are coming in when individuals need to have a face-to-face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1292.96)|
| 0:21:38| assessment to see if they need to go to an inpatient psychiatric hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1298.72)|
| 0:21:45| We respond in person to jails, to the juvenile detention facility, and to schools unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1305.6000000000001)|
| 0:21:55| they request a telehealth appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1315.44)|
| 0:21:59| A large, large majority of these calls are coming from the hospital settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1319.2800000000002)|
| 0:22:04| So it is a face-to-face done telehealth with emergency departments all around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1324.24)|
| 0:22:10| That is the vast majority of those calls that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1330.88)|
| 0:22:14| We will respond to private residences and public settings like streets and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1334.64)|
| 0:22:21| When those calls come in, we do ask for law enforcement assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1341.6)|
| 0:22:26| We always prioritize community-based calls first as those are individuals who are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1346.56)|
| 0:22:31| the need of the most safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1351.68)|
| 0:22:33| Those are the most safety risk as far as we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1353.68)|
| 0:22:37| I think it's almost easier to say what we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1357.52)|
| 0:22:41| This service is not a first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1361.3600000000001)|
| 0:22:43| So we're contracted by the Department of Mental Health to be able to provide assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1363.6000000000001)|
| 0:22:48| to adults within two hours and assessments for children within one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1368.4)|
| 0:22:55| And to give you a little bit of a sense of the volume, we showed the Knox County number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1375.28)|
| 0:23:01| up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1381.28)|
| 0:23:02| So we're providing face-to-face, no, that includes telehealth assessments to about 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1382.16)|
| 0:23:08| individuals each day in need of evaluation for inpatient psychiatric hospitalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1388.96)|
| 0:23:14| from that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1394.8000000000002)|
| 0:23:17| And with that, Candace, do you want to talk about co-response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1397.1200000000001)|
| 0:23:19| Yes, I'll be glad to talk about the Knoxville co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1399.92)|
| 0:23:23| And I know that KPD is here and we'll also be talking about it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1403.1200000000001)|
| 0:23:27| And so when we started looking at co-response, there are a lot of different models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1407.68)|
| 0:23:34| What we chose to provide was an actual team that is together partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1414.08)|
| 0:23:42| So you have a master's level behavioral health specialist partnered with a crisis intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1422.24)|
| 0:23:50| team trained officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1430.6399999999999)|
| 0:23:53| And they respond in tandem to calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1433.04)|
| 0:23:55| They are partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1435.36)|
| 0:23:57| They're responding to calls from the community, crisis calls for people that are in psychiatric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1437.28)|
| 0:24:01| crisis and other issues with maybe co-occurring issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1441.76)|
| 0:24:08| And what I want everyone to hear is that when they respond, they are responding with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1448.0)|
| 0:24:17| goals to help someone compassionately and kindly through this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1457.2)|
| 0:24:23| And they have the skills and they're trained to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1463.9199999999998)|
| 0:24:26| That is the goal to help that individual that is in need at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1466.4)|
| 0:24:31| We currently have four teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1471.68)|
| 0:24:35| We started out in 2020 with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1475.2800000000002)|

| 0:24:39| And then three additional were added the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1479.2800000000002)|
| 0:24:42| We operate from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. weekly throughout the week and the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1482.5600000000002)|
| 0:24:52| What we don't have is 24-hour coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1492.0800000000002)|
| 0:24:55| And we also need additional teams to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1495.2800000000002)|
| 0:24:59| Because, you know, you might be on one call and then several other calls will come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1499.2800000000002)|
| 0:25:03| So we need to expand that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1503.8400000000001)|

| 0:25:24| going to need inpatient care, so we're going to send them to the EDs because we know they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1524.96)|
| 0:25:29| have to have medical clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1529.5200000000002)|
| 0:25:31| And then also included in that 50 percent are lower level crisis programs that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1531.3600000000001)|

| 0:25:42| So we have other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1542.72)|
| 0:25:44| The other 48 percent that we would talk about are actually able to be stabilized and left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1544.32)|

| 0:26:28| We do several follow-ups with our individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1588.08)|

| 0:26:41| And while those two programs serve adults and children, we believe that we want to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1601.28)|
| 0:26:47| programs that are unique just for families and children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1607.76)|

| 0:28:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1712.8)|

| 0:28:41| So Leanne had referenced that before because what I always say about it, it really is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1721.68)|
| 0:28:47| true jail diversion program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1727.92)|
| 0:28:49| This is not just law enforcement dropping off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1729.68)|
| 0:28:53| These are individuals that were on their way to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1733.2)|

| 0:29:11| treatment as opposed to going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1751.3600000000001)|
| 0:29:14| So we're very proud of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1754.88)|
| 0:29:18| So when they arrive at the facility, they are seen by a master's level clinician, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1758.72)|

| 0:29:40| So we're talking to them, we're engaging, we're trying to understand what the barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1780.64)|

| 0:29:52| And I think one of the most important things that's attached to the Behavioral Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1792.72)|
| 0:29:58| Urgent Care Center is our ability to provide intensive case management when they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1798.0)|

| 0:30:06| It's voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1806.48)|

| 0:30:13| And these are case managers that are intensive, that work with these individuals in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1813.84)|
| 0:30:18| streets, their boots on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1818.4)|
| 0:30:20| The outcomes are wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1820.48)|
| 0:30:22| They help them get into treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1822.0)|
| 0:30:24| They transport them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1824.56)|
| 0:30:27| They do a wide variety of things to help them be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1827.68)|
| 0:30:33| So next is EMPath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1833.04)|
| 0:30:34| And if you haven't heard of EMPath, I hope you leave today knowing a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1834.24)|
| 0:30:39| about what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1839.12)|

| 0:30:54| So this is another initiative that our community has been trying to address for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1854.16)|
| 0:31:02| and working with the area hospital systems to say individuals are entering emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1862.96)|
| 0:31:11| departments all across our county in need of psychiatric help and they're being boarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1871.04)|
| 0:31:18| often in those EDs before they can get to help where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1878.56)|
| 0:31:22| So our goal is to divert individuals from the ED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1882.72)|
| 0:31:26| So in order to do that, we are building a true walk-in center that individuals can walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1886.56)|
| 0:31:33| in, family members can bring them, loved ones can bring them, and get immediate access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1893.2)|

| 0:31:55| so that individuals are not agitated or having to experience any more barriers than they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1915.2)|
| 0:32:02| already had to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1922.64)|
| 0:32:04| So we want to get them in, treat them compassionately and quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1924.24)|
| 0:32:08| And then of course the most important thing as with any service that we do is establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1928.96)|
| 0:32:14| those wraparound services so that when the individual leaves they are connected and engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1934.56)|
| 0:32:19| with other services that already exist in our community and that we follow up and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1939.8400000000001)|
| 0:32:23| sure those connections actually happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1943.76)|
| 0:32:27| Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit about crisis stabilization units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1947.76)|
| 0:32:31| You know, as Leanne referenced before as well, we are very happy to have our children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1951.76)|

| 0:32:40| But let's talk about why they are so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1960.64)|
| 0:32:44| You know, previous to having our CSUs, if an individual was experiencing, a child, an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1964.56)|

| 0:32:57| to go inpatient, maybe they didn't need to go to a state hospital, a locked unit, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1977.8400000000001)|
| 0:33:03| they had no other option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1983.92)|
| 0:33:05| You know, so lots of times people had to go to a higher level, more intensive level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1985.6000000000001)|

| 0:33:12| And sometimes that's not the best thing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1992.8)|
| 0:33:15| But you couldn't leave them at home either, so lots of times that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1995.76)|
| 0:33:19| So we are very thankful to have our crisis stabilization units because it provides that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1999.28)|
| 0:33:24| support that meets their needs and the services that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2004.64)|
| 0:33:29| So when we look at this, someone can come in, it's voluntary, and they are met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2009.44)|

| 0:33:54| there's groups that specifically are designed for the MLEU and what's going on with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2034.8)|
| 0:34:00| individual and that group at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2040.48)|
| 0:34:02| And I think when I look at, and also prescriber, we're stabilizing people, so we also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2042.8799999999999)|
| 0:34:08| a prescriber that can start people on medication right away and continue that when they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2048.8)|
| 0:34:14| One of the most important parts, I think, about our crisis stabilization units is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2054.8)|
| 0:34:20| discharge plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2060.2400000000002)|
| 0:34:22| We take every bit of information that we can and we wrap services around that person and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2062.0000000000005)|
| 0:34:28| what we are trying to do is provide a treatment pathway for that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2068.32)|
| 0:34:33| They walk in in crisis and they leave with hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2073.44)|
| 0:34:36| And our crisis stabilization units do that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2076.7200000000003)|
| 0:34:40| The only thing I'd add to that is our adult crisis stabilization is up to five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2080.08)|
| 0:34:44| Our children is up to 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2084.48)|
| 0:34:48| And we're not seeing that we need, oftentimes, that length of stay, but we're able to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2088.64)|
| 0:34:54| it if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2094.0)|
| 0:34:55| What you'll also see up there is crisis respite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2095.12)|
| 0:34:57| And that is a fairly, fairly new addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2097.84)|
| 0:35:02| It is a little, actually, the best way for me to describe it is on either end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2102.08)|

| 0:35:15| a crisis stabilization unit, but they need to stay just a little bit longer because maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2115.2)|
| 0:35:20| they need shoring up housing or their discharge plan needs to be secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2120.4)|
| 0:35:25| Or maybe the plan for discharge isn't tight enough at discharge and we want to keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2125.44)|
| 0:35:31| one more day to make that secure and happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2131.2000000000003)|
| 0:35:33| So that's a new service we've been able to add to the Department of Mental Health to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2133.6)|
| 0:35:37| this continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2137.84)|
| 0:35:40| If you'll go to the next slide, I will leave you with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2140.2400000000002)|
| 0:35:44| These are a few of our outcomes for those levels of care and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2144.96)|
| 0:35:50| What you will see is consistently the goal in these services is to provide the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2150.88)|
| 0:35:58| level of care in the least restrictive setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2158.48)|
| 0:36:01| So you're going to see outcomes that are looking at divert from psychiatric hospitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2161.6800000000003)|
| 0:36:07| divert from jail or incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2167.6)|
| 0:36:10| We want to make sure people are engaged in treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2170.8)|
| 0:36:14| So that is some of our outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2174.32)|
| 0:36:17| We're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2177.6800000000003)|
| 0:36:18| And with that, that ends our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2178.88)|
| 0:36:22| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2182.0)|
| 0:36:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2184.0)|
| 0:36:24| Now we're going to start looking at the current responses that we have as well as additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2184.32)|
| 0:36:29| response options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2189.36)|

| 0:37:01| And I have been working as a therapist for the past seven years, primarily with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2221.92)|
| 0:37:06| experiencing significant mental health issues and substance use issues too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2226.7200000000003)|
| 0:37:11| I am a member of Knoxville Heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2231.68)|
| 0:37:14| So if you want to go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2234.88)|
| 0:37:20| Excuse me one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2240.96)|
| 0:37:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2243.52)|
| 0:37:24| So who is Knoxville Heart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2244.0)|
| 0:37:25| Some of you are very familiar with us and some of you probably have never heard of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2245.92)|
| 0:37:29| before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2249.6)|
| 0:37:30| So our mission is to advocate for an alternative first response team in Knoxville to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2250.96)|
| 0:37:36| outcomes for people in crisis and reduce demand for police involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2256.56)|
| 0:37:41| So what I'm going to be talking about today is alternative response teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2261.2)|
| 0:37:44| And again, some of you all might know what that is and some of you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2264.64)|
| 0:37:48| So this will just be a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2268.24)|
| 0:37:50| And we also have packets of handouts for you all after this so you can take home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2270.4)|
| 0:37:55| And we're always happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2275.12)|
| 0:37:58| But basically, Knoxville Heart is a group of volunteer community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2278.64)|
| 0:38:03| And we've been working together since summer of 2020 to advocate for alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2283.84)|
| 0:38:09| in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2289.2799999999997)|
| 0:38:10| Our group is composed of people with lived experience, those who have been affected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2290.64)|
| 0:38:14| policing and have had contact with the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2294.96)|
| 0:38:18| We also have behavioral health clinicians and other dedicated community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2298.48)|
| 0:38:23| Throughout the year, some of the things that we've been doing is we've conducted focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2303.36)|
| 0:38:27| groups with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2307.92)|
| 0:38:29| We've talked to people with lived experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2309.52)|
| 0:38:31| We facilitated a community de-escalation training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2311.84)|
| 0:38:35| We've met with various business owners, various key government officials, the chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2315.28)|
| 0:38:42| And we've consulted with two alternative response teams across the country, Kahootz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2322.7200000000003)|
| 0:38:47| in Eugene, Oregon, which I'll mention several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2327.28)|
| 0:38:50| They have been running an alternative response team for the past 30 years or over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2330.48)|
| 0:38:57| And Denver Star, which has a newer alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2337.0400000000004)|
| 0:39:02| And recently, we contributed to the successful passage of two city council resolutions affirming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2342.32)|
| 0:39:07| alternative response, which is one of the reasons we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2347.28)|
| 0:39:10| So we're so excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2350.56)|
| 0:39:12| So if you want to go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2352.7200000000003)|
| 0:39:14| So what is alternative response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2354.56)|
| 0:39:17| At its core, it is pairing a medic or an EMT with a behavioral health professional who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2357.2000000000003)|
| 0:39:23| are dispatched by 911 as emergency responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2363.1200000000003)|
| 0:39:28| And they have a van that indicates what they are and a van that's outfitted to meet their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2368.4)|
| 0:39:33| needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2373.84)|
| 0:39:34| So if you want to go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2374.32)|
| 0:39:36| So how does this all work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2376.4)|
| 0:39:37| Okay, how does alternative response work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2377.68)|
| 0:39:39| First step is someone calls 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2379.84)|
| 0:39:42| And the 911 dispatcher has training to triage that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2382.4)|
| 0:39:48| And if they identify that this call would be appropriate for the alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2388.08)|
| 0:39:53| team, they dispatch that alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2393.12)|
| 0:39:56| And the key thing is that team is dispatched without police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2396.16)|
| 0:39:59| So that is one of the main differences from all the other services, you know, we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2399.7599999999998)|
| 0:40:04| about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2404.08)|
| 0:40:05| Now, you do see the police car up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2405.44)|
| 0:40:07| What is that about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2407.2799999999997)|
| 0:40:08| Just because they're dispatched without police doesn't mean there's not collaboration when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2408.48)|
| 0:40:12| needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2412.72)|
| 0:40:13| And so the alternative response team can call for backup if they get into a situation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2413.3599999999997)|
| 0:40:18| realize we do need police here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2418.72)|
| 0:40:20| And what we know from other alternative response teams around the country is that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2420.7999999999997)|
| 0:40:24| police backup less than 1% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2424.8)|
| 0:40:28| So hardly ever, but it is there as an option, which is why this is, you know, in some ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2428.32)|
| 0:40:33| it's collaborative, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2433.52)|
| 0:40:35| But 99% of the time, they're responding without police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2435.04)|
| 0:40:38| So what is it that that team is doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2438.32)|
| 0:40:40| First, they can provide things like basic first aid and meet basic needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2440.96)|
| 0:40:45| They can also do things like provide psychological first aid, crisis intervention, de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2445.6800000000003)|
| 0:40:51| And what we know from some other teams is that about 74% of the calls, the people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2451.92)|
| 0:40:58| able to stay safely in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2458.4)|
| 0:41:00| But sometimes, you know, people need higher levels of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2460.96)|
| 0:41:03| So they might be transported to the hospital, to the CSU, to some of the other incredible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2463.76)|
| 0:41:08| services we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2468.56)|
| 0:41:11| So that is kind of the flow of an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2471.04)|
| 0:41:15| Do you want to go to the next slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2475.6)|
| 0:41:17| So why are we so passionate about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2477.68)|
| 0:41:20| Why have we, as a group, spent three years of our lives trying to make this happen in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2480.4)|
| 0:41:25| our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2485.28)|
| 0:41:26| So we have four main points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2486.08)|
| 0:41:27| The first is alternative response improves outcomes for those in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2487.6)|
| 0:41:32| So police presence can escalate those in crisis, no matter how well-trained that officer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2492.72)|
| 0:41:41| And we also know that people with serious mental health issues are 16 times more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2501.6)|
| 0:41:46| to be killed in a police encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2506.2400000000002)|
| 0:41:50| Research also shows that CIT training, while super valuable, and we're so glad we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2510.7200000000003)|
| 0:41:55| it in our community, research shows that it doesn't have significant effect when we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2515.6800000000003)|
| 0:42:00| at outcomes like arrest, use of force, or injury rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2520.1600000000003)|
| 0:42:04| So when we're able to meet people's needs with a specialized team, like an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2524.0000000000005)|
| 0:42:09| response team, we can improve those outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2529.28)|
| 0:42:13| The second point is it saves the city or the county, if they are involved, money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2533.36)|
| 0:42:17| So CAHOOTS in Eugene, Oregon, saves the city approximately $8.5 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2537.68)|
| 0:42:24| And I think it's important to note that Eugene is similar in budget and population as Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2544.48)|
| 0:42:31| So while programs like alternative response do require an initial financial investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2551.68)|
| 0:42:37| they ultimately save millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2557.44)|
| 0:42:40| And so, like, just think about what Knoxville could do if we had an additional $8.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2560.2400000000002)|
| 0:42:45| a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2565.76)|
| 0:42:46| That's pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2566.6400000000003)|
| 0:42:49| The next point is that it reduces burden on police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2569.2000000000003)|
| 0:42:53| So we had a lovely meeting with Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2573.2000000000003)|
| 0:42:55| Chief Noel is absolutely in support of alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2575.6800000000003)|
| 0:43:00| And he told us that there are so many calls that his officers go out to that do not require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2580.0800000000004)|
| 0:43:05| them to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2585.92)|
| 0:43:07| And so they're having to respond constantly to these calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2587.6800000000003)|
| 0:43:11| We know that police response is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2591.28)|
| 0:43:13| And they're showing up and going, we're not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2593.6)|
| 0:43:16| We don't need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2596.8)|
| 0:43:18| Or this person has mental health needs that are so significant that now we don't, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2598.08)|
| 0:43:23| our capacity is outmatched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2603.2000000000003)|
| 0:43:24| This doesn't meet our skill level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2604.48)|
| 0:43:27| And the department ultimately is really stretched thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2607.2000000000003)|
| 0:43:29| They're having to constantly use overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2609.84)|
| 0:43:32| Kahoots in Eugene responds to 17% of all the calls that the Eugene Police Department gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2612.88)|
| 0:43:39| So imagine how things would change for KPD if they had to respond to 17% fewer calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2619.36)|
| 0:43:44| like, what that would do for the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2624.88)|
| 0:43:48| And then the last point is that alternative response repairs trust with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2628.08)|
| 0:43:53| So many people here might have had really wonderful experiences with police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2633.44)|
| 0:43:59| But I do think we need to be cognizant of the fact that that is not the experience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2639.6)|
| 0:44:04| many people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2644.96)|
| 0:44:06| OK, so people with severe mental health issues, people who use drugs, black and brown people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2646.48)|
| 0:44:12| trans people, and others have really long histories of negative experiences with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2652.4)|
| 0:44:17| police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2657.2)|
| 0:44:18| And so for individuals like that, when an officer shows up alongside a behavioral health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2658.08)|
| 0:44:23| professional, like in co-response, sometimes what that can do is make that individual not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2663.2)|
| 0:44:28| want to seek care anymore and not want to seek mental health care, period, because now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2668.32)|
| 0:44:32| they see that mental health professional coming with police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2672.6400000000003)|
| 0:44:35| And that is something that is very scary and threatening for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2675.76)|
| 0:44:40| Something that Hart learned in our meeting with McNabb is that, you know, one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2680.56)|
| 0:44:44| main gaps of service is looking at how many people aren't even calling 911, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2684.96)|
| 0:44:49| How many people in our community desperately need crisis care and support but will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2689.76)|
| 0:44:56| call 911 because they're very scared and often for good reason, unfortunately, of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2696.0)|
| 0:45:01| will happen if an officer shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2701.04)|
| 0:45:03| So this is the main gap in service, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2703.2)|
| 0:45:06| We do not have a first responder system that responds without police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2706.0)|
| 0:45:12| And that is a huge gap when we're thinking about our folks in our community who are dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2712.32)|
| 0:45:17| with substance use, mental health, or unhoused who need care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2717.52)|
| 0:45:21| And so this is why we're so passionate that alternative response could meet that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2721.6)|
| 0:45:26| If you go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2726.16)|
| 0:45:29| So what does an alternative response team respond to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2729.12)|
| 0:45:32| What kind of calls are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2732.08)|
| 0:45:33| And I want to say, so this is data pulled from CAHOOTS, which, again, they've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2733.44)|
| 0:45:37| this for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2737.2799999999997)|
| 0:45:38| What we're proposing is a pilot program, which means we don't have to respond to all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2738.72)|
| 0:45:43| types of calls right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2743.12)|
| 0:45:44| We can prioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2744.64)|
| 0:45:46| But this is a vision of what an alternative response team could do in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2746.08)|
| 0:45:52| So the first is they respond to mental health crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2752.16)|
| 0:45:55| They can provide things like psychological first aid, crisis care, and de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2755.04)|
| 0:46:00| They can provide substance use counseling and also dispute mediation and conflict resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2760.48)|
| 0:46:05| There's so many times where, you know, tensions are high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2765.68)|
| 0:46:08| People are having a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2768.4)|
| 0:46:09| And if that can be safely de-escalated, people can go on their own way, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2769.7599999999998)|
| 0:46:14| So this mental health crisis, that's where that behavioral health professional really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2774.56)|
| 0:46:17| shines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2777.8399999999997)|
| 0:46:18| Then we look at basic needs and assistance, things like providing food, water, socks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2778.88)|
| 0:46:23| basic supplies, also first aid and non-emergency medical care, things like wound care, basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2783.2799999999997)|
| 0:46:28| first aid, and transportation to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2788.96)|
| 0:46:31| So this is where that EMT or medic really takes the lead, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2791.52)|
| 0:46:35| And then we look at social services and community support, doing things like welfare checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2795.6)|
| 0:46:40| and connecting people to resources and other referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2800.4)|
| 0:46:44| So this is that sort of case management piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2804.48)|
| 0:46:47| And then the last is general public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2807.36)|
| 0:46:49| So things like grief and loss counseling or supporting other first responders when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2809.52)|
| 0:46:54| call for alternative response team backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2814.16)|
| 0:46:56| One thing that happened in Denver is they had this pilot program Denver Star going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2816.7200000000003)|
| 0:47:01| and the police officer started going, can we have more of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2821.12)|
| 0:47:04| Because, like, we want to call them for backup all the time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2824.4)|
| 0:47:07| So this is, again, this is something that, like, is not, there's no animosity between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2827.68)|
| 0:47:12| any other programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2832.24)|
| 0:47:13| This is, like, fitting in another service that could help in our community and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2833.2799999999997)|
| 0:47:17| can work collaboratively with our other systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2837.8399999999997)|
| 0:47:20| So we can go to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2840.7999999999997)|
| 0:47:22| So what is it that we are proposing as Knoxville Heart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2842.48)|
| 0:47:25| What we would really like to see is assembling a task force with key community stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2845.2)|
| 0:47:30| to plan an alternative response pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2850.7999999999997)|
| 0:47:34| Cookville, actually, has just gone through this planning process, and I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2854.48)|
| 0:47:39| took them, don't quote me on this, but about a year to plan their own alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2859.68)|
| 0:47:44| team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2864.64)|
| 0:47:44| And so it takes time to bring everyone together and figure out how do we want to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2864.96)|
| 0:47:49| happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2869.2)|
| 0:47:50| So part of what that task force would do is identify a community partner or an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2870.16)|
| 0:47:56| with the necessary values and commitment to nonpolice response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2876.4)|
| 0:48:00| So we really need an organization that shows, like, we understand the trauma-informed care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2880.2400000000002)|
| 0:48:05| the harm reduction, and we understand why it is so essential that police not be responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2885.36)|

| 1:01:26| And so, moving forward, if there's something that you guys want us to data mine or to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3686.4)|
| 1:01:33| for in the future calls for service or what we do in protocols, it has to be forward instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3693.28)|
| 1:01:39| of looking back because there's no way we can data mine what you're kind of looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3699.76)|
| 1:01:43| for in a non-police response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3703.52)|
| 1:01:47| And for us, we would have to have, that response would have to come from, or that protocol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3707.44)|
| 1:01:53| would have to come from the city or the county or both through an MOU because we're liable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3713.28)|
| 1:01:58| for the services we provide as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3718.8)|
| 1:02:01| And so, whoever we're referring clients, citizens to, we'd have to have an MOU through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3721.44)|

| 1:02:25| But to understand our role, we respond or send out dispatch based on protocols that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3745.36)|
| 1:02:31| are set by the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3751.6800000000003)|
| 1:02:32| So, we can't, anybody, anything that we send out has to be sanctioned by one of those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3752.96)|

| 1:02:43| Technically, by state law, we have, in Knoxville, we've got a great system where initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3763.92)|
| 1:02:51| the money that we collect through the phone tariff is for the 911 call and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3771.2799999999997)|
| 1:02:57| and the city pay us separately for dispatch services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3777.04)|
| 1:02:59| And so, that has to happen on that side of the house for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3779.52)|
| 1:03:02| But we're more than willing to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3782.72)|

| 1:04:11| And you all know how to text us, call us, holler at us, you know, the whole nine yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3851.68)|
| 1:04:17| But this just is a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3857.8399999999997)|
| 1:04:21| I was honored to serve as a national co-chair of a national task force this year, looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3861.04)|
| 1:04:29| at mental health and employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3869.6)|
| 1:04:31| And it was legislators from all over the country coming and looking at these very issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3871.7599999999998)|
| 1:04:37| So, it's just something that we all need to continue to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3877.92)|
| 1:04:42| Unfortunately, our mental health needs in our community are increasing exponentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3882.72)|
| 1:04:49| And we just need to, it's kind of like a whack-a-mole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3889.2)|
| 1:04:52| You kind of hit it one place and it pops up another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3892.24)|
| 1:04:55| But we just need to keep working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3895.28)|
| 1:04:57| And I think working on it collectively is the way to get things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3897.12)|
| 1:05:02| And I apologize that we're kind of double committed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3902.96)|
| 1:05:06| We've got another forum-type thing that I think virtually all of us have to be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3906.96)|
| 1:05:12| So, I'm sorry we've got to leave because I'd rather stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3912.4)|
| 1:05:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3915.92)|

| 1:05:21| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3921.92)|
| 1:05:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3926.32)|
| 1:05:26| We'll move along to history of local mental health continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3926.64)|
| 1:05:31| And we've got Ben Harrington with the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3931.2)|
| 1:05:36| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3936.2400000000002)|
| 1:05:37| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3937.2000000000003)|
| 1:05:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3937.5200000000004)|
| 1:05:39| I am Ben Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3939.92)|
| 1:05:40| I'm the CEO of the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3940.88)|
| 1:05:44| It's a position I've held for 29 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3944.2400000000002)|
| 1:05:46| So, by virtue of having more gray hair than probably anyone in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3946.5600000000004)|
| 1:05:51| that's why I have the historic piece today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3951.2000000000003)|
| 1:05:55| Let's lay the landscape, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3955.6800000000003)|
| 1:05:58| The federal data, which was not updated because of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3958.32)|
| 1:06:02| suggests one in five people in Knox County and in the city of Knoxville would need mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3962.0)|
| 1:06:10| The CDC did have some updated information during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3970.8)|
| 1:06:15| which showed about 37 percent of adults were dealing with anxiety symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3975.28)|
| 1:06:21| and 41 percent of adults were dealing with depressive symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3981.44)|
| 1:06:25| Also, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce would report that 50 percent of employees nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3985.68)|
| 1:06:34| are struggling with their mental health as a result of some of the pandemic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3994.08)|
| 1:06:40| The longer those things persist, then they get into my arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4000.3199999999997)|
| 1:06:44| then they get into McNabb's arena and the private sector mental health arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4004.72)|
| 1:06:49| because the symptoms don't necessarily recede.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4009.68)|
| 1:06:52| What we can tell you is 50 percent of all mental illness starts by age 14, 75 percent by age 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4012.96)|
| 1:07:01| and the children actually have the longest wait time to enter treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4021.36)|
| 1:07:09| It's called treatment delay, and their wait time can be easily more than a decade or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4029.84)|
| 1:07:15| before they get into treatment, from start of symptom to start of treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4035.2)|
| 1:07:20| That's what the landscape looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4040.32)|
| 1:07:25| I could talk about history of mental health in Knox County for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4045.6)|
| 1:07:29| so I'm going to try to condense this into 15 minutes, and it's going to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4049.92)|
| 1:07:34| Our history actually starts before the Civil War, when a captain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4054.88)|
| 1:07:38| who served in the Revolutionary War bought this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4058.56)|
| 1:07:41| His name was William Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4061.52)|
| 1:07:43| He bought it from the Cherokee Indian tribe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4063.12)|
| 1:07:46| and then his daughters, after the Civil War, sold it to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4066.8)|
| 1:07:50| The state would start construction multiple times and run out of money multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4070.48)|
| 1:07:56| Eventually, we get a piece of property that looked like this in the early to mid-1900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4076.4)|
| 1:08:03| That's what was called Eastern State Asylum, if you will, and you can see it's pretty big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4083.04)|
| 1:08:10| It's pretty big because there are lots of ways people could get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4090.32)|
| 1:08:14| what was the state asylum in those days, and some of them weren't very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4094.56)|
| 1:08:20| If a husband was mad at a wife, or someone wanted to steal nice farmland from a relative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4100.32)|
| 1:08:27| if they knew officials, they could grease bombs and get that person committed to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4107.68)|
| 1:08:34| We ended up having more than 2,000 people in this property at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4114.4)|
| 1:08:38| What I will tell you is, back in the day, there were also a lot of private sanatoriums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4118.96)|
| 1:08:45| or asylums all across Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4125.92)|
| 1:08:48| If you went to UT and you've walked past the torchbearer, right at that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4128.4800000000005)|
| 1:08:52| there was a private asylum or sanatorium run by a physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4132.56)|
| 1:08:58| There were lots of them all across town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4138.080000000001)|
| 1:09:00| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4140.240000000001)|
| 1:09:02| Let's go past World War II, when a lot of folks came back from the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4142.64)|
| 1:09:06| Some were traumatized from their experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4146.64)|
| 1:09:09| Some people had served in health care services in the war,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4149.68)|
| 1:09:13| and they knew there could indeed be services in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4153.4400000000005)|
| 1:09:17| So there was a call for building community mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4157.92)|
| 1:09:23| I apologize for the typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4163.68)|
| 1:09:25| It was 1946 when Mrs. McNabb and other volunteers in the community approached the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4165.12)|
| 1:09:31| and asked for funds to start a children's mental health clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4171.84)|
| 1:09:35| It would open in 1948, and eventually in the same year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4175.68)|
| 1:09:40| they would realize they needed an independent organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4180.96)|
| 1:09:44| to advocate for building mental health services in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4184.8)|
| 1:09:48| That independent organization was created separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4188.96)|
| 1:09:52| and that is the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4192.72)|
| 1:09:56| So our roots go back that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4196.96)|
| 1:09:59| But in the next few decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4199.360000000001)|
| 1:10:02| the earliest stages of building a mental health system in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4202.16)|
| 1:10:06| and in East Tennessee really started to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4206.08)|
| 1:10:09| 1953, Mrs. McNabb, our board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4209.2)|
| 1:10:12| and the board members from the MHA in Nashville lobbied legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4212.639999999999)|
| 1:10:18| and said, let's get mental health out of the Department of Corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4218.639999999999)|
| 1:10:22| So the State Department of Mental Health was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4222.4)|
| 1:10:25| And then later in the same decade, you would see other places start to open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4225.5199999999995)|
| 1:10:30| like in Ridgeview, or in Oak Ridge, excuse me, Ridgeview opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4230.64)|
| 1:10:34| It's a mental health center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4234.72)|
| 1:10:36| In the late 50s, the League of Women Voters in Morristown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4236.72)|
| 1:10:42| would open Cherokee Health System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4242.4800000000005)|
| 1:10:47| And of course, it would be a while before Cherokee would move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4247.360000000001)|
| 1:10:49| any offices and services to Knoxville, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4249.92)|
| 1:10:53| 1963, this fellow here, President John Kennedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4253.68)|
| 1:10:58| signs the Mental Health Center Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4258.96)|
| 1:11:00| and it was designed to help fund the development of mental health centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4260.5599999999995)|
| 1:11:04| all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4264.639999999999)|
| 1:11:06| They ran out of money, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4266.4)|
| 1:11:08| Not surprisingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4268.48)|
| 1:11:10| But also in the 60s, we started Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4270.0)|
| 1:11:12| And then that meant we had to educate physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4272.96)|
| 1:11:20| at graduate schools of medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4280.16)|
| 1:11:21| And so part of that meant some of those dollars were going to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4281.759999999999)|
| 1:11:25| Over time, those dollars receded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4285.28)|
| 1:11:27| And that's one of the big factors in a psychiatry shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4287.6)|
| 1:11:32| that we still see today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4292.240000000001)|
| 1:11:33| Not enough people going in to those graduate school programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4293.360000000001)|
| 1:11:36| Late 60s, you start to see scandals arise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4296.72)|
| 1:11:41| at some of the state hospitals across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4301.04)|
| 1:11:44| And that leads to the deinstitutionalization movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4304.08)|

| 1:12:08| And that caused a scandal here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4328.4)|
| 1:12:12| and caused some reforms to clean up Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4332.639999999999)|
| 1:12:15| and actually get all of the state hospitals on the path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4335.2)|
| 1:12:18| to being accredited and getting on a path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4338.32)|

| 1:12:33| in the early 90s and created mobile crisis services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4353.2)|

| 1:12:41| So I'm going to share some pivotal moments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4361.44)|
| 1:12:43| that I think you all might be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4363.76)|
| 1:12:47| or might not be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4367.5199999999995)|
| 1:12:49| In 1994, the state started TenCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4369.36)|
| 1:12:52| TenCare actually is the largest Medicaid expansion ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4372.64)|
| 1:12:56| in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4376.4800000000005)|
| 1:12:58| And it was launched in 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4378.320000000001)|
| 1:13:02| It invoked managed care principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4382.88)|
| 1:13:04| and service limits for recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4384.88)|
| 1:13:10| But it also enacted some other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4390.88)|
| 1:13:13| UT Medical Center and Children's Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4393.52)|
| 1:13:15| both had small psychiatric units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4395.6)|
| 1:13:19| And because they didn't get funded in TenCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4399.4400000000005)|
| 1:13:22| those things closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4402.72)|
| 1:13:24| Then Baptist Hospital, Blunt Memorial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4404.56)|
| 1:13:27| didn't have TenCare contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4407.92)|
| 1:13:29| And Baptist got closed after it merged with St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4409.84)|
| 1:13:34| And Blunt Memorial is struggling to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4414.8)|
| 1:13:37| And St. Mary's ended up closing its unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4417.68)|
| 1:13:40| One of the things that Tennessee had was a waived IMD rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4420.96)|
| 1:13:45| This thing is kind of sexy at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4425.84)|
| 1:13:48| Institutes for Mental Disease is the IMD letters of the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4428.8)|
| 1:13:53| And what it did not allow was use of federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4433.76)|
| 1:13:59| to pay for inpatient care at state hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4439.6)|
| 1:14:04| Tennessee, when it negotiated the TenCare waiver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4444.08)|
| 1:14:06| got that waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4446.72)|
| 1:14:08| And then what happened afterwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4448.32)|
| 1:14:10| was every state in the country would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4450.0)|
| 1:14:12| keep lobbying to get permission for their state to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4452.400000000001)|
| 1:14:15| And eventually, the feds had to say, uh-uh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4455.76)|
| 1:14:18| We're tapping out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4458.0)|
| 1:14:19| And we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4459.280000000001)|
| 1:14:20| So they had to turn to Tennessee and rescind that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4460.72)|
| 1:14:26| That literally led to the huge disenrollments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4466.4800000000005)|
| 1:14:30| in TenCare in the 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4470.56)|
| 1:14:34| So it led to safety enrollment cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4474.8)|
| 1:14:37| It would lead to the behavioral health safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4477.360000000001)|
| 1:14:40| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4480.16)|
| 1:14:42| So another pivotal moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4482.8)|
| 1:14:45| My colleague to my right talked about law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4485.76)|
| 1:14:48| interactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4488.96)|
| 1:14:49| And Knoxville has had an interesting history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4489.92)|
| 1:14:54| Sometimes those law enforcement interactions have gone well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4494.24)|
| 1:14:58| Sometimes they have not gone well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4498.56)|
| 1:15:00| And we have to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4500.4800000000005)|
| 1:15:02| But in the 1990s, law enforcement training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4502.24)|
| 1:15:05| was really kind of skewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4505.4400000000005)|
| 1:15:09| Folks in the recruit school got 12 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4509.04)|
| 1:15:11| of mental health training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4511.6)|
| 1:15:12| 10 of those hours were on psychopathic and sociopathic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4512.96)|
| 1:15:16| behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4516.24)|
| 1:15:17| Only two hours were on mobile crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4517.04)|
| 1:15:19| So what it's literally telling new officers is, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4519.28)|
| 1:15:23| Everyone you're going to encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4523.52)|
| 1:15:24| is either a psychopath or a sociopath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4524.96)|
| 1:15:27| And that's really over-skewing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4527.36)|
| 1:15:30| Because the illnesses are real, diagnosable, and treatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4530.24)|
| 1:15:33| And most people with mental illnesses live in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4533.6)|
| 1:15:36| They're your family members, your friends, your colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4536.8)|
| 1:15:39| your neighbors, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4539.04)|
| 1:15:40| So it was over-skewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4540.32)|
| 1:15:42| To his credit, Victor Ashe, at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4542.96)|
| 1:15:45| agreed we needed to reform police training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4545.84)|
| 1:15:49| And so we led a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4549.2)|
| 1:15:51| The MHA led a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4551.28)|
| 1:15:53| And we ended up incorporating a PERF model, a Police Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4553.52)|
| 1:15:58| Research Forum model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4558.16)|
| 1:15:59| 24 hours of training, highly involving family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4559.52)|
| 1:16:04| persons with lived experience, and colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4564.24)|
| 1:16:06| like our friends here at MCDAB Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4566.84)|
| 1:16:11| to provide the right type of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4571.2)|
| 1:16:13| so officers could understand mental illness better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4573.36)|
| 1:16:16| so they could recognize it, so then they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4576.08)|
| 1:16:18| start the diversion process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4578.48)|
| 1:16:21| That is a precursor for all sorts of good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4581.5199999999995)|
| 1:16:23| that would happen later, as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4583.92)|
| 1:16:26| It would lead to CIT training becoming embraced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4586.4)|
| 1:16:30| It would lead to the chief, Dave Roush there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4590.88)|
| 1:16:36| He was on our board at one time when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4596.24)|
| 1:16:38| he agreed to making sure that every police recruit got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4598.96)|
| 1:16:43| de-escalation training moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4603.4)|
| 1:16:46| And that's a big deal, because every officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4606.0)|
| 1:16:48| needs to have that de-escalation training so that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4608.96)|
| 1:16:52| de-escalate situations as best as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4612.24)|
| 1:16:55| And so it did also lead, eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4615.44)|
| 1:16:57| to the BHUC being established and the co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4617.4)|
| 1:17:01| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4621.24)|
| 1:17:03| So another pivotal moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4623.64)|
| 1:17:05| This document dated 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4625.88)|
| 1:17:09| So what we found out after a year of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4629.84)|
| 1:17:14| was the RMHI task force realized that a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4634.72)|
| 1:17:20| were being admitted to state hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4640.6)|
| 1:17:22| and they didn't need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4642.92)|
| 1:17:25| A lot of people with one to three day lengths of stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4645.24)|
| 1:17:27| meant their situation, their crisis, was not that acute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4647.76)|
| 1:17:31| And it meant that we could do something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4651.8)|
| 1:17:34| in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4654.0)|
| 1:17:35| So this is the line in the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4655.580000000001)|
| 1:17:37| Before then, crisis services needed lots of help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4657.72)|
| 1:17:40| needed more funding, was not nearly as robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4660.64)|
| 1:17:43| as it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4663.320000000001)|
| 1:17:44| It was the favorite place to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4664.52)|
| 1:17:46| whenever there were problems in the mental health system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4666.72)|
| 1:17:49| before this date, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4669.240000000001)|
| 1:17:51| After this date, let me tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4671.92)|
| 1:17:54| Tennessee has invested a ton of money in crisis services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4674.68)|
| 1:17:59| since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4679.84)|
| 1:18:00| I led the state planning council at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4680.96)|
| 1:18:04| when this came through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4684.08)|
| 1:18:05| And when this report came out the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4685.76)|
| 1:18:07| we got six more CSUs across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4687.76)|
| 1:18:10| We've added more CSUs since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4690.92)|
| 1:18:13| But we've also been able to add medically monitored detox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4693.08)|
| 1:18:16| units, crisis walk-ins, family crisis walk-ins, and of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4696.0)|
| 1:18:19| now our newest resource in town, the children's CSU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4699.92)|
| 1:18:26| I put 988 up there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4706.68)|
| 1:18:28| It's been in existence for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4708.96)|
| 1:18:31| But I do a lot of work with folks all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4711.52)|
| 1:18:34| And a lot of other states had to go to their legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4714.8)|
| 1:18:38| and fight to get a telephone fee to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4718.200000000001)|
| 1:18:42| for enhancing crisis services and building the 988 system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4722.400000000001)|
| 1:18:48| Tennessee is actually the envy of the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4728.4800000000005)|
| 1:18:51| because we started investing these dollars back in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4731.080000000001)|
| 1:18:56| building CSUs and additional crisis services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4736.8)|
| 1:18:59| Other states are just at that point now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4739.64)|
| 1:19:02| And they've got to start this whole list now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4742.6)|
| 1:19:05| So it's really a good situation for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4745.160000000001)|
| 1:19:08| and certainly indicative that times have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4748.320000000001)|
| 1:19:11| But that's a pivotal moment that I wanted to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4751.08)|
| 1:19:14| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4754.04)|
| 1:19:15| So another pivotal moment is in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4755.56)|
| 1:19:20| And this is a TenCare moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4760.8)|
| 1:19:22| And it's not a very good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4762.52)|
| 1:19:24| TenCare decided it was going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4764.360000000001)|
| 1:19:26| some models of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4766.12)|
| 1:19:28| Previously, we had case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4768.0)|
| 1:19:29| that was a very traditional form of case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4769.68)|
| 1:19:33| that supported individuals and supported their access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4773.36)|
| 1:19:36| to treatment and helped make sure folks got what they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4776.56)|
| 1:19:41| TenCare changed their model to a care coordination model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4781.0)|
| 1:19:43| that they call that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4783.92)|
| 1:19:45| But it's really about linking folks and referring them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4785.12)|
| 1:19:48| to stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4788.56)|
| 1:19:49| And that's not nearly as effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4789.68)|
| 1:19:51| So that's changed the level of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4791.72)|
| 1:19:56| for residents of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4796.96)|
| 1:19:59| So next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4799.12)|
| 1:20:02| So today's challenges, besides what I would naturally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4802.0)|
| 1:20:08| talk about, the need for early intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4808.6)|
| 1:20:10| Because as a parent, I wouldn't want anyone's kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4810.92)|
| 1:20:14| to have to go a decade or more before they get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4814.52)|
| 1:20:17| That's a big deal for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4817.88)|
| 1:20:19| And it always will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4819.44)|
| 1:20:20| But there are other needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4820.96)|
| 1:20:23| We constantly have folks that think, oh, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4823.6)|
| 1:20:25| Lakeshore closed in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4825.52)|
| 1:20:27| Let's just use that money all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4827.92)|
| 1:20:30| Well, the state has already done a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4830.320000000001)|
| 1:20:34| reinvesting those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4834.040000000001)|
| 1:20:35| And in fact, every nickel of the Lakeshore money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4835.4800000000005)|
| 1:20:39| got reinvested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4839.240000000001)|
| 1:20:40| And what they did was they ensured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4840.52)|
| 1:20:42| that the average number of people needing inpatient care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4842.360000000001)|
| 1:20:46| would still get care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4846.200000000001)|
| 1:20:47| So they contracted with private hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4847.320000000001)|
| 1:20:49| But then they took the remaining dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4849.4800000000005)|
| 1:20:51| and they contracted with other providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4851.4400000000005)|
| 1:20:53| And they said, tell us how you could use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4853.52)|
| 1:20:55| to serve more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4855.36)|
| 1:20:56| And literally, what the state got out of that deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4856.36)|
| 1:20:59| was $20.5 million, serving about 12,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4859.24)|
| 1:21:04| That's 2,000 people needing inpatient care and 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4864.28)|
| 1:21:07| more people that weren't getting served back in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4867.32)|
| 1:21:10| So that's really proven to be a strong investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4870.799999999999)|
| 1:21:14| However, I will tell you today that hospitals are struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4874.5199999999995)|
| 1:21:19| with staffed bed capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4879.2)|
| 1:21:20| That is going to be something you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4880.839999999999)|
| 1:21:22| hear about over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4882.719999999999)|
| 1:21:26| How many beds do we have in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4886.2)|
| 1:21:29| It's staffed bed capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4889.2)|
| 1:21:31| Because you can have 100 beds, but if you're only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4891.4)|
| 1:21:34| staffed at 50, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4894.04)|
| 1:21:36| We're not using those other 50 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4896.16)|
| 1:21:38| So that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4898.16)|
| 1:21:40| We thought that could change some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4900.639999999999)|
| 1:21:42| with two private hospitals opening last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4902.16)|
| 1:21:46| And they're both off of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4906.48)|
| 1:21:48| One's the Knoxville Center for Behavioral Medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4908.4)|
| 1:21:50| One is the East Tennessee Behavioral Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4910.88)|
| 1:21:53| They're private and they're for-profit hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4913.8)|
| 1:21:57| They take commercial insurance, and they're doing OK there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4917.52)|
| 1:22:01| They do take some TennCare, and they're losing their shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4921.56)|
| 1:22:04| They're losing about $150 a day for every TennCare patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4924.52)|
| 1:22:08| they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4928.320000000001)|
| 1:22:09| So that is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4929.12)|
| 1:22:10| And it's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4930.92)|
| 1:22:12| At some point, they might have to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4932.2)|
| 1:22:13| no, we're not doing it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4933.92)|
| 1:22:16| They also don't serve the uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4936.88)|
| 1:22:18| That is something we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4938.96)|
| 1:22:21| And so we can't be clearer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4941.76)|
| 1:22:24| Right now, the uninsured, they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4944.8)|
| 1:22:26| supposed to go to Peninsula Ridgeview, maybe Woodridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4946.24)|
| 1:22:30| up in Johnson City, or failing any of that democasin bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4950.92)|
| 1:22:36| The staffed bed problem is an issue at Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4956.400000000001)|
| 1:22:41| And hence, we don't have access to all the beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4961.280000000001)|
| 1:22:43| that they've got licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4963.360000000001)|
| 1:22:45| So that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4965.360000000001)|
| 1:22:46| The other thing that I want to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4966.64)|
| 1:22:49| and this was one that really concerned me a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4969.4400000000005)|
| 1:22:53| as we were hearing about the new hospitals coming along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4973.160000000001)|
| 1:22:55| and stuff, they've got to staff them somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4975.68)|
| 1:22:58| So where are they going to get their doctors, and nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4978.4800000000005)|
| 1:23:01| and social workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4981.400000000001)|
| 1:23:02| And long story short, you can't stop them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4982.88)|
| 1:23:05| from looking at applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4985.120000000001)|
| 1:23:08| If Amelia decides she wants to look at a job posting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4988.160000000001)|
| 1:23:11| they can't stop her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4991.280000000001)|
| 1:23:14| But so there was a little bit of movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4994.320000000001)|
| 1:23:16| from one facility to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4996.120000000001)|
| 1:23:19| That exacerbated the staffed hospital bed capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4999.12)|
| 1:23:24| at some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5004.72)|
| 1:23:26| The other thing I would say to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5006.72)|
| 1:23:28| is you will hear more about the behavioral health workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5008.72)|

| 1:35:09| you'll see the percentage increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5709.32)|
| 1:35:11| It's about 500% in the past 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5711.360000000001)|
| 1:35:15| And again, this is why I started my talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5715.08)|
| 1:35:17| with expressing appreciation for folks in the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5717.08)|
| 1:35:20| because they continue to invest in this important work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5720.360000000001)|
| 1:35:23| I'd also be remiss to say that our team back at the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5723.32)|
| 1:35:27| are very successful in writing federal grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5727.4400000000005)|
| 1:35:29| so we get a lot of federal grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5729.8)|
| 1:35:31| whether it be through SAMHSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5731.4800000000005)|
| 1:35:33| through the Department of Justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5733.08)|
| 1:35:35| and we don't keep that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5735.0)|
| 1:35:36| That money comes to local communities like Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5736.4400000000005)|
| 1:35:39| so this is something that we're really proud to report on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5739.120000000001)|
| 1:35:42| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5742.72)|
| 1:35:44| Ty is going to talk more at length here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5744.56)|
| 1:35:46| about our hospitals post-lakeshore closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5746.120000000001)|
| 1:35:48| If you go to the next slide, though, this is a —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5748.8)|
| 1:35:51| we call this the Senator Massey spreadsheet at the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5751.040000000001)|
| 1:35:53| because it breaks down how each of the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5753.88)|
| 1:35:56| that we committed to maintaining in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5756.68)|
| 1:35:59| from the lakeshore closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5759.84)|
| 1:36:01| it's just a little north of $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5761.68)|
| 1:36:03| continues to be funded for these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5763.84)|
| 1:36:06| that were identified by the community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5766.4400000000005)|
| 1:36:09| subsequent to the closure of Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5769.16)|
| 1:36:11| You can see from this slide that we break it down by year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5771.24)|
| 1:36:15| so you'll see each year the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5775.360000000001)|
| 1:36:17| who are being served in these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5777.8)|
| 1:36:20| If you will, if you go to maybe the last slide on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5780.8)|
| 1:36:25| yes, the bottom-line numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5785.08)|
| 1:36:26| is what I would point your attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5786.4800000000005)|
| 1:36:28| So in FY13, there were 46,259 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5788.56)|
| 1:36:33| served through these programs, through these reinvestments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5793.32)|
| 1:36:36| In FY22, we're still finalizing some of the 23 data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5796.5199999999995)|
| 1:36:40| but in FY22, 86,982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5800.32)|
| 1:36:45| So more people are being served here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5805.4)|
| 1:36:47| in Knox County post-lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5807.5199999999995)|
| 1:36:49| So at this point, I'm going to turn it over to my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5809.599999999999)|
| 1:36:52| Chief of Staff Ty Thornton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5812.0)|
| 1:36:54| Thank you. Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5814.96)|
| 1:37:01| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5821.0)|
| 1:37:02| As Matt, my colleague, was saying, my name's Ty Thornton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5822.2)|
| 1:37:05| and I serve as the department's Chief of Staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5825.4)|
| 1:37:08| and Chief of Hospital Operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5828.96)|
| 1:37:11| So I've been with the department for about 13 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5831.32)|
| 1:37:14| and I will say that it has drastically changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5834.28)|
| 1:37:18| in those 13 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5838.64)|
| 1:37:20| and I would not want to work anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5840.64)|
| 1:37:23| I really, really have a heart for what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5843.32)|
| 1:37:27| and we're going to continue to do great things in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5847.76)|
| 1:37:32| I just want to be a part of that, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5852.76)|
| 1:37:36| But if you could go ahead and move to the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5856.2)|
| 1:37:39| the slide after that would be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5859.76)|
| 1:37:42| This is going to show you the comparison here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5862.76)|
| 1:37:45| of private, contracted, and state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5865.400000000001)|
| 1:37:48| Regional Mental Health Institute admissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5868.04)|
| 1:37:50| from the former Lakeshore Catchment Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5870.6)|
| 1:37:53| which was a 24-county catchment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5873.4400000000005)|
| 1:37:56| Lakeshore, the last year that it was in operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5876.4800000000005)|
| 1:37:59| was fiscal year 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5879.040000000001)|
| 1:38:02| There were 2,237 admissions to Lakeshore during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5882.240000000001)|
| 1:38:08| I'm sorry, during FY11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5888.6)|
| 1:38:12| And in this last fiscal year that ended June 30th, 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5892.4800000000005)|
| 1:38:18| there were a total of 2,801 admissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5898.4400000000005)|
| 1:38:23| So as you can see, admissions from the former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5903.24)|
| 1:38:26| Lakeshore Catchment Area, FY11 to today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5906.639999999999)|
| 1:38:31| there's 25% more individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5911.96)|
| 1:38:36| who are receiving inpatient psychiatric services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5916.36)|
| 1:38:40| than whenever Lakeshore was in operation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5920.12)|
| 1:38:43| And it's broken down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5923.679999999999)|
| 1:38:45| That's obviously not our total admissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5925.5199999999995)|
| 1:38:48| on that right-hand side from all of the catchment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5928.12)|
| 1:38:51| That is just specific to the 24-county catchment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5931.4800000000005)|
| 1:38:55| that Lakeshore formerly served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5935.76)|
| 1:38:58| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5938.4800000000005)|
| 1:39:00| Okay, so if you look at the statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5940.240000000001)|
| 1:39:02| psych hospital bed availability, this is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5942.68)|
| 1:39:07| Because, you know, we look at what we were at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5947.6)|
| 1:39:10| in this calendar year, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5950.160000000001)|
| 1:39:12| That was 2,509 psychiatric hospital beds in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5952.72)|
| 1:39:20| And then 2021, the reason I say 2021 is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5960.36)|
| 1:39:24| we call it the JAR report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5964.04)|
| 1:39:25| It's the Joint Annual Report on Hospitals that's released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5965.32)|
| 1:39:29| And it's going to be about two years in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5969.5599999999995)|
| 1:39:32| based on data, that's about two years in arrears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5972.36)|
| 1:39:34| So the most recent report was released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5974.719999999999)|
| 1:39:38| by Department of Health and THA in October 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5978.0)|
| 1:39:42| So we'll give it a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5982.799999999999)|
| 1:39:44| and we should have a new report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5984.12)|
| 1:39:46| that'll be based on 2022 data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5986.2)|
| 1:39:48| But that was a 36.23% increase from 2011 to 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5988.72)|
| 1:39:57| So there at the end of that note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5997.56)|
| 1:39:59| I want to point out the fact that there's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5999.400000000001)|
| 1:40:03| approximately 700, I'd say 700 or 750,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6003.52)|
| 1:40:08| unstaffed beds in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6008.04)|
| 1:40:11| So that means that the hospital is licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6011.0)|
| 1:40:14| to operate 3,418 beds there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6014.84)|
| 1:40:20| but about 700 of those are currently offline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6020.28)|
| 1:40:24| for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6024.24)|
| 1:40:25| But one of the biggest reasons is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6025.32)|
| 1:40:28| we can't staff all the beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6028.32)|
| 1:40:29| You can have all the beds that you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6029.84)|
| 1:40:32| but if you can't staff them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6032.64)|
| 1:40:34| they're not really any good to you for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6034.4800000000005)|
| 1:40:38| All right, so moving to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6038.56)|
| 1:40:43| Okay, so Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute admissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6043.12)|
| 1:40:47| from the 24 county area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6047.08)|
| 1:40:50| that was formerly served by Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6050.08)|
| 1:40:53| I would have put in the numbers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6053.08)|
| 1:40:54| but it was going to all run together if I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6054.64)|
| 1:40:57| So I'll just give you the last two numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6057.64)|
| 1:40:59| here for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6059.88)|
| 1:41:01| As you can see, that is the largest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6061.32)|
| 1:41:05| I'm sorry, the largest admissions county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6065.84)|
| 1:41:08| that we have for the 24 county catchment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6068.5599999999995)|
| 1:41:12| It stayed fairly consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6072.84)|
| 1:41:14| In FY22, there were 248 admissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6074.320000000001)|
| 1:41:19| to Moccasin Bend from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6079.360000000001)|
| 1:41:23| That number for the last fiscal year for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6083.4800000000005)|
| 1:41:26| I guess, FY23 is 242.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6086.8)|
| 1:41:32| So from 248 to 242.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6092.080000000001)|
| 1:41:36| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6096.72)|
| 1:41:38| All right, so going on to the total number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6098.56)|
| 1:41:41| of individuals who are transported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6101.92)|
| 1:41:44| by the Knox County Sheriff to Moccasin Bend in FY23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6104.52)|
| 1:41:49| As you can see there on the far right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6109.8)|
| 1:41:51| there were 253 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6111.6)|
| 1:41:55| who were transported to Moccasin Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6115.16)|
| 1:41:58| and only 11 of those were not admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6118.4)|
| 1:42:01| So that's approximately one individual a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6121.84)|
| 1:42:05| and I'd say less than 5% were not admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6125.56)|
| 1:42:09| That's still too many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6129.16)|
| 1:42:10| and we are working to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6130.72)|
| 1:42:13| Whenever they have to go down to Moccasin Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6133.6)|
| 1:42:16| to Chattanooga, and an individual is not admitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6136.240000000001)|
| 1:42:20| that obviously takes time and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6140.360000000001)|
| 1:42:22| So in order to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6142.92)|
| 1:42:25| what we've tried to do is we've implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6145.040000000001)|
| 1:42:27| a large initiative that deals with telehealth evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6147.000000000001)|
| 1:42:31| So I'll get to that in just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6151.040000000001)|
| 1:42:32| but that's the reason why we've been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6152.88)|
| 1:42:34| to get that down to 11 non-admits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6154.92)|
| 1:42:40| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6160.08)|
| 1:42:42| Okay, so the next slide shows you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6162.96)|
| 1:42:45| Knox County transports that are coming from the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6165.96)|
| 1:42:49| to Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute in FY23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6169.96)|
| 1:42:53| There were a total of 51 transports to Moccasin Bend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6173.599999999999)|
| 1:42:58| that originated from the jail in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6178.48)|
| 1:43:01| 22 of those were forensic patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6181.84)|
| 1:43:05| So forensic would be competency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6185.599999999999)|
| 1:43:08| like court-ordered competency evaluations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6188.68)|
| 1:43:11| or mental capacity at the time of the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6191.0)|
| 1:43:14| Those type of inmates who are facing criminal charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6194.72)|
| 1:43:21| they go to Moccasin Bend for up to 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6201.0)|
| 1:43:23| for inpatient forensic evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6203.16)|
| 1:43:27| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6207.64)|
| 1:43:30| Okay, this slide here is East Tennessee private facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6210.52)|
| 1:43:35| the total discharges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6215.16)|
| 1:43:36| So it's gonna show you the number of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6216.4800000000005)|
| 1:43:38| who were served by the three contract hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6218.72)|
| 1:43:42| We've got Peninsula, we've got Ridgeview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6222.56)|
| 1:43:45| and then we've got Woodridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6225.200000000001)|
| 1:43:46| So in fiscal year 23, I mean, as you can see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6226.96)|
| 1:43:52| the numbers have decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6232.200000000001)|
| 1:43:54| but it certainly decreased the totals there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6234.160000000001)|
| 1:43:56| But so for FY23, it was a total of 2,127 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6236.360000000001)|
| 1:44:02| served by the three contract hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6242.360000000001)|
| 1:44:09| That number has decreased from FY22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6249.120000000001)|
| 1:44:11| where there was 2,495 individuals served there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6251.84)|
| 1:44:18| We attribute that to the investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6258.080000000001)|
| 1:44:21| that our department has been able to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6261.960000000001)|
| 1:44:25| in community services and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6265.400000000001)|
| 1:44:28| We're gonna continue to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6268.76)|
| 1:44:30| because the data tells us that it's definitely working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6270.2)|
| 1:44:34| Whenever you have the most restrictive resource out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6274.92)|
| 1:44:41| with fewer admissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6281.88)|
| 1:44:44| and then you see that our community supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6284.44)|
| 1:44:47| are actually thriving on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6287.4)|
| 1:44:49| So next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6289.96)|
| 1:44:52| All right, so East Tennessee private facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6292.5199999999995)|
| 1:44:56| uninsured average length of stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6296.72)|
| 1:44:59| So average length of stay for these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6299.6)|
| 1:45:03| is shown there for FY23 on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6303.4800000000005)|
| 1:45:06| Collectively, that would be about 4.83| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6306.4400000000005)|
| 1:45:11| is the average length of stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6311.72)|
| 1:45:13| So right at five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6313.400000000001)|
| 1:45:16| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6316.92)|
| 1:45:18| All right, this shows you the total admissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6318.52)|
| 1:45:21| from FY2019 to FY2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6321.0)|
| 1:45:26| at all four of the regional mental health institutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6326.320000000001)|
| 1:45:30| This data also matches the data that we just saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6330.280000000001)|
| 1:45:33| for East Tennessee contract hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6333.200000000001)|
| 1:45:36| the discharges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6336.160000000001)|
| 1:45:37| As you can see, this actually does have the total there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6337.52)|
| 1:45:40| And we've continued to see a decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6340.4800000000005)|
| 1:45:44| in inpatient hospitalizations there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6344.000000000001)|
| 1:45:46| Again, we attribute that to the large investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6346.84)|
| 1:45:50| that we've been able to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6350.080000000001)|
| 1:45:51| in community services and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6351.400000000001)|
| 1:45:56| As you can also see there on the far right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6356.280000000001)|
| 1:45:58| I guess it's the maroon column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6358.8)|
| 1:46:02| Even though Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6362.6)|
| 1:46:05| is our largest facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6365.280000000001)|
| 1:46:07| Moccasin Bend in this last fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6367.120000000001)|
| 1:46:09| served the most, they had the most admissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6369.64)|
| 1:46:12| of any of the RMHIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6372.400000000001)|
| 1:46:14| So they're certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6374.360000000001)|
| 1:46:18| they're 2,349 individuals admitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6378.040000000001)|
| 1:46:22| to Moccasin Bend in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6382.240000000001)|
| 1:46:24| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6384.400000000001)|
| 1:46:26| All right, I will turn it back over to Matt Yancey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6386.56)|
| 1:46:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6388.96)|
| 1:46:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6390.72)|
| 1:46:34| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6394.56)|
| 1:46:36| You've heard about the Kids CSU here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6396.240000000001)|
| 1:46:39| I've been in Tennessee for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6399.400000000001)|
| 1:46:41| And since day one, we've been hearing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6401.280000000001)|
| 1:46:43| from people across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6403.88)|
| 1:46:44| that we need children's CSUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6404.84)|
| 1:46:48| McNabb and East Tennessee Children's Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6408.04)|
| 1:46:50| decided they were gonna do it on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6410.280000000001)|
| 1:46:51| And so they've done that successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6411.96)|
| 1:46:55| We were able, as a department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6415.56)|
| 1:46:57| to be able to help with some of the infrastructure funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6417.0)|
| 1:46:59| as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6419.6)|
| 1:47:00| But I feel like the program has been so successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6420.92)|
| 1:47:03| that this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6423.4400000000005)|
| 1:47:05| we've actually received funding to help stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6425.160000000001)|
| 1:47:07| two new children's CSUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6427.280000000001)|
| 1:47:09| one in the Middle Grand Division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6429.92)|
| 1:47:11| one in the West Grand Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6431.8)|

| 1:47:24| You've heard earlier about the empath unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6444.28)|
| 1:47:26| This was a directed appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6446.32)|
| 1:47:28| You can see the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6448.759999999999)|
| 1:47:30| that have flown through our department to this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6450.719999999999)|
| 1:47:33| for the empath unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6453.24)|
| 1:47:34| broken down by capital and operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6454.48)|
| 1:47:37| I believe this funding's in place for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6457.639999999999)|
| 1:47:40| Obviously, it will be at the St. Mary's campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6460.759999999999)|
| 1:47:43| This is gonna be a huge addition to the continuum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6463.599999999999)|
| 1:47:47| talking about sequential intercept mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6467.84)|
| 1:47:50| This is an intercept point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6470.4)|
| 1:47:52| And we are definitely looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6472.12)|
| 1:47:54| to seeing this open up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6474.04)|
| 1:47:55| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6475.88)|
| 1:47:57| Here recently, really within the past few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6477.64)|
| 1:48:01| our department's also funded McNabb Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6481.599999999999)|
| 1:48:04| with a $4 million one-time grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6484.48)|
| 1:48:07| to help expand their residential detox services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6487.28)|
| 1:48:11| I believe that's gonna be at Centerpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6491.16)|
| 1:48:13| if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6493.0)|
| 1:48:15| And the completion of these new beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6495.28)|
| 1:48:17| would be the end of June of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6497.04)|
| 1:48:21| As you can see, there's other providers here locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6501.28)|
| 1:48:23| that we have recently invested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6503.48)|
| 1:48:25| to help expand infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6505.5599999999995)|
| 1:48:27| So those are some key themes you're probably hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6507.4)|
| 1:48:30| We need more infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6510.16)|
| 1:48:31| We need more staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6511.8)|
| 1:48:33| The other thing that's not in these PowerPoint slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6513.639999999999)|
| 1:48:35| is that the legislature has provided our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6515.92)|
| 1:48:38| almost $40 million in the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6518.679999999999)|
| 1:48:41| for provider rate increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6521.12)|
| 1:48:44| As Ty mentioned, you can have the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6524.0)|
| 1:48:47| you can have the beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6527.2)|
| 1:48:48| but if you don't have the professionals to staff them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6528.2)|
| 1:48:52| you can't serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6532.12)|
| 1:48:53| And one of the things that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6533.599999999999)|
| 1:48:55| within the public behavioral health system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6535.04)|
| 1:48:56| is you've got professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6536.72)|
| 1:48:57| who have historically been woefully underpaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6537.8)|
| 1:49:00| for the important work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6540.36)|
| 1:49:01| So these provider rate increase funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6541.8)|
| 1:49:04| are going to all of our providers across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6544.76)|
| 1:49:07| An early indication is that it is helping with recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6547.5599999999995)|
| 1:49:10| and helping with retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6550.8)|
| 1:49:12| but we certainly have a lot more work to do on that front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6552.84)|
| 1:49:15| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6555.639999999999)|
| 1:49:17| I remember last year I was asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6557.12)|
| 1:49:18| about the Knox County Mental Health Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6558.84)|
| 1:49:21| I was speaking to our director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6561.16)|
| 1:49:22| of criminal justice programs earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6562.599999999999)|
| 1:49:25| Rebecca Provost-Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6565.36)|
| 1:49:27| She said that Judge Cerny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6567.32)|
| 1:49:29| will be overseeing the new mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6569.2)|
| 1:49:31| I know he's been with the recovery court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6571.36)|
| 1:49:33| here in Knox County for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6573.24)|
| 1:49:35| as well as the Veterans Treatment Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6575.5599999999995)|
| 1:49:37| And as you can see, referrals we're expecting to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6577.68)|
| 1:49:42| starting in mid-August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6582.08)|
| 1:49:44| This just is another example of Knox County leading the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6584.64)|
| 1:49:48| in trying to address people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6588.72)|
| 1:49:50| who interface with the justice system in a better way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6590.4400000000005)|
| 1:49:53| especially those who commit low-level nonviolent offenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6593.4800000000005)|

| 1:50:20| This gateway program is their new recovery community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6620.16)|
| 1:50:23| If you've not visited the recovery center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6623.88)|
| 1:50:26| I would encourage you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6626.72)|
| 1:50:29| You can see the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6629.0)|
| 1:50:30| that it provides to people in recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6630.2)|
| 1:50:32| This is a project that we also help fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6632.8)|
| 1:50:35| both with infrastructure dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6635.64)|

| 1:50:46| but we couldn't do any of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6646.68)|
| 1:50:47| without the partners that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6647.84)|

| 1:51:19| and lots of discussion they wanna have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6679.0)|
| 1:51:21| We're getting close to having been doing this for two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6681.32)|
| 1:51:24| which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6684.0)|
| 1:51:26| We had a lot of information to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6686.12)|
| 1:51:28| So we're gonna have three minutes by agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6688.16)|
| 1:51:31| from Chair Durette and myself for everyone to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6691.68)|
| 1:51:37| I would ask that everyone, when you do ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6697.52)|
| 1:51:40| make sure you turn on your lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6700.16)|
| 1:51:41| and I'll try to call on everybody as I see them come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6701.32)|
| 1:51:44| And we'll try to get everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6704.12)|

| 1:51:50| And if you could try to keep your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6710.92)|
| 1:51:53| to maybe not so many compound questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6713.88)|
| 1:51:56| but I wanna make sure I get to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6716.92)|

| 1:52:21| Commissioner Beeler, did you wanna say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6741.2)|
| 1:52:24| I would love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6744.16)|
| 1:52:25| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6745.0)|
| 1:52:26| I really don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6746.76)|
| 1:52:28| I just wanted to sort of give a summation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6748.4)|
| 1:52:31| of my thoughts and listening to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6751.72)|
| 1:52:33| and kudos to those who have presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6753.599999999999)|
| 1:52:36| and been represented by those who presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6756.5599999999995)|
| 1:52:38| because it's great to see how many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6758.84)|
| 1:52:42| are out there getting it done every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6762.56)|
| 1:52:45| And it's been really honestly amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6765.2)|
| 1:52:50| to hear about some of the services that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6770.24)|
| 1:52:53| and some of the services that are possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6773.8)|
| 1:52:57| and could be made available in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6777.2)|
| 1:53:00| Amazing and encouraging to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6780.84)|
| 1:53:03| how much the investment from the state has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6783.32)|
| 1:53:06| That was very enlightening over the past 10 to 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6786.92)|
| 1:53:12| I think it's easy to see that there is a lot being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6792.04)|
| 1:53:16| and there's a lot more being done than has ever been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6796.08)|
| 1:53:20| But I think it's also true that we need to do a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6800.08)|
| 1:53:25| And there are two words that have just really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6805.68)|
| 1:53:28| been reverberating in my spirit the past couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6808.68)|
| 1:53:31| and especially since yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6811.16)|
| 1:53:32| when I was talking with Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6812.68)|
| 1:53:35| And the two words are unity and urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6815.64)|
| 1:53:39| And I'm an optimist, okay, so maybe this is optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6819.240000000001)|
| 1:53:43| But I just really believe that this is an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6823.400000000001)|
| 1:53:46| that we can unify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6826.64)|
| 1:53:50| Like the Vice Mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6830.280000000001)|
| 1:53:53| we could make a laundry list of things we disagree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6833.96)|
| 1:53:57| There's probably not two people that agree on everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6837.52)|
| 1:54:01| in any of these bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6841.400000000001)|
| 1:54:02| But I think one thing we can agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6842.76)|
| 1:54:05| is that this is an issue, this is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6845.32)|
| 1:54:06| We have got to take on together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6846.88)|
| 1:54:11| and make real progress for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6851.0)|
| 1:54:13| And I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6853.52)|
| 1:54:15| The urgency piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6855.68)|
| 1:54:18| I still think there's an elephant in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6858.28)|
| 1:54:20| I still think there's a big missing piece of this puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6860.0)|
| 1:54:23| And General Nichols, I think, paved the way for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6863.4800000000005)|
| 1:54:27| by saying we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6867.0)|
| 1:54:30| And we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6870.76)|
| 1:54:32| And I really believe there is a desperate need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6872.16)|
| 1:54:38| for more government-funded and staffed beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6878.16)|
| 1:54:42| for long-term mental health inpatient treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6882.72)|
| 1:54:49| And I know staffing's an issue, that's part of the elephant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6889.12)|
| 1:54:52| And I know greater investments have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6892.48)|
| 1:54:54| that's all part of it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6894.8)|
| 1:54:56| But I believe Knox County will step up to the plate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6896.08)|
| 1:54:59| and do everything we can to do our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6899.56)|
| 1:55:02| I believe our colleagues at the city will do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6902.88)|
| 1:55:06| And, but the truth we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6906.56)|
| 1:55:09| is that in order to lift the whole elephant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6909.080000000001)|
| 1:55:10| we need the muscle of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6910.84)|
| 1:55:13| And so I'm confident and encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6913.6)|
| 1:55:15| by Senator Briggs and Senator Massey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6915.76)|
| 1:55:19| Governor McNally, Representative Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6919.56)|
| 1:55:21| Representative Zachary being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6921.8)|
| 1:55:23| And we all need to reach out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6923.92)|
| 1:55:26| and to Representative Johnson and Representative McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6926.240000000001)|
| 1:55:28| Representative Lafferty, Representative Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6928.56)|
| 1:55:30| all of us with a collective voice need to reach out and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6930.4800000000005)|
| 1:55:35| we need long-term government-staffed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6935.4800000000005)|

| 1:55:42| We are fast approaching a metropolitan area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6942.04)|
| 1:55:45| of a million people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6945.88)|
| 1:55:47| We are the third largest in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6947.72)|
| 1:55:49| We're not getting any smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6949.120000000001)|
| 1:55:50| In fact, we're probably gaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6950.360000000001)|
| 1:55:51| on one if not both of the two ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6951.68)|
| 1:55:54| If East Tennessee had a capital, it would be Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6954.120000000001)|

| 1:55:59| This region depends on Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6959.4400000000005)|
| 1:56:02| having the service available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6962.16)|
| 1:56:03| So I'm confident we're gonna move forward together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6963.36)|
| 1:56:05| and make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6965.4800000000005)|
| 1:56:06| So I'll yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6966.32)|
| 1:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6967.4800000000005)|

| 1:56:11| And I think we've heard a lot today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6971.4400000000005)|
| 1:56:14| from a variety of presentations that we heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6974.76)|
| 1:56:19| that really kind of make that very clear to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6979.0)|

| 1:56:27| I see Council Member Parker has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6987.16)|
| 1:56:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6992.76)|
| 1:56:35| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6995.96)|
| 1:56:38| And thank you to you and both Chair Durrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6998.68)|
| 1:56:42| for organizing this joint workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7002.0)|
| 1:56:46| I do feel like tonight we've had a really good conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7006.16)|
| 1:56:50| and it was helpful to get an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7010.52)|
| 1:56:55| since our last joint workshop on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7015.96)|
| 1:56:59| which I was not able to join you all last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7019.360000000001)|
| 1:57:02| I was under the weather, but actively watching at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7022.76)|
| 1:57:06| and a couple of times after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7026.88)|
| 1:57:10| And so there were a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7030.88)|
| 1:57:14| that stood out to me in this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7034.320000000001)|
| 1:57:17| particularly that the number of beds available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7037.92)|
| 1:57:23| in our community have increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7043.88)|
| 1:57:27| but the number of admissions have decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7047.12)|
| 1:57:30| And what came from that presentation is attributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7050.64)|
| 1:57:37| that decrease to investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7057.16)|
| 1:57:38| in community services and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7058.96)|
| 1:57:41| And that is encouraging for me to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7061.84)|
| 1:57:46| because that is also the data that was shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7066.76)|
| 1:57:52| at the last workshop and the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7072.04)|
| 1:57:53| that many of us are working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7073.92)|
| 1:57:57| working from that motivates us to propose our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7077.16)|
| 1:58:03| look into an alternative response program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7083.280000000001)|
| 1:58:07| that would be able to have an EMT respond to those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7087.360000000001)|
| 1:58:13| along with the behavioral health specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7093.320000000001)|
| 1:58:16| and be able to divert some of our calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7096.04)|
| 1:58:18| that are going to the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7098.52)|
| 1:58:20| I believe it's about 40% of those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7100.360000000001)|
| 1:58:24| going to the co-responder team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7104.360000000001)|
| 1:58:26| are ending up in an emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7106.360000000001)|
| 1:58:28| And so that's still a gap that needs to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7108.360000000001)|
| 1:58:33| in terms of stresses on our emergency system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7113.320000000001)|
| 1:58:37| and needs for other community services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7117.68)|
| 1:58:40| that can address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7120.56)|
| 1:58:44| So we have limited time tonight to give a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7124.080000000001)|
| 1:58:47| What I would encourage is that this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7127.08)|
| 1:58:50| and planning continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7130.8)|
| 1:58:54| One reason I would like to see that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7134.5199999999995)|
| 1:59:01| in a space where there can be a more collaborative discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7141.24)|
| 1:59:05| like a task force is so that we can actually identify items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7145.76)|
| 1:59:10| that are immediately actionable now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7150.84)|
| 1:59:13| that we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7153.32)|
| 1:59:15| I would hate for us to return to this space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7155.8)|
| 1:59:19| for another update without finding ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7159.08)|
| 1:59:22| that we can take action together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7162.2)|
| 1:59:24| So I'm continuing for us to consider the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7164.64)|
| 1:59:29| that an alternative response program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7169.16)|
| 1:59:31| could provide for our city and possibly our entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7171.84)|
| 1:59:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7177.84)|
| 1:59:39| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7179.360000000001)|
| 1:59:41| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7181.24)|
| 1:59:42| I just wanna echo my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7182.76)|
| 1:59:44| and Commissioner Buehler's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7184.68)|
| 1:59:47| This was a really good update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7187.4800000000005)|
| 1:59:49| on where we are in some of the investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7189.24)|
| 1:59:51| and while we've seen increased investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7191.4400000000005)|
| 1:59:54| we also cannot dismiss the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7194.08)|
| 1:59:57| that we're also seeing increases in our homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7197.4400000000005)|
| 2:00:01| to almost a crisis point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7201.16)|
| 2:00:02| as well as our mental health capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7202.96)|
| 2:00:07| of the people who are in our city and in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7207.88)|
| 2:00:10| One of the things that I'd written down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7210.6)|
| 2:00:12| before we got to the end of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7212.2)|
| 2:00:13| was expand capacity of services and beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7213.679999999999)|
| 2:00:18| And what I took away is that there are beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7218.44)|
| 2:00:21| that are out there, there are more beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7221.0)|
| 2:00:23| and they're unstaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7223.04)|
| 2:00:24| And so now it begs to ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7224.0)|
| 2:00:28| what can we do to incentivize people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7228.12)|
| 2:00:30| to go into the mental health field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7230.48)|
| 2:00:33| to be able to have those beds staffed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7233.32)|
| 2:00:35| Because absolutely, we cannot have people in beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7235.16)|
| 2:00:37| that are not staffed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7237.84)|
| 2:00:39| where they are getting the adequate treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7239.639999999999)|
| 2:00:41| rather than just housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7241.4800000000005)|
| 2:00:43| which is not safe for them or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7243.360000000001)|
| 2:00:46| Also again, when we hear the statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7246.040000000001)|
| 2:00:49| about people who are being housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7249.52)|
| 2:00:52| who are mentally ill and need those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7252.360000000001)|
| 2:00:54| and correctional facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7254.960000000001)|
| 2:00:57| and that's absolutely not the place for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7257.4400000000005)|
| 2:00:59| When we see the statistics of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7259.080000000001)|
| 2:01:01| who are being driven to a moccasin bin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7261.320000000001)|
| 2:01:04| and they get there and they're not certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7264.52)|
| 2:01:06| well, that's about an hour and 45 minute drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7266.000000000001)|
| 2:01:09| for someone to probably deescalate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7269.080000000001)|
| 2:01:11| But can you imagine how that person must feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7271.16)|
| 2:01:13| driving an hour and 45 minutes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7273.68)|
| 2:01:16| to probably a correctional facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7276.2)|
| 2:01:19| when they've not been admitted into the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7279.96)|
| 2:01:22| that we know that they need so desperately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7282.44)|
| 2:01:25| And so there's still a lot of work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7285.36)|
| 2:01:27| I appreciate what we've heard today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7287.76)|
| 2:01:30| but there's still so much more work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7290.2)|
| 2:01:32| And I applaud the efforts of everyone that showed up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7292.24)|
| 2:01:36| I really wish that our state colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7296.16)|
| 2:01:38| could have stayed for the entire session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7298.04)|
| 2:01:41| To hear some of these additional statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7301.24)|
| 2:01:43| and the comments, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7303.4)|
| 2:01:46| we need everyone at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7306.5199999999995)|
| 2:01:47| and everyone working together collaboratively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7307.88)|
| 2:01:50| and collectively as we look at our population growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7310.12)|
| 2:01:54| So is the state of homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7314.28)|
| 2:01:57| and mental health crisis in this city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7317.04)|
| 2:01:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7319.72)|
| 2:02:00| Mayor Roberto, I could answer the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7320.5599999999995)|
| 2:02:02| about incentivation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7322.5599999999995)|
| 2:02:05| I think that's a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7325.0)|
| 2:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7327.24)|
| 2:02:08| So the average nurse gets out of graduate school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7328.52)|
| 2:02:12| with $50,000 of grad school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7332.040000000001)|
| 2:02:15| The average social worker gets out of graduate school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7335.68)|
| 2:02:17| with $50,000 of graduate school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7337.92)|
| 2:02:21| And so the first piece of any incentivation program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7341.4400000000005)|
| 2:02:25| should be offering an off ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7345.84)|
| 2:02:29| for those healthcare professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7349.240000000001)|
| 2:02:32| to be able to get their degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7352.040000000001)|
| 2:02:33| and be able to then enter the field without the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7353.92)|
| 2:02:36| So I would try to use lottery reserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7356.64)|
| 2:02:40| because it's an educational program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7360.92)|
| 2:02:42| and that's what those things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7362.88)|
| 2:02:44| They're educational degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7364.400000000001)|
| 2:02:46| The second thing would be to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7366.160000000001)|
| 2:02:48| those people sign on bonuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7368.56)|
| 2:02:50| to be signed on to work in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7370.4800000000005)|
| 2:02:54| And I would tier the sign on bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7374.68)|
| 2:02:57| higher amounts for public sector work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7377.76)|
| 2:03:00| tie them to five years of commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7380.200000000001)|
| 2:03:02| to work in the public sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7382.320000000001)|
| 2:03:04| and then offer them a retention bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7384.08)|
| 2:03:06| out of a retention pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7386.360000000001)|
| 2:03:08| All of this is not a strange thing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7388.8)|
| 2:03:13| The commissioner of mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7393.52)|
| 2:03:15| has been very astute on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7395.280000000001)|
| 2:03:16| and proposed this sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7396.880000000001)|
| 2:03:18| for the past two years in her state budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7398.56)|
| 2:03:21| But we do need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7401.160000000001)|
| 2:03:23| But we also need to dial it up a little bit forward too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7403.160000000001)|
| 2:03:27| to get people to go to college and pursue those degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7407.040000000001)|
| 2:03:31| We have to be talking to young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7411.240000000001)|
| 2:03:34| where they are in middle school and high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7414.12)|
| 2:03:36| and career fairs, promote the professions as honorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7416.76)|
| 2:03:42| These kids are not dumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7422.2)|
| 2:03:43| They know their family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7423.96)|
| 2:03:46| are struggling with these conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7426.16)|
| 2:03:47| and that is usually the motivating factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7427.72)|
| 2:03:50| for most people who get in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7430.08)|
| 2:03:52| So if we promote it early and show them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7432.2)|
| 2:03:55| how to get their degree, get the degree paid for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7435.2)|
| 2:03:59| that sort of thing, that will incentivize people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7439.2)|
