| 0:02:26| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| Any opposed? So the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| For the Mayor's report, first I'd like to again relay my personal condolences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| as well as the thoughts and prayers of all of our city administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| and I'm sure city council as well, to the family and friends of Coach Pat Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| As many of her fans and admirers have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| it's impossible to overstate her importance as a pioneer, an innovator, and a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| More importantly, she's been an inspiration to everyone, but especially to girls and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| Pat Summit served as a life-changing role model to the 161 student-athletes who played for her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| and every one of them graduated. That's quite a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| But she also sparked the confidence and dreams of millions more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| Coach Summit was a great friend to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| and the city was honored to pay tribute to her life and legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| by changing the colors of the lights on both the Henley Bridge and on the pedestrian bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| crossing Henley Street at the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| Both bridges were illuminated in the orange, white, and blue that Coach Summit's Lady Vols made so famous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=215)|
| 0:03:43| It will be our honor to again turn the bridge lights to orange, white, and blue next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| leading up to the celebration of Coach Summit's life on July 14th at Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=228)|
| 0:03:58| I want to remind everyone who faithfully follows City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| whether here in the audience or by watching on CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| that tonight is our last meeting to start at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| Starting with the regularly scheduled meeting on Tuesday, July 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| Knoxville City Council meetings will begin at 6 p.m. rather than at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| And the monthly meetings of the Beer Board will begin at 5 rather than at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| So instead of 7, we'll be here at 6 o'clock starting two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| And Council members passed this to make it more convenient for constituents to attend our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| so we hope you'll all mark your calendars for 6 p.m. every other Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| I also want to invite anyone who loves to get out for a summertime walk in the wonderful heat that we've had to join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=280)|
| 0:04:50| Members of Council will be joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Deputy to the Mayor, Christy Branscom, at 6 p.m. on Monday evening, July 11th, for a new and maybe unusual event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=293)|
| 0:05:03| We're hosting a first-of-its-kind event called Neighborhoods to Nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| And the aim is to show how quick and convenient it is to get from just about any community to a park or a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=308)|
| 0:05:17| And plus, by participating in a planned group walk, you'll get to know your neighbors a little better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| while also nurturing that inner urban nature lover that's a part of all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| So the Monday evening walks, starting this coming Monday, will set out from different points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| So this Monday, we're setting out from Park Ridge Neighborhood, 4th and Gill, Old North, and Austin Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| and everyone will converge at the Ashley Nicole Dream Playground at Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| Walkers should meet up with their groups at 6 p.m. on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| I'll be walking from Park Ridge, and Mayor Brown will be walking, and I know Vice Mayor Grieve and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| and hopefully Vice Mayor Delvopi, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| I've gotten promoted to Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| I mean, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Sorry, Councilman Delvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Anyway, all council is invited, and I know they're checking their calendars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| and anyone who can join up with us, we invite them to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| We'll all be walking from the Park Ridge Community Garden at Olive Street and 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| Christy Branscum will lead the walk from 4th and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| They'll be starting at the 4th and Gill Park on Eleanor Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Vice Mayor Grieve will lead the walk from Old North, and that meet-up point for that walk is 4th United Presbyterian Church on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=399)|
| 0:06:48| And other council members, as they confirm where they want to walk from, they will be co-leading with all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| We'll all be leading these walks, so we'll be getting news out from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| So, council, some of you are just getting this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| I apologize, but with the holidays, there's been some communication issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| But anyway, as soon as we find out, if you can participate, we'll be sending out a press release about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| So there's also, earlier today, we heard from a group from Austin Homes that they want to join in as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| so we're excited to have them joining the walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| And so, by the end of this week, we'll have all the specific details for each of the walking routes finalized and posted online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash N2N, Neighborhoods to Nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| That'll be the logo, and the hashtag, actually, shall be hashtag N2N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=458)|
| 0:07:48| And anyone who wants updated details can also call 311 to find out the final arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| So we'll be doing more Neighborhoods to Nature walks in other parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and I encourage you and your families to come join us for this kickoff N2N walk beginning at 6 p.m. next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=478)|
| 0:08:07| So, council, I hope everyone will be able to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| So July 11th will be a busy day, and in addition to the Neighborhoods to Nature walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| it's also kickoff day for Tri-Transit Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Riding the bus is easy, it's inexpensive, and it helps reduce air emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| You don't have to worry about driving and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Instead, a rider can leisurely catch up on the news or e-mail on the way to work or listen to music or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| So the staff at Knoxville Area Transit is enthusiastic about introducing transit services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| to people who haven't yet taken advantage of those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| Tri-Transit Week is full of great events designed to illustrate the ease and versatility of transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| On Monday, July 11th, I'll be riding the CAT Route 42 bus with a group of city employees who are regular bus riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=530)|
| 0:08:59| Council, are you all invited to join us as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| We'll have lunch at the Sunspot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Remember, Cumberland Avenue is open for business, right, Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| And we'll return to the City-County Building on the Route 11 bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| So at 2 p.m. Thursday, July 14th, City Council members and I will be riding CAT again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| this time to cut the ribbon and officially dedicate the new East Superstop on Kirkwood Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| The East Superstop will make transferring on buses even easier for bus riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| So that's 2 p.m. July 14th at the Kirkwood Superstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| On Saturday, July 16th, neighborhood groups will be riding CAT buses to and from the Market Square Farmer's Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| And again, the experts at CAT are great about helping anyone plan out their individual route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| Using CAT to get to and from the Farmer's Market really illustrates how practical and easy everyday transit is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| There are many additional Tri-Transit Week events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| For more details, you can go to www.catbus.com or call CAT at 637-3000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=606)|
| 0:10:19| Or visit the City's main website at knoxviltn.gov and search for Tri-Transit Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| And before I get to my last thing, I just want to also recognize the great festivities yesterday for July 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=630)|
| 0:10:39| Those who were at the World's Fair Park, it was a fabulous day and great fireworks and wonderful music from the symphony orchestra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=639)|
| 0:10:48| And so I want to thank our special events, department, police, fire, emergency responders, all the volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=648)|
| 0:10:56| everybody who had visit Knoxville, everybody who had something to do with putting that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| I think it's a lot of great pictures were posted and I think people really had a great time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Finally, you may have seen or heard this on the news today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| These partners do a really tremendous job monitoring trends with local homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| with the aim of zeroing in on solutions and delivering resources more precisely and effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| Today, a comprehensive biennial study was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| And I know Councilman Saunders was there with me as I accepted the report from Dr. Roger Noe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| who is Director of Social Services at the Community Law Office of Mark Stevens Public Defender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| The Knoxville-Knox County Homeless Coalition and the Knoxville Homeless Management Information System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| which is the Knox HMIS, which is managed by the University of Tennessee Social Work Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| So I'd like to ask Michael Dunthorne to come up, who's our coordinator in the City's Office on Homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| and to very briefly summarize that report and see if Council has any questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| And you all have a copy of the executive summary at your place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=732)|

| 0:12:18| The report, the executive summary that you have there goes with this report, the full report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| and both are available online at www.knoxhmis.org and on the City's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=745)|
| 0:12:35| Just a few quick high points, I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| This is actually the 30th year, the third decade of these reports, starting with Roger Noe back in 1986,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=759)|
| 0:12:48| and they've been done every two years since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| And then more recently this report actually combines that also with an annual report from Knox HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=771)|
| 0:12:59| The study, Roger's study, was developed by interviewing 249 individuals who were experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=779)|
| 0:13:07| and it was done early in January, or at the end of January this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| And just a few items from that that are of note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| The median age of folks that we interviewed was 44, with men skewing slightly older than women, 46 and 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=798)|
| 0:13:29| Seventy-seven percent of the individuals reported emergency shelter as their most common sleeping location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| Thirty-one percent indicated that they also sleep in places that are unfit for human habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=815)|
| 0:13:44| Forty-eight percent, nearly half, reported employment issues and financial losses as contributing factors to their homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| A quarter of them, though, report having some kind of current employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| But the average weekly income for these individuals is just over $8,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| so that doesn't get you very far as far as getting housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| Wait, you said the weekly income, but the report says that's the annual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| Or annual income, I'm sorry, $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| That's a good pay, you know, for one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| No, no, no, $157 a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| Forty-seven percent of these individuals reported having chronic health problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Forty-six percent reported having hospitalization while they were homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| So it is a cost to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| Sixty-four percent reported treatment for mental health, and 15 percent reported that they were military veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=875)|
| 0:14:44| In addition to Roger's study, and there's a whole lot more detail, there's just no way I can get into everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| but there's a whole lot more detail in the report, and I would encourage you to download it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Or if you want to ask, if you ask me, I'll print you a copy and get you one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| In addition to that, the NOx HMIS annual report is the second half of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| And in HMIS, 9,339 individuals received services during the past calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=905)|
| 0:15:15| 7,714 of those individuals were actually homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| A little over 1,600 of them actually were housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| So people are receiving services to prevent homelessness and also to maintain home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| to continue being housed once they're placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| People ask me the question, you know, how many people are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| and that's always a complex thing because I just cited that large number to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| but by comparison, the point-in-time count number that we reported to HUD that was collected at the same time as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| is just a single-night snapshot of people either on the streets, in emergency shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| or transitional housing was 748 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| So you see that a lot of people go through this circumstance as you look at larger pieces of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=959)|
| 0:16:07| A few high points from the study here from the HMIS report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| 1,951 individuals were placed into positive housing, into permanent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| which is a slight increase over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| 3% of those folks were reported later to have come back to emergency shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| So people are being placed and most of them are staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Rapid rehousing programs, which are designed to help people who have just become homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| get back into housing quickly before things spin further out of control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| are reducing the time to housing significantly by 53% over the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| And likewise, emergency shelter and transitional housing programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| are reducing the time that people spend in those programs before they emerge to the other end of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| and get down the pipeline and into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| On the flip side of that, permanent supportive housing placements, people are staying longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| So we're seeing outcomes that are very important to the progress that we're pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| That said, there are still far too many people who experience homelessness in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| and I know you're well aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| At the root of it, there's not enough affordable housing available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| and we're working very hard on that, but that's a pressing need in this community and across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| Additionally, employment and income challenges plus mental health and physical health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| are major causes of homelessness, which, as you know, is a complex problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| and it includes not only individuals, but also families and children, young adults, and military veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| And we are committed to providing these resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| and I appreciate your all's support as we work to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| And we do have things that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| We do have things that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| The KEEM program for weatherizing, making more housing affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| We had a landlord summit to work with local housing owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| to try to make more affordable housing available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Case management at KCDC helps prevent people from losing their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| Permanent supportive housing like Menvilla, Flanagan, Helen Rossman NAB, and other places, it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| and we are making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| So I'd like to thank David Patterson and Lisa Higginbotham at Knox HMIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| and Roger Noe and the Homeless Coalition for pulling all this information together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| because it's having the right information in front of us that helps us understand the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| and do the right things to make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| All right. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Anybody have any questions or additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Councilman Della Voti?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Why is it 60% plus males?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| What do you attribute that to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Is it the veteran population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Is it men being kicked out of the house for watching too much football?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Why is it predominantly male?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| In my entire experience in working in this field, that's always been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| I think there's probably more openness to a lot of folks to helping women get back into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1160)|
| 0:19:33| or to prevent their homelessness and so it's going to skew that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| They're more vulnerable and there might be more services that reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Okay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| So thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| There's clearly a lot more to this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| and we encourage people to go to the website, the noxhmis.org workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| Also, if you go to the city of Knoxville website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| the Office on Homelessness will have a link to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| So we encourage you to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| At the press conference, many of the service providers were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| and really the progress that we're seeing is because there are so many good service organizations out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| that are working collaboratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| The Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness, we've got a plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| We're trying to track it where we can see where we're doing well, where we're falling behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| and certainly the HMIS and these reports help us with all of that tracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| We encourage you to go to the dashboard, the HMIS dashboard, which has a lot of this information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Thanks for the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Okay, now reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| Marshall, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| I just wanted to, today was the first day I heard about the Walks to Nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| and I think that's a fantastic program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| I think walkability is such an important thing to promote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| and actually I had been contacted by Caroline Cooley also to announce that July 12th is the Bike Walk Knoxville Ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| It's a bike ride this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| It's part of their summer tours that they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| and it's going to be at 6 o'clock at the Casual Pint in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| But they also have two other events, a walk August 9th starting at Jackie's Dream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| and then another ride September 20th starting at Trailhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| So that's the thing about walking, you're supposed to do it every day, right, or riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| So, anyway, I think it's a great initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| and I would encourage everybody to come out to the event on the 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| and then go up for a ride in Fountain City on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Councilman Della Voque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Just a brief announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Working with the business and professional associations that are in east and northeast Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| and there are four of them, and the neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| we're going to try to come up with an economic summit this fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| that will talk about both business needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| needs people see in terms of stores, health care, services that they would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| and to have sort of a roundtable-type discussion that will bring the various parties together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| whether they're business entities, developers, neighborhood groups, BPAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| I hope to work with the Chamber of Commerce, with Leadership Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| to get us some meeting handlers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| and to just kind of air it out and hopefully bring to bear more attention on what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| and ought to be an opportunity for the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| and certainly something looking forward to by the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| I will mention, and I know that David Massey has now put out his weekly newsletter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| and there is an address in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| but there is a Survey Monkey survey that you can take if you live in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| whether it's north Knoxville, east Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| and you can find that by looking at David Massey's newsletter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| by contacting our council office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| who will be happy to tell you the crazy URL for the Survey Monkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| If I read it here, no one would get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| But anyway, I hope you'll participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| I hope you'll provide that information as sort of a baseline we're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| as we go out and meet with neighborhoods and stuff over the next month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Councilman Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Yeah, I have two announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| We're going to go back to the hiking and camping and doing all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| Debbie Sharp and some other folks in south Knoxville have had South Trek for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1425)|
| 0:23:54| so I won't be hosting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| I don't want to step on their toes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| They do it once a month on maybe the second Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| I forget exactly when it is, but they go to various places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| So maybe I'll now sit along as they come available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| But I also want to talk about Knoxville Soup that's coming up this Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| July 7th at 6 o'clock at the South Knoxville Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| I'm just going to read off their website because it's easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| The door is open at 6 p.m. with proposals presented at 6.30 p.m. followed by dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| The dinner generally lasts for about an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| and folks get to share and connect with others while voting on the projects they like best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| There's four proposals in this session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| I won't go through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Then about 8.15 the votes will be tallied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| and the winning project will be awarded the donations that are collected at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| There's a $5 suggested fee to get in, and it's a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1489)|
| 0:24:58| It's well attended, and so, again, it's this Thursday at 6 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| if you want to come out for some fellowships and great proposals and learn about Knoxville Soup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| You can find out more about that on their website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| the southknoxvillealliance.org is who sponsors it, so it's this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| Okay, so now we'll move on to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| 8A is a resolution appointing Paul Armstrong to serve as the sixth district representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| to the City of Knoxville Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Mayor, I don't know if Mr. Armstrong is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| Is Paul Armstrong here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| I guess he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| I don't see him, but we appreciate his service on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| 10A is an ordinance to rezone property located on the west side of State Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| south side of West Summit Hill Drive, from C2D1 District to C2H1 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1557)|
| 0:26:05| City of Knoxville applicant on appeal from a decision of the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Okay, so we have, this is an appeals process, so I'll just explain the rules on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| Each side will have up to three speakers for a maximum of five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| The appellants will go first, followed by the respondents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| and then the appellants get one speaker for up to two minutes for a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| We ask that each person state their name and address when they come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| and I keep the time on that and will let you know as you get close to your time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| After we hear from both sides, then council deliberates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| and they are free to ask any questions before they make their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| So we will start on the appellant side, that is us actually, the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| We will have, our speakers will be Bill Lyons, Bob Booker, and then David Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| And on the respondent side, we have Jud Dance, Arthur Seymour, and John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| So if you all want to wave towards the microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| We'll start, and let me get my clock ready here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| and our law director will make sure that we stay on target for this administrative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1643)|
| 0:27:33| Okay, Bill, would you go ahead and start, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| As Mayor Rojero said, I'm going to be speaking on behalf of the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| which was actually filed by Mayor Rojero of MPC action on the Cal Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| While this discussion will inevitably get into other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| we must keep our eyes on the prize in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| and that is we're here to discuss whether the Cal Johnson building merits an H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| Does it merit historic protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| That's the question before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Is this building's history?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Is its significance to the community such that we place upon it an overlay to prevent any owner now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| and really more importantly in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| from seeking a demolition permit, which once applied for must ultimately be provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| I think everybody can recall not too long ago a demolition permit was taken out on the Prior Brown garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| and there was a lot of reaction to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| We heard a lot of folks saying, how can you let this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| How could you grant this demolition permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| And the answer to that was Prior Brown did not have any H-1 designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| and my answer to many people was you have to be vigilant that if a building is worthy of being protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| the H-1 needs to go on not when demolition is imminent, but prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| based on the merits of the building, its history, its architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| what other factors are important here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| The H-1 designation that we request is the use of a tool in your toolbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| especially provided under state law and by council action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| to identify those structures that are essential to keep for the community's fabric, its history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| and to the overall importance and message that it sends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| This tool is not meant to be punitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| It's not meant to reflect upon any owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| It is about the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| We have been somewhat cautious, some would say overly cautious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| in granting this overlay status to buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| I would argue that this community has held these structures to a high bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| I would argue that if any building meets the high bar of merit and protection, it's the Cal Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| We believe that it's very strong, and you'll hear more from Mr. Booker on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| The building, as you know, and you've been providing its history, was constructed in 1898,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| so we're going back to prior centuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| It's the only remaining building constructed by a former slave and a successful African-American businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| It remains just outside the area that we've been provided of recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| It was destroyed by the urban renewal process of the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| We've discussed this building with the owner for well over a decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| and trying to communicate the city's strong interest in getting the building developed and retained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| and we'll get into that a little more, but those discussions have always been pleasant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| but unfortunately the building stands today still in the shape that it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| What does an H-1 not do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Again, you're going to hear from Mr. Booker more eloquently about the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| and its overall significance to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| What it does not do is in any way hinder the building owner from developing the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| It does not place any additional burdens upon him or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Again, despite what you may have heard, we will hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| the designation does nothing to place a single hurdle in the path of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| In the past few years, without an H-1, the building improvements have been overseen under the downtown design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1856)|
| 0:31:06| We have kept that constant by taking explicit action to make sure that there was nothing different there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| The only thing different is that the board applying the guidelines will be the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| rather than the Downtown Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Some have argued that this will put this before a body, HZC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| that will be unreasonable in their application of the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| This is just fundamentally not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| The Historic Zoning Commission is well aware of, fully supportive of the process at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| At the meeting, I personally spoke to them about this when this came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| and they provided over the redevelopment of Market Square and other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| The city and surrounding owners have invested millions and millions in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| and we think the time is right for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Again, it's not just for now, but it's for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| It is about the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| It doesn't place additional burdens for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| and that's why we're strongly recommending that you consider and vote to grant the appeal for Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Okay, next is Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Mayor O'Hara and members of City Council, I'm Bob Booker, 2621 Parkview Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1936)|
| 0:32:26| In support of preserving the Cal Johnson Building, I want to put my statement in historical context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1946)|
| 0:32:35| For many years, there has been a concerted effort to preserve and renovate historic and important structures in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1955)|
| 0:32:45| Led by Knox Heritage and others, we have been fortunate to save and to learn to appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| a number of houses and buildings that represent our rich heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| Indeed, they help to define the character of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the black community erected many structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| that would be an integral part of those monuments of a progressive society, but they no longer exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| They would include a few of the 15 churches that were destroyed by urban renewal in the early 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| They include the Carnegie Library, erected in 1917, the Dr. Henry Morgan Green Medical Arts Building, erected in 1922,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2005)|
| 0:33:37| and the James H. Presnell Building, also erected in 1922, but they all fell under the force of the wrecking ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2017)|
| 0:33:47| The people who planned urban renewal projects and what would replace demolished structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| had no regard for the heritage of the black community, nor the negative impact it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2034)|
| 0:34:02| Consequently, only two of the scores of businesses that were uprooted still exist today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| Two of those business structures during that period were once owned and operated by Cal Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2050)|
| 0:34:18| One at the corner of Vine and Gay, his premier saloon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| The other at the corner of Vine and Central was a saloon with professional offices on the upper floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| Today, except for the buildings at Knoxville College, only three historic structures identified with the black community still exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2071)|

| 0:34:50| Another is Serene Manor on Ray Street that was built as the Negro Wing at Knoxville General Hospital in 1933.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2090)|
| 0:35:00| Most black people my age were born there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| This evening, our consideration is the third structure, the Cal Johnson Building on State Street that he erected in 1898.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2104)|
| 0:35:15| The lack of protection for and the ultimate destruction of the last remaining Cal Johnson Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2115)|
| 0:35:24| would be a tragic and cultural loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| As we gear up to celebrate our 225th anniversary in this city, we ought to value every entity that made us who we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2130)|
| 0:35:43| And thanks for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| Speaker is David Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2152)|
| 0:36:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| My name is David Dewhurst, 123 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| I wanted to come down tonight to, first of all, tell you that I certainly support the granting of historic protections on the Cal Johnson Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2170)|
| 0:36:20| but also to come down as someone who has gone through the process, both the downtown design guidelines process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| and the H-1 historic overlay process for development of a variety of historic buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| And I think there has been out there this perception that this is a very problematic, difficult, bureaucratic thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2194)|
| 0:36:43| And I can share with you that the difference, basically, of going through the D-1 process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2203)|
| 0:36:52| which is required of every single structure in our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| is a very, very similar process that takes up no further time than the H-1 process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2216)|
| 0:37:05| In addition, I might add that I have found it very beneficial in terms of supporting applications with our federal tax credit program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2225)|
| 0:37:18| and with dealing with our state historic preservation officer for having historic overlay protection applied from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2238)|
| 0:37:26| It's helpful and very supportive to your cause of getting the buildings that measure of distinction that can help with a number of development aids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2246)|
| 0:37:35| I find myself right now, over at the Kearns Bakery on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| very happy that that building that we recently had purchased has historic zoning applied to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| I've got a somewhat challenging conversation to go forward with our state preservation office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| And it is vital to how we go about doing the building to utilize the historic tax credit process to get projects like that accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2278)|
| 0:38:09| And mainly the point being that this process shouldn't be feared. It's not difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2289)|
| 0:38:19| And if preservation is the goal in mind, that this actually could be very much a welcome process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| And I think I'm very happy to see that in our city that we come to cherish and form a type of community that respects these types of buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2305)|
| 0:38:36| the history for all our community, and I would urge you for its passage. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| Thank you. We'll now go to the respondents, Mr. Dance, Mr. Seymour, and Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2323)|
| 0:38:51| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you. Jed Dance, 206 West Summit Hill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| I just want to kind of tell you a little bit about our situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| The Dance family has been in Knoxville for a long time. We started baking and company back in 1948.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2351)|
| 0:39:20| My grandfather and my father started it where we are today in one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| Through the years, we've acquired the other buildings and then what is now called the Cal Johnson Building in 1976.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2365)|
| 0:39:34| So that's been in our business since then. All our buildings are paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| Our business has been in downtown Knoxville back when it was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| When it was bad, when everybody left, we stayed there, paid our taxes and kept going, and now it's coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| So we're all about downtown. We're all about saving the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| And actually, I don't know how many of you all are familiar with it, but the city and the county actually tried to take our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| And so Cal would have been destroyed at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| We fought both of those successfully so that we could continue our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| And now with the Marble Alley Law Office, that's what the county took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| That's when they took that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| And now with the Marble Alley Law Office and the investment that the city's put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| we do have a valuable building now that we can address with tenants and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2428)|
| 0:40:36| I'll talk about that here in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And I agree totally with what Bill just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| The time is right because we've been there. He's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| We've met for eight or ten years, and we've always said, help us find a tenant, help us find a tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| We were down there on State Street when nothing was down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Downtown was just beginning to develop when we started these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Gay Street obviously was the first thing that began to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| And then in 2013, my father passed away, so our properties or the property was obviously tied up in the estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2462)|
| 0:41:14| We had filed all of our federal tax returns, and we finally, the IRS has accepted those as filed in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2474)|
| 0:41:25| So fast forward a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| From then forward, as we had worked with the city, I think Bill will agree we'd always done everything he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2489)|
| 0:41:37| I know Kim Tritt, David came down looking at the building back whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| Kim says, hey, I believe you've got a hole in the building, in the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| We shored that up right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| The city asked us if we would board up the windows for an appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| We did that for the look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| And then, of course, 2008 hit, things went down, and then, of course, my father passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| So I know there's a lot of rumors out there, a lot of talk, a lot of different statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| but I just want this on record that the Dance family never once said, we're going to fix it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| We said, please help find us a tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| We don't have the money just to spend, and I'll get into this a little bit about our business expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| We needed that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Well, today, after the estate was settled and we met with Bill and them in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| we have told, and I think I've told every one of you all, we are ready to fix it up, and we are planning to fix it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| Like Bill said, the time's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| You all spent a lot of money on the Marble Alley loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| State Street is now going to be two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| You all actually bought an easement from us out front to make State Street twice, or excuse me, two-way street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| So, you know, we've tried to be good citizens and always worked with the city when we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| One minute, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| So I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| We acquired Athletic House two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| Our business is expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| We're adding employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| And so we need this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| C for C in the future for expansion for Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| But we are committed to spending the money to fixing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| We're not asking for any government assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I know that's great for developers, and that really comes in handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| But we have set aside the money to fix this building with no help from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| We are committed, as soon as we can get this behind us, we will start tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| We have our architect here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| We've got the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| I think we're pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| I know they've got to go through a lot of legal stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| But we've showed it to Bill and Christy and the downtown review board because basically we're just going to fix it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| So we're prepared, with or without a tenant, to fix it up, spend the money, and go forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Some of you know the dances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Some of you not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| You know, you can say we might be a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| We might be a little conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| We might be a little not too bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| But one thing we aren't is, you know, we don't lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| And when we say something, we do follow through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| And so I just want that on the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| And with that being said, we've always run our business on a handshake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| We don't deal with a lot of lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| Unfortunately, we feel pretty strong about this, and we have a team of lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| and I know they charge them by the hour, so I'm going to get off here and let them speak quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| And I'll make sure I hold them to the five minutes, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| That'll help you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Thank you, Jed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| Mayor, members of council, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| I am here on behalf of the dance family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| That's Jed and his sister Beth there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Then the next generation of owners of the Bacon & Company are sitting right next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| This is an old Knoxville family business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| and it has prospered over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| They have prospered downtown, and they intend to continue to remain downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| I am not here in support of anything other than preserving the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| Who has preserved this building for the last 40 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| The dance family, not the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Mr. Booker and I have talked about our neighborhoods for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| His neighborhood was torn down by the federal government in partnership with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| Mine was, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| They both came down thanks to urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| The building has been preserved by the dance family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| and they intend to keep ownership of the building and preserve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| and are perfectly happy to do so under the downtown design guidelines of the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| which were adopted nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| The only talk of tearing down the building over the years has come from Knox County and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2765)|
| 0:46:13| and both were resisted by the dance family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| The historic overlay that is sought to be put on this building is not sought by the dance family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2778)|
| 0:46:28| There are a number of buildings in our community that are historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| There are a number of buildings in our community, the city of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| like the Cal Johnson Building, that have been owned by significant citizens of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| and that have comparable age to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| No one is trying to put historic overlays on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| The sole justification seems to be that the dance family will tear the building down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| and there is zero emphasis or evidence that they will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| Now, the building has not been redeveloped in the past 30 or 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| There are a lot of buildings in our community that have not been redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| The dance family was here in Knoxville when downtown was a prosperous place, a shopping place, an office place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2840)|
| 0:47:29| It remained downtown and invested in downtown when you could roll up the sidewalks at sundown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| because nobody was down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| It has remained here when it has seen the redevelopment of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| starting initially probably with the Sturkey Building and later with other buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| And that redevelopment continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| It has been done without a historic overlay in most instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| And downtown is not only redeveloping itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| There are a number of buildings yet to be redeveloped, but that is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| But you're seeing redevelopment out Central Avenue and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| It is the natural result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| The development of the Marble Alley Apartments, which, by the way, are a very fine development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2895)|
| 0:48:23| have spurred interest in State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| And the city is probably doing one of the great things for the redevelopment of the Cal Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| One, by supporting the Marble Alley apartment development and making State Street two-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2912)|
| 0:48:40| which makes the building the Cal Johnson Building much more accessible, much more visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2920)|
| 0:48:49| Something is going to happen there, and the Dance family intends to be part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| but they would like to proceed ahead and request to proceed ahead under the downtown design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| And I'm going to let Mr. King speak on the difference between that and the historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2942)|
| 0:49:11| But the architect, Brian Pierce, says the building has very good bones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| and it will be redeveloped as the market arrives there for a use for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2966)|
| 0:49:42| Thank you, Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| I'm John King, Post Office Box 2425, Marshall, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2984)|
| 0:49:54| I want to make a couple quick points before I talk a little bit about the rigs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| We talked about what's occurred in the last decade on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| If you recall, there was a real downturn in development, real estate, lending, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| starting in 2007, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| Development and anything that's going on anywhere went into that downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| Things sort of fell off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| That recovery started in about 2012 or 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| Now we have a situation where you have an owner who then dies, and they go through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| finish up at 2015, and then are faced with this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3037)|
| 0:50:46| His actions have been deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| His actions have been in the context of trying to get something done with that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| The plans have been drawn by the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| They have been submitted to the downtown design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| Unless something happens with regard to putting a historic overlay on this to complicate things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| we plan on going forward with those plans to do what we can to improve and rehab the Cal Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3073)|
| 0:51:24| I understand when people say that it won't really make any difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3084)|
| 0:51:34| but the guidelines that are going to be applied by the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| are the guidelines that are those of the Secretary of the Interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3099)|
| 0:51:47| If you read some of those standards, I think you will understand the degree of nervousness on the part of an owner or anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3107)|
| 0:51:56| They're sort of nebulous, if you will, illusory in content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| and leave a lot of open area for discussion and interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3121)|
| 0:52:12| Those standards apply to all treatments, whether it's preservation, rehab, restoration, or reconstruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3132)|
| 0:52:28| Those standards include things like the existing condition of historic features will be evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3148)|
| 0:52:43| to determine the appropriate level of intervention needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| Where the severity of deterioration requires repair or limited replacement of a distinctive feature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| the new material will match the old in composition, design, color, and texture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3174)|
| 0:53:02| On rehab, which is probably the more likely thing to be done here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3190)|
| 0:53:18| to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| that characterize a property will be avoided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| Each property is recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3220)|
| 0:53:49| Certain things will not be permitted to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| If you read all of these, it puts any owner in a position of not knowing really what can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3232)|
| 0:54:02| In reality, it likely involves a continuing discussion as to the features to be required or retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3242)|
| 0:54:14| If any change is involved, they will be dictating what the nature of that change is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3254)|
| 0:54:21| You've got somebody who has a history of preserving the building, who is ready, willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| and now able to go forward and do work on this building in anticipation of attracting a lessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3267)|
| 0:54:37| There's some sniffing around, if you will, on the part of potential lessees now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| Even if a lessee doesn't materialize, he's prepared to use the building himself for his own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| We would appreciate a vote in opposition to the request to place this historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| Up to a two-minute response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| I will have to correct the last statement and say we were very explicit in the request being framed in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3306)|
| 0:55:15| that the Historic Zoning Commission will apply the guidelines under the Downtown Design Review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3315)|
| 0:55:24| They will have very explicit guidance under this process, and I want to be very clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| We spoke to Historic Zoning, and they are more than willing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| to take the guidelines used by Downtown Review and to do the same thing that the Downtown Design Review Board would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| I might also add that I would have to push back that even on the occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3342)|
| 0:55:50| when the Historic Zoning Commission does not have such guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| all the buildings on Market Square have been done without any complaints to us in the redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| with plenty of leeway granted by Historic Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| But in this case, Downtown Design guidelines are those explicitly that they will use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| not what you would call, what could be referred to as the more ephemeral guidelines of the Secretary of the Interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| So that is the end of the formal speakers, and now it's up to Council for the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Certainly, as a representative of the 6th District, I wanted to express my support for the appeal of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3388)|
| 0:56:37| because of the historic nature of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| and I want to thank Mr. Booker for a very eloquent statement tonight concerning Cal Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3401)|
| 0:56:49| He was also, as in our packet, a former alterman, which I believe that's a forerunner of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| So, certainly, I will be supporting this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Councilman Dallavanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Obviously, I think everyone wants to see the building preserved, fixed up, put back into productive use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| and being a part of present society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| I didn't hear anyone say how that building was used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| The stories about Cal Johnson were that he opened several saloons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| He ran racetrack activities, including Speedway Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| It's still out there in Burlington, and I'm not sure what this was, some kind of mercantile building, a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3448)|
| 0:57:37| No one's mentioned some historic use that was special to that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3457)|
| 0:57:45| And so I come down to the proposition of why are we adding a burden to the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| if he is being sincere in saying that he is on the cusp of spending money and restoring the building to operative use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3472)|
| 0:58:01| I don't quite get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| I mean, if this building were threatened to deteriorate and fall down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| I think we should act with deliberate speed to prevent its loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| I mean, I don't understand what the urgency is at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| unless there is some concern about what is going to be done to the building or how it's going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| As I understand the historic guidelines, they basically want to preserve the visage of the building from the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| so that it looks like its historical self, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| I assume there's some ugly garage doors that probably need to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| But it's a brick downtown building with some frieze work up top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| and I just don't know what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| I am impressed with Mr. Dewhurst saying that it didn't add any burden in his mind to what he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| Of course, he was looking for tax credits, and it actually gave him a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| But I haven't heard anyone tell us what we hope to accomplish by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| by adding a layer of government or oversight to a building that's being used and protected by the family that owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3541)|
| 0:59:10| So that's my trouble point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| I wish someone would answer that for me because I don't understand how it was used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| I don't understand whether any changes will affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Let's give it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| First is how was it used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| Do you want to speak to that, Mr. Booker, to start with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| Was it one of the several saloons, or was it something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Cal Johnson was an entrepreneur who dabbled in all kinds of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| But this particular structure was built by him to be rented for other enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| He'd never used it himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| It was a clothing store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| It was an automobile store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| There were 10 or 12 different businesses in there between 1898 when it was built and the time they stopped using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3592)|
| 1:00:00| I did have a list of all those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| But it was retail, mercantile-type use, rental space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| But the thing is there are very few things of a historic nature owned by black people in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| and that has been my discussion all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| We've got to think about black entrepreneurship and what it has meant historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| but we seem to have forgotten that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| And all of our businesses have been destroyed by the wrecking ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| and that's why I'm so passionate about this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| I appreciate the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| So the other question was about why put an undue burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| And I think what either the law director or Dr. Lyons could correct me if I state this wrongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| but the only extra burden is that in the future if anyone wanted to demolish the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| it would have to go to the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| That's the only additional burden because the agreement is that they use the downtown design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| which he will have to use anyway even without the H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| Because it's in the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Because it's in the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| So the only burden arises if he or a future owner wants to demolish it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| and then they have to go through a process to determine if, in fact, they can or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| That's the only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| That's the 180-day moratorium where people can look into that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Actually, it would already have an H1 on it, so it would immediately go to that review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| That would be part of the review process by the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| It's protective of not destruction, you're saying, not destruction of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| The only additional burden, because we have agreed to downtown design guidelines to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| rather than the historic H1, the historic guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| then the only additional burden is that it would have to go through a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| if the current owners or future owners wanted to demolish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| And so that's why, in my opinion, it's the best of both worlds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| because the community gets the knowledge that long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| that that building cannot be demolished at the whim of a property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| whoever it is, whoever it might be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| And they get the advantage, the current owners get the advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| of renovating it, restoring it to the downtown design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| which they have to do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| So there's really no additional burden unless they intend to demolish it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| That's the beauty of this compromise, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Dr. Lyons was talking about you don't apply what they were calling generalized guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| The stuff that Mr. King was talking about did not relate to this particular H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| I picked up that from Dr. Lyons' rebuttal, so that was helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| So Mr. King, would you care to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| I had another question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| If the Historic Zoning Commission has adopted and says it will review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| according to the standards adopted by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1996,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| and those are the review guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| and it says they shall be made a part of the recommendation that's sent or forwarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| I'm not fully understanding how you just don't apply them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| and apply a different set of guidelines as suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| So I'm not really expecting that issue to come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| but I think I'm not really comfortable with the idea that they can just pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| and choose which set of standards they're going to be using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3840)|
| 1:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| I'm going to ask Gerald Green, Director of NPC, to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| I'll start with the answer, thank you, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| I may ask Kate Grable, our Historic Preservation Planner, to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| With locally designated historic structures or districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| the local jurisdiction can apply various standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| as long as they are compatible with the Secretary of Interior's standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| It's not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| In fact, in Forth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| they have a certain set of design guidelines appropriate for that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| and Old North, Knoxville, they have design guidelines appropriate for that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| and Fort Sanders, they have design guidelines appropriate for that historic neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| The guidelines are tailored to be adaptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| and subject to the unique architectural and historic character of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| or district for which they apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Ms. Grable may want to add more, but that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| I was going to just say that at the NPC meeting when we got into this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| the attorney for NPC agreed that, in pretty much what Mr. Green had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| that it was up to Council, which we have put in this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| to give instruction that downtown review guidelines would be those that would be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| So basically a subset of the larger set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| Okay. Does that answer your question, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3932)|
| 1:05:48| I'm not finding what I need right quick, but the application for the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| I'm not finding what I need right quick, but the application for the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| attached the purported guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| to be utilized on this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| to be utilized on this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| I'm trying to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=3975)|
| 1:06:46| Go to Finbar and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4006)|
| 1:06:59| Mr. King, while you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| What is attached is labeled Secretary of Interior Standard for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4020)|
| 1:07:08| and it pretty well describes some of the things I was reading to you earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| and that is the purported guidelines to be applied in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| and it's labeled Secretary of Interior Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| and it's verbatim some of the same language I was reading to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| I would suggest to you that if you adopt it as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| the guidelines that are there are guidelines which come from the Secretary of Interior's guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| and that's what's going to be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| With the report prepared by the MPC staff that was presented to MPC when this was first considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| the comments of the staff were, and this goes with the rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| would follow that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| The design guidelines proposed to be adopted with this rezoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| request of those of the downtown Knoxville design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Yeah, I'm in agreement with Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I support this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| You know, for a long time, and I have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| I used to work for Jed Dance's grandmother years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| and I knew Jed Dance very well and respected him a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| They have been a mainstay in this community and a wonderful family and a wonderful family to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| and I'm delighted to know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| I was on the Historic Zoning Commission for 23 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| and I watched the Historic Zoning Commission work hand in hand with developers in rehabbing older buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4129)|
| 1:08:57| Vice Mayor Grieve and I served together for many years on that commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| and I watched Vice Mayor Grieve help folks rehabbing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| It was fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| And so while they are guidelines, and that's exactly what they are, guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| I found them to be flexible and favored good development, good, sustainable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4153)|
| 1:09:22| In regards to this specific building, in 2004, I visited the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| and Jed and his sister and Jack Dance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| in an effort with Bill Ions and Kim Trent from Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| Knox Heritage, as we are all aware, has had this on their watch list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| or Fragile 15, if you will, for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| I think far in excess of the 12 years that I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| So this has been a building that has had huge community interest for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| It's not something that's come up just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| And I think, given all that I know and my experience with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| to put this overlay on this building will, in fact, enhance not only its value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| but the workability that the owners will have with the city, with the state if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| and if you choose to have historic credits or not, that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| That's not something we are trying to push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| But I think to make sure this building is preserved in perpetuity is well worth our doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4228)|
| 1:10:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| Well, I think for the reasons that have been cited, this building definitely does have merits for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| The burden falls on the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| The burden falls on the Dance family, who I've known for a number of years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| They've owned it, and they have the benefit of the historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| and just being able to get the tax credits and the significance to a TIF if that was ever the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| And that's what he's not applying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| He's applying for it to he's going to develop it himself and rehab it himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| And given that they've owned it for 40 years, they have a business downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| they bought it under the principle that anyone should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| if an adjacent property comes available to them, they ought to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| And that's what they did, and that's what they've owned it, and they've maintained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| I think that given the history of the timing of the real estate recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| the timing of his dad's death, and to get out of that and come out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| I think he should be given an opportunity to develop it himself without that burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| It's only a benefit if you want the tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| He doesn't want the tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| He's not looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| It's only a benefit to those to enhance its value if that is your intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| is to sell it or to use that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| So it's not a benefit to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| And if it's not a benefit, I think it becomes a burden to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| as he tries to rehab the building for his own private use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| I'm just not in support when you have a willing and able property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| who stood before us with a long history of Knoxville saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| I will develop this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| I have my plans before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| Give me an opportunity to do it without a fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| And I think to get it to this matter, it seems it's a bit heavy-handed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| and I'd like to give him the opportunity to develop it without it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| and let him stand to his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| As Finbar said, we've served on the Historic Zoning Commission for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| and I really don't see this as a burden in terms of what needs to be done to this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| In fact, if anything, with the buildings that I've been involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| and I know David Dewhurst has been involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| this is probably one of the more simple buildings to deal with in terms of the historic zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| I had a long conversation with Kay in terms of what has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| and her work with the family in terms of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| And I really think that what we have to look beyond is that this is the history of our black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4401)|
| 1:13:30| And as Mr. Booker said, it's one of the few buildings left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| And what we're asking for is just to make sure, whether it's this family or any family in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| that this building not be easily demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| And what we're really looking at when you look at the renovation of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| it's really not that difficult compared to a number of buildings that we've been involved with in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| And it's obvious that the family has already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| I mean, they've made a commitment, and I've gotten to know Jeb a little better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| and they've made a commitment that they're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| And I really have a struggle with why there's a concern over whether it has an H1 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| The H1 is really for their protection and really the protection of this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| and the historical facts of what this building was all about for in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| And so really when you look at the plans and you see that basically what they're doing is they're replacing windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| and they're going to point up the brick and that sort of thing, it's really a pretty simple project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| So having a historic overlay on it is really not a detriment in this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| So I'm certainly in support of an H1 on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| And I think there's probably some other buildings that we as council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| and we as the city ought to be looking at in the future also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| So thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Unlike several of my colleagues, I've never met the Dance family until a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| when Jeb called to talk about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| And as we have considered other properties that have come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| who we perhaps did not know the families as well as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| we have not been as inclined maybe to give some leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| I'm convinced that the Dance family is very well intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| and they will do what they say they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| But we also know that sometimes things happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| and a family can't carry out what their intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| And I think it is essential to preserve and keep this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| as part of the history of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| I worked with historic preservation in San Diego years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| and I know what happens when you think something will happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| but if you don't have the protections in place, they frequently don't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| So I will be supporting the overlay, not because I doubt the Dance family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| but because I think it protects them and it protects the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| I just need to say I need to abstain on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| because I work for the same firm as John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| I think I may be the only council member that lives in an H1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| So anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4576)|

| 1:16:49| It passes six to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4609)|

| 1:16:58| So in two weeks we will be back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4618)|

| 1:19:32| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| I wanted to ask community development in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| There is a couple of things I want to ask about commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| in Burlington and also the Crestview Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4782)|

| 1:19:48| Could you talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4788)|

| 1:20:02| after receiving a number of proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| These funds were in last year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=4805)|

| 1:27:05| Are you fine if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| This is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| We will be back in two weeks for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| I'm sorry, counsel, if anybody had intended to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| I looked for lights, and I forgot that I had people to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| I didn't get there quick enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| It blew right past me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| I was, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| I'm going to go back and speak to it, because that's all right with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| Let's just, when we check with our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| You want to reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| It was a unanimous vote, so you can have a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Or you can hold it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| I'm just making a motion we reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| I just want to speak to it, and then at least have discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| It's my fault for not saying we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| Normally I would say we have two speakers, but I looked and saw there were no lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| And thought y'all didn't want to talk about it, and I forgot we had speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| It's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| I went right over my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| Speak, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| I'll second his motion if he wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| To reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| If he wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| So we have a motion and a second to reconsider 12A for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Because he wants to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| Okay, discussion on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| Yeah, I mean, I can appreciate the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| This is not the final reading of this issue, and I would like to, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| You know, being the sponsor, the prime sponsor, I mean, I would like for just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| I mean, we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| It's a proper motion and a second, but again, it's not the final say-so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| But I have plenty of opportunity on second reading to discuss it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| I won't be supporting the measure of reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| Let's hear George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| I guess I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Are you intending to change your vote, or is it just for discussion purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| Yeah, I will change my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| You are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| I will, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| We'll hear it in two weeks, but I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| I just got right past me, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| My fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Well, I guess I feel obligated to let him change his vote on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5342)|
| 1:29:10| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| I was just going to say, I'm sort of like George as it just flew by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| I was kind of surprised, but I'm willing to wait the two weeks and talk about it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| I'm going to take a simple majority vote for a motion to reconsider at the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| A simple majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| Do you want to speak to the motion again, Councilman Wallace, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| Sure, I'll speak to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| To reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| To reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Well, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| I mean, yeah, to speak to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| I think it's got past me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| I mean, if we don't want to, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| We'll talk in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| But I think it's a worthy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| You had a workshop about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| There's a lot to be said about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| Okay, so let's vote on the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Okay, we need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| Okay, the motion to reconsider passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| So this is brought up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| Do we need another motion, second to have the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Second to have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| So now we need a motion to approve 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Okay, now we have two people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| Would you like to hear from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| If you wish to speak, you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| But if you wish to speak, you have up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| And, again, I apologize for blanking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| Ms. Carruthers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| It was a nice surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| Name and address for the record, please, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| Terry Carruthers, 6102 Arcadia Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| I am a founding member of the Colonial Village Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| I also serve on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| I served six years on the South Knoxville Neighborhood and Business Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| And while the Neighborhood Association has not had the opportunity to have a formal vote on how we would consider this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5483)|
| 1:31:33| I can say that there has been a lot of anecdotal discussion over the years at both the board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| and at both the general meetings that we would be in favor of supporting this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| And the same goes for the six years that I was on the South Knoxville Neighborhood and Business Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| We also had a lot of anecdotal discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| And, of course, that's an umbrella organization that represents the majority of the neighborhoods in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5515)|
| 1:32:04| One thing I think that needs to be considered is that other cities, both nationwide and here in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| have passed restrictions on these, and they have done so successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| You know, you've mentioned Chattanooga, Memphis, Smyrna, Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5536)|
| 1:32:24| And I think it's just sort of like a scare tactic when you feel like there might be a lawsuit in regard to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5544)|
| 1:32:34| because other cities in the state of Tennessee have been very successful with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5554)|
| 1:32:40| We're not saying, no, you cannot locate here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| We're saying, well, we have these certain restrictions you can't locate in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| but you may be able to locate somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| And I think, you know, it needs to be looked at in that respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| and that we don't need to be scared to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| Thank you, Ms. Crothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| Now, Jim Brady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| And I apologize for going too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| My name is Jim Brady, 208 Linford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| I want to thank Mr. Green and the MPC for a really nice presentation and all the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| Mr. Swanson, I'd like to thank him because it was so great to see the levity of this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| and the cautiousness that we have to take with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| And Councilman Toplas, you know, he truly carries our conscience in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| and that's not just a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| And that's really an important factor for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| There's a recurring theme as we went through this project last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| and it kept coming up over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| Everyone who spoke about this made references to other sorts of establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| adult bookstores, adult video stores, which was a lively discussion about what the difference was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| liquor sales, alcohol sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| There's a recurring theme that keeps happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| Many years ago, we used to come into different cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| and you'd see where pagers were sold in different grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| When you started seeing more than two or three or four of these stores selling these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| you started realizing you were in a part of town you didn't necessarily want to break down in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| So when we start allowing these businesses to cluster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| we're reaching out to the least common denominator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| I think it would be interesting to ask Chief Rush if he sees a reduction in crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| in areas where these things go unencumbered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| and I would say that we probably would find a negative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| Inaction in this situation is not the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| We have to have some form of action with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| Again, just like my neighbor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| we're not intending for people to be prohibited from having a business or an establishment like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| What we're trying to do is prevent a clustering of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| I don't know if we would have a different discussion about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| if we saw eight of these pop up in the corner between Beard and Beer Garden and Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| or if we saw one on the corners of Cedar Bluff and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| or in the Cal Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| These are the considerations we have to have as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| because this is what establishes what we are as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| When people travel, we are the corridor from the Smoky Mountain National Park into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| We are the last thing they see before they come across the bridge and see our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| And when they leave our city, that's the last thing they see when they go out of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| I really do think that this is in a situation where inaction is not the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5749)|
| 1:35:57| The state of Tennessee is looking at this, the federal government is looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| and I just think that we need to have some consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| and we need to be ahead of the curve on this one and not wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Okay, now discussion, and I'll go to Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| And thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| And I apologize for missing the workshop last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| We've been talking about this for quite a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| and I think this is an issue that's not just South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5791)|
| 1:36:38| This is not a South Knoxville issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| It's a city issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| It's across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| It's spread out all across the city as payday lenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| I understand that these businesses, they do cluster for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| So do other businesses, mattress businesses, drug stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| I mean, they tend to cluster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| Sea stores, bars, I mean, there's a reason why they cluster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| I agree that payday lenders, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| put their businesses and locate their businesses next to people that can afford it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| and the people that can at least afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| And that's what they're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| I understand the predatory nature of their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| but they are a viable business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| and they are a business that is regulated somewhat by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| Should it be regulated more and the federal government more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| But that's not what we're here about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| Will 1,000 feet difference, will that make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| and will that eliminate clustering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| And I would venture to say no, it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| I would say that many of these buildings that have been renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| those property owners are grateful for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| They're grateful for the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| They're grateful for the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| They're grateful for the redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| And some of them have been done quite nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| A number of the ones I've seen, the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| I've driven all four corridors of this city and looked at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| Many of them are in very nice buildings in very nice locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| They are on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| They are at the corner of Cedar Bluff and Middlebrook and Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| and up and down all the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| They're everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| And it's expensive real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| So they're viable businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| Do I agree with their predatory nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| But I don't agree with other businesses that I don't frequent either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| But I think when you look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| and you look at can this make a difference, I'd say no, it can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| And when you have your law director standing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| selling you that you don't think you have good ground to defend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| you're putting the city at risk in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| And I know firsthand of the property that the video business on paper mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| I was very familiar with that back in the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| and that did put the city in a great distress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| And I think that's what we're setting ourselves up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| There's probably other businesses that are probably even more damaging to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| that we're going to put the guidelines on them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| Where does it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| So I think it's very, when you have council that's leading you one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| and you're trying to go another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| I just think you've got to be cautionary about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| and the ramifications on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| I'm sure other cities may have done it, but that doesn't mean it makes it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| And I don't think it's going to benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| You don't hear the payday lenders coming here and arguing why we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| There's probably a reason for that, because it's not going to impact your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| And I think you're impacting property owners as tenants and, I mean, as landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5985)|
| 1:39:53| I just think it sends the wrong message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| I've never been in a payday lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| I've never invested in a payday lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| But at the same time, I think it's a bad message to say you've got to spread these businesses out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| because we don't like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| So I'm going to vote no and tended to vote no the first time, and I appreciate the reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6009)|
| 1:40:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| I was not present at the workshop, but I did watch it on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| I saw Mr. Swanson make his eloquent appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| I heard others make eloquent appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| And then I watched the tape a couple of times, painfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| I say we have to get you more to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| Oh, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| You need to get a Redbox movie or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| Very quiet life, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| I am not comfortable with the whole concept of payday lending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| because I think it preys on the vulnerable in our society who do need money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| but that's not necessarily the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| Banks have, over the years, written off a segment of our population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| and refused to make loans available to a segment of the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| that these alternative financial services have jumped to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| I don't want the city to be sued either, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| However, almost every time on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| we have some kind of ordinance that carries that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| And if we sit around and wait for Chattanooga or Memphis or Nashville to be sued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6085)|
| 1:41:32| that's not a very good service to the people who live in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| Councilman Campin and I represent the area with the greatest cluster of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| and that's at the corner of Merchants Road and Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| I know the folks on Chapman Highway think that they're over-served with these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| but believe me, you need to come out to Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| and then when you get through there, cut over to Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| and there's plenty to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| I really think that the 1,000 feet may not be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| It may be too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| I would hope down the road that we will have some restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| I think some of these will go out of business because, as with anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| competition makes you thrive or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| But I would not have a good conscience about voting against limiting the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6139)|
| 1:42:27| between new alternative services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| It would bother me very much to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| I was here, but I didn't watch the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| When I was here, you know, when this first came up before the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| and many months ago before we sent it to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| it was pretty clear that the clustering of these kinds of businesses is a form of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6169)|
| 1:42:56| You ride through an area with that stuff and you say bad things are happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| and maybe that's not true, but that's the perception that this is a run-down area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| and you can call it a ghetto, but that has racial connotations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| It's a run-down area, and it discourages other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| and other people who want to invest in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| Now, there is a big misperception because I've gotten dozens of e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| and I'm sure you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| We can't take away the ones that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| They're grandfathered under state law, and we have zero power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| But we can prevent further clustering by having some distant requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| I think that's a healthy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| Let me add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| Part of my misfortune in life was to have been a lawyer for about 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| and I now read the case of City of Knoxville v. Entertainment Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| and it's the case that involves that fantasy video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| and the sexually explicit material that this council was trying to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| The problem the court found with that whole ordinance was simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| that the statute didn't give clear notice in a due process sense of what was prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| They had fuzzy words like it has to be a substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| and significant part of its stock and trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| I mean, how many naughty videos do you have to have before you violate the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| We are not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| We are talking about a clear, on-its-face rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| stay 1,000 feet away from the guys that are already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| and I don't think anything in that case indicates that we cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| Now, maybe there's a perfect case up somewhere that will look at it as it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| but this case says the City of Knoxville failed to give notice to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| that run these businesses of exactly what was prohibited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| and they struck it down for vagueness, not overreach of the zoning power, but vagueness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| and that was the ruling that it was a constitutional violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| That aside, let's assume that someone can sue you because anybody can sue you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| That's what lawyers do, and that's what people do when they're angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| I think Ms. Palmer is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| We have a moral obligation, and Mr. Pavlis, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| a moral obligation to this community to try to avoid further blight, further damage to communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| If they're viable businesses, they can go 1,000 feet down the road and open their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| and I think that that's at least a prudent first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| We have to leave to the federal government and to the state government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| to regulate what happens inside the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| We are not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| We're saying spread them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Don't let them cluster, and I think we should vote in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| I'd just like to respond to the issue about the fantasy video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| Apparently I was inarticulate in the way that I referred to the fantasy video case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| because I never intended at any time to say that this ordinance is similar to the fantasy video ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6359)|
| 1:46:06| I never intended to say that this ordinance is in any way vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| I don't think it is in any way vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| It would not be found to be invalid for vagueness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| The question that I have is the law is not settled as whether this is a power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| that has been delegated by the state to Tennessee to regulate a business in this context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6381)|
| 1:46:28| and that was what I was trying to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| and I only referred to the fantasy video case in terms of if you have an ordinance that is vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| in this case not for vagueness but because we didn't have sufficient authority to adopt it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| then you have to look at what the potential measure of damages is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| to determine whether you're willing to take that calculated risk or not to go ahead and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| You were saying it was a risk situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| I was saying that the exposure to the city of large damages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| if someone should prevail in a case that this ordinance would be void for any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6421)|
| 1:47:10| not probably for vagueness because it is not in fact vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| but for lack of sufficient specific authority to adopt that ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| then the measure of damages could end up in really big numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| That's what I was saying about the fantasy video case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| and apparently I did not articulate that well enough either for you or the new Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| to convey what I intended to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| I appreciate your clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| You ever have those times where there's so many thoughts running through your head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| that you don't even know where to begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| But I'm going to tell you where I'm going to begin, and I'm going to begin in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| because I've served eight years as an at-large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| and I've served seven of eight years shepherding a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| and it's two totally different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| Every district has yelled and screamed and said no more of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| and I have to bring this forward as representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| It affects the whole city, but I represent South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| and I want to take you back to the bridge closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| Think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| So we forget about that now that the bridge is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| In the terrible time that our businesses went through during that closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6502)|
| 1:48:31| small independent business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| So let's fast-forward it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Urban wilderness, all the good things that are going on in the district and in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| this is a black eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| This is a step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| So let's not forget where we came from in this situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| That's why I'm so passionate about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| because I haven't forgotten what our businesses suffered through during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| It's unique in South Knoxville and different from West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| because there's not as much available real estate in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| going down Kingston Pike or other areas, even though it's a citywide issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| But you're going through the very heart, the business district of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| and you've got 12 to 13 to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| I don't know how many there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| There's too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| I can tell you that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| So because of that concentration, when you go through South Knoxville, it's really relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6569)|
| 1:49:36| It stands out that you're going through all these areas of what I consider black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6576)|
| 1:49:43| Yeah, CVS and all these people, they do cluster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| But guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| Those type businesses don't take their property values down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| It's proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| It's been proven in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| We've got the best MPC in the state, but I'm going to give some credence to Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| and they did a study and showed that it did decrease property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| That's the last thing we need in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| After all the fight and all the investment that we all approved here, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| I always thank the members of council for what they've done for my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| and for the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| So to me, if we don't do this, and we're not limiting, and I'm being repetitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| but I'm going to keep saying what's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| and it's right that we're not prohibiting them from doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| We're just saying please don't cluster, and let's spread it out some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| You've still got all the ability in the world to be cruel and unusually harsh to people who can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6641)|
| 1:50:49| But, well, I mean, call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| It's a tough business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| Call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| I won't call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| It's a vicious cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| You know, we're the last of the big four cities to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| This council has been very diligent in the way that we've gone about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| We've probably, in my mind, I wish it hadn't taken as long as it's taken to get it to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| but I'm glad that we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| So, you know, what's being proposed in Knoxville, and I was very careful with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| because we do have very conscientious people that serve on this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| and I knew it would be a hard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| But this ordinance, and, you know, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6689)|
| 1:51:34| is a lot less restrictive than the other ones that have been proposed and approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6694)|
| 1:51:41| So it comes down to a policy issue, and Mr. Swanson was very forward with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6701)|
| 1:51:48| and he said, you know, at the end of the day, this is councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| It's a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| And as Councilwoman Palmer said, you know, when we do rezonings or appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6713)|
| 1:51:59| just as we did tonight, denial of beer board applicants and what have you, we're subject to a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6719)|
| 1:52:07| Granted, probably not as much, and I didn't realize this until Mr. Swanson brought it to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| This type of a lawsuit could have more dire consequences than one of those instances that I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6732)|
| 1:52:22| But let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| If we don't do something, we're taking investment to disinvestment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| I always remember Bob Wetzel saying the absolute opposite of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| So we've invested this money, and every day that we allow this to continue on, we continue to lose money every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6753)|
| 1:52:41| Instead of just one big lump lawsuit, if we don't do, you know, I'm willing to take the step, the plunge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6761)|
| 1:52:49| Obviously I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| But every day that goes by, not only in South Knoxville, but every part of the community that these things affect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6771)|
| 1:52:59| the property values go down, businesses don't want to locate there, the businesses win their leases up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| I promise you we'll move out of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| You'll have more vacant buildings, and that's the last thing that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| We need to move this thing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| Councilman Steger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| Certainly the most entertaining discussion we've had after a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| Anyway, there's really, I guess, not too much suspense here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| But I think I really appreciate Councilman Pavlis bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| I think it is a problem, and it is all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| I was just looking on Google Maps where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| There's two in the Kroger Shopping Center there at the Kroger on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| and then just three within a stone's throw of Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| So, I mean, that's a significant clump there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| and I know the community all around there really wants to redevelop that area and make it more of an asset to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6833)|
| 1:54:00| So I think it's a good step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| Let's hope it makes a difference, and I look forward to voting on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6843)|
| 1:54:10| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| I mean, I want to just point out that as you continue north on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| there's another 17 to 20 between the Kroger and Fountain City Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| So it's a high concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| I think limiting the distance is very prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Well, I counted the little dots on one of those maps to see how the clustering numbered out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| And in the third district, there were 19 of these places clustered right together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| And in the fifth district, there were 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| So you've been at Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| And Mark and I share some of these because we have common boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| In the second district, which people think probably doesn't have any of these, there are 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6889)|
| 1:54:56| But significantly, they're almost all clustered in areas where there are apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6896)|
| 1:55:05| or less affluent type housing than one might find in Sequoia Hills or Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6905)|
| 1:55:12| And in the first district, I counted 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| I know it just were clustered in one little area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| That doesn't mean there aren't more, but it's just in one little pack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| And in the sixth district, there were 11 that were very close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| So when you look at this, this is not all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| but the fact that you've got these clustered and the blight that they bring to an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| because they do send that image, that when you cross the bridge to and from South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| the first thing you see when you go up Clinton Highway, that's the first thing you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6942)|
| 1:55:48| Broadway, others, Kingston Pike, others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| So I really do think that we need this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| and I'm, like Councilman Pavlis, willing to take the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| I'll make sure before I call for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| George, you want to withdraw your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| Thank you, Councilman Walz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| Vice Mayor Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| This has been a really hard one for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| because philosophically I have a problem with controlling businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| and saying what can go where and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| I'm not sure how we came up with 500 feet versus 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| I drove out Chapman Highway today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| and one of the first things I saw was the new Bojangles being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| and then the donut shop on up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| And then I went further out and I saw a couple of the play places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| that had fixed their buildings up pretty nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| So it's really a struggle for me in terms of driving around the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| and realizing that these businesses are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| but at the same time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| we're going to possibly grandfather in 68 of them that are already here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| and what's that going to do to the competition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I'm just like the rest of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| I abhor the idea of what these folks do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| and I'm certainly hoping that the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| and the federal government come down and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| But, again, philosophically, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| where do you draw the line when you start deciding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| what businesses can go where in our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| I do understand that a number of the buildings that these people are in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| of course they're now being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| but I think that some of these buildings are pretty well run down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| and are not maintained very well anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| But, again, my big thing is that I'm going to have to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| in the next couple of weeks is philosophically how I feel about whether or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| you know, this council ought to be regulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| whether certain businesses ought to go in certain locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| and that's why we have zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| I mean, zoning allows us to do certain businesses in certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| and to all of a sudden now begin to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| well, if you're a pay establishment or a pawn shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| then, yeah, you can go in this zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| but you've got to be 1,000 feet away from somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| or 500 feet away from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| So I'll be doing a lot of thinking about this in the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| but I do appreciate what my colleagues had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| and I think all of you brought up some good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| But, again, I just want you to know that philosophically I have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| But you won't give them a roof sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| No signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| No signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| Well, I would just invite Councilman Grieve to go a little further out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| because, I mean, obviously you didn't go through the heart of what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| I did go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| I'm just saying that those were the two that I just raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| Obviously you didn't see what I see every day that I drive down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7123)|
| 1:58:49| And, again, you know, philosophically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| I can't imagine you'd be for businesses that deteriorate property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| that devalue property tax and other people's investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| and it's proven that's what these businesses do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| So I hope you'll consider that as you deliberate the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| Okay, but we do have to vote again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Explain the vote because we're not sure what we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| Okay, you are voting on 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| The motion is to pass 12A, which would impose the restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7161)|
| 1:59:29| So we will do it by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Yes, with reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Okay, the motion passes 8-1, and there will be second reading in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Okay, now we are on 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| 12C is an ordinance to close a portion of McCormick Street from the northwest corner of parcel 109BD003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7206)|
| 2:00:13| to the southeast corner of parcel 095OH016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owner's Stan L. Wollack Applicant First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7217)|
| 2:00:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| I would like to ask if the gentleman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| Mr. Wollack was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| Yeah, he's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| But did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| I would just like to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| You want to ask him a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| I'm curious as to what I've heard varying reports as to what your plan is, so I'd just like to hear it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7253)|
| 2:01:00| Please state your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| I'm Jeffrey Wollack, 1106 Pettigrew Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| That's South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| And we have the property there at 1106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| It's adjacent to McCormick Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| The property is on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| I just want to put a garage in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| It's not actually a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| It's a paper street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| It's never been a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| It's never been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| It's right there at the beauty shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| It's not the same one then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Oh, that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| That's the one coming up to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| Okay, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| You've got one coming up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| That's another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160705?start=7308)|
