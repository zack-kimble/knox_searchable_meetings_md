| 0:00:30| We have seven council members here. We're going to go ahead and begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| Take their seat, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=36)|
| 0:00:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| I'm going to ask Councilman Marshall Stair to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=56)|
| 0:01:03| Please stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=72)|
| 0:01:21| Thank you. Now I'll ask Ms. Hopper to call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| Councilman Campin. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Councilwoman McKenzie. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| Councilwoman Ryder. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| Councilman Roberto. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| Vice Mayor Saunders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| Councilwoman Singh-Perez. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| Councilman Stair. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Councilwoman Welch. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| This is going to be an opportunity this evening to kind of dig down and get into the weeds a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| and find out much more of the detail and make some comments on the part of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| There certainly will be a public forum at the end of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| but I would like to ask my colleagues on council if they have any opening remarks that they might want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Sure. Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Well, I just want to say that it's the expectation from this body that we get this report from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=130)|
| 0:02:20| recommendations by the end of the year, and then we have 120 days to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=140)|
| 0:02:28| And I hope that we will, that this council will have our own public workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| I would say two. I would hope for two public workshops prior to voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| And we'll take our time within that time limit to work through these details and work it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=160)|
| 0:02:48| that we're not under a compulsion to vote on this by the end of the year, as some people have suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| I kind of want to make that really clear. I've heard a lot of comments about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| I further hope that we will call a special meeting just to vote on recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| The sign ordinance vote that night went way long, and we started that after an hour and a half regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=185)|
| 0:03:13| So I hope that this council will consider that we will maybe have a special call meeting for a special purpose of voting on recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| and that way our time will be well spent. It won't be way late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| And I hope that one thing that was stated early on with this is that this recode would be zone neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=207)|
| 0:03:35| that it would be however the equivalent of the new zone that would be equivalent to what the existing zone is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=215)|
| 0:03:43| This is not an opportunity to up zone or down zone properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| This is simply a reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| So those are probably the three big things that I've gotten the most comments about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| and the most phone calls about even as late as an hour ago about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Thank you, Councilman Wallace. Councilman Stier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Thank you. I agree with everything Mr. Wallace said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| I think there's really nothing sacred about December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| I think it's good that the consultant is on schedule that they provided us originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| But in terms of passing it, I think it's certainly something we need to take the time to get right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| and getting it right is much, much, much more important than doing it early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| So I think I would agree that we need to take the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| Even with the sign ordinance, it went back and forth to MPC a couple times, which even extends that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| So I think the public, coming out tonight, I hope the public knows that we're committed to getting it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=282)|
| 0:04:50| and there's certainly no rush to do it in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| Thank you. Are there any other remarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Yeah, I'm really glad that you used the term, Mr. Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| getting to the weeds this evening, because if my notes are any indication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| I think we may get into the weeds a little bit, but I think that's a necessary point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| and I think in the process of getting it right, I think that's something that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| But one thing I'd ask those at home and those here with us today to think about too with this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| although a lot of this is going to be very street by street and what's occurring in a certain parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=328)|
| 0:05:36| there's also an element of the fact that this hasn't been really looked at in 60 years in a comprehensive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=336)|
| 0:05:44| And so if we can step back from that and envision what we want Knoxville to look like in 20, 40, 60 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=344)|
| 0:05:54| I think this is really an unparalleled opportunity to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| And so it is difficult to do when you're looking at things at these minute details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| that we're going to be looking at this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| But if we can try to picture that, and especially when we're hearing from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| I'd love to hear from folks about what that vision looks like for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you, Councilman Roberto. Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| I do want to remind everybody, my colleagues as well as the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| and the audience that may be viewing us tonight, that this draft, this second draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| and the third one to come will reflect the input that has been received from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| and from many members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| The schedule that was set up was actually set up in consultation with everybody here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| everybody that's had input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| So this has been a known schedule for two years now, almost two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| And we do need to keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| I agree with every comment that has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| December is not the critical moment, but we need to get on it and look at it, have some workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=418)|
| 0:07:06| And I would certainly be amenable to doing a separate Council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| if we can work that out with our attorney and figure out how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| I think that's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| But anyhow, those are the opening remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| I will now turn it over to Gerald Green and the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| And Gerald, I'll ask you to introduce our consultant again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Well, first, thank you for this opportunity for a workshop to go over the recode Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| the updated city of Knoxville zoning code, and let you know where we are and ask you some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| And I'd like to introduce Arista Stringes with Cameros, who has been the consultant working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| Her cohort, Chris Jeanette, came to Knoxville but had to leave this morning because his mother is ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| and he had to get to Vermont to be with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| And Arista is not the only partner we've had in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| We've had the city staff with Peter Ahrens taking the lead in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| And, you know, Peter and I have gotten to know each other very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| probably at some times too well, but we've also learned how to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| and to ensure that this code reflects what we think is the direction that the city needs to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| based on some guiding policies that council has adopted, the comments we've heard from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| There are other partners, too, the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| and Amy Minus from the Neighborhood Advisory Council, also a member of the Stakeholder Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| has been great in helping us organize neighborhood meetings in all sectors of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| Amy Nolan with the Chamber of Commerce, also a member of the Stakeholder Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| has played a great role in helping us get involvement from the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| and is working with the Chamber and other Chamber members to hold meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| and get the word out and coalesce and comments from the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| Jennifer Roach from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| and also on the Stakeholder Advisory Committee has helped us organize meetings with realtors and developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| and gathered their comments and served as a great liaison between that business sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| the business community, and our staff and the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| John Sanders, who's with the American Institute of Architects, East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| East Tennessee section, also a member of the Stakeholder Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| has served as a liaison between the architecture community and staff and the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| and collecting comments from the architectural profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| and letting us know how they feel with regard to the updated zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| Other partners include the Knoxville Area Urban League, SEED, and Centro Hispano| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| that we've worked with to reach out to the underrepresented sectors of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| So we're not doing this alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| We have some great partners doing this and have had great input from the community that I'll get into later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| This is, again, an opportunity for us to update you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| and for you to provide us with some direction on some key issues that have been identified to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| We're now in the process of collecting all those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| We had a great number of comments that came in today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| and even though we've undergone some not-so-positive feedback about having a deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| a deadline is great to get comments in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| And I'll repeat what I've said in some meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| The reason for the deadline was to enable us to get comments and have them reflected in the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| We're not cutting off comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Any comment that we get, we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| We may not be able to reflect that comment and address it in the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| It may be a separate document that has comments received after deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| and those comments listed in our recommendations that would be incorporated in the next draft of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| but may not be reflected in the draft number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| We want comments to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| We're not cutting them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| We just needed a deadline so that the consultants could get them incorporated in the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| So comments at any time are welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| With that, I'll just state that we're now in the process of assigning new districts to the 73,000 parcels in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=674)|
| 0:11:23| We've done that for the first draft of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| We're reassessing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| We knew that we were, in some cases, testing the waters with some of those district assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| And I'll say even with Tim Coon, who's our GIS specialist and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| they had a number of questions and sometimes we, when I say we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| Amy Brooks, who's our planning services manager and I, who are the main contacts at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| didn't know exactly how to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| So we need the comments and the direction from the community and from the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| Start the slideshow and just a brief overview of what we are going to do this morning or this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| It's been a long week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| We want to touch base with the guiding principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| What led us to develop the code and where those guiding principles came from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| What we've done with regard to community outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| Again, the key issues we've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| Just a brief overview of the draft zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| and then talk about our assessment of the schedule and the next steps for what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| And our guiding principles, the big one is to support investment in the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| Some parts of the city need some guidelines and requirements that provide stability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| need it to attract investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| Our former industrial sites, think of standard knitting mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| We need to provide a type of standards and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| that will enable the creative redevelopment of those sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Our older commercial centers, we've gotten questions about a lecture to a class at UT earlier this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| and they asked me what happened to Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| We know that the retail market has changed dramatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| and how do we encourage and incentivize the redevelopment of sites like that through new codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| We want to protect things that are uniquely Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| and that means that we have to encourage investment in the city's corridors and neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| while protecting the characteristics that make those neighborhoods unique and those corridors unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| Our resources, history, and icons that are uniquely Knoxville must be protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| and must be honored as we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| We want to connect our community and provide connections from our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| which has experienced a great resurgence over the past 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| and continue that along our corridors and make sure the corridors are connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| to those neighborhoods that are adjacent to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| and that redevelopment enhances not only the corridors but the neighborhoods adjacent to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=850)|
| 0:14:20| and also connect to our great resources, our rivers, parks, and green spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| and provide opportunities for all of us to enjoy those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| And we want the code to be easy to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| If you notice in the draft, there are more graphics, there are tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| A great step forward is our use matrix, which is in Section 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| where you can look at all the uses that are permitted in a zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| or find the zoning districts that permit the use that you desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| We have had a lot of community outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| Vice Mayor Saunders said the contract for this project was signed almost two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=897)|
| 0:15:05| in December 2016, after RFPs were solicited and the proposals were reviewed in June of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| So we've been doing a lot of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| So far we've had, if you look in the box on the right side of the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| three rounds of public outreach of people who came to the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| On the technical report, number 756.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| On draft one of the ordinance, 685.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| On draft two in the map ones, we've had 420.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| So far the comments we've had via e-mail are three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| well not counting today and some portion of yesterday when we got a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| map comments are 355 and the general comments on the ordinance are 348.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| So far we've had over 8,000 points of contact on three codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| I know given the population of about 180,000, that seems small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| but given the usual public involvement in what they consider the strange government undertakings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=959)|
| 0:16:08| that's quite a number and I think Knoxville should be proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| The citizens as a whole should be proud of their involvement in something that's detailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| technical, and not easy to digest, and I think that speaks highly of those citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| Now we're going to get into some of the key issues and topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| and this may surprise you based on what you've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| but accessory dwelling units are one of the top points of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| There's been a lot of question about our R2 multifamily zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| some neighborhood preservation issues, questions about the high and long corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| We've received a lot of comments about sidewalks and the need for sidewalks in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| nonconformities and infill housing standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| and I don't think I have something special on sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| but just a quick comment that sidewalks are not addressed in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| That's not the appropriate place to address sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| The city I know has been working some time on a policy walkability ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| and that is the appropriate place to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| MPC drafted an initial walkability ordinance for the city and handed it off about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| and the city has been working on that, so that's the appropriate place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| but I just want you to know that we have received a number of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| addressing the need for sidewalks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| We have tried through some of our standards to increase what we call the pedestrian feel of new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| by putting some standards in that bring buildings closer to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| that provide for some basic design guidelines or standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| that would enhance the pedestrian feel along our corridors and streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| And this, I'm going to first acknowledge Jennifer Roach again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| because CARP did some research on it, the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| I think I went one too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| I jumped over one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| With regard to accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| maybe I will stay on there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| My computer is trying to move me faster, so I must reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| But the homes sold since 2016, 30 of those had an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| Of that 37 of them were in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| The homes sold with an ADU are larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| They're almost twice the size of those without an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| They are on larger lots, and they are older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| Other cities that have adopted new or amended ADU ordinances run the gamut from local ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1121)|
| 0:18:50| or ones in Tennessee, Nashville, and Chattanooga, to Vancouver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| leading the way with accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| If you have questions at any time, feel free to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| I'm not going to say you have to wait until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| If questions come up, please ask them if you want direction or guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| In mapping our zoning districts, we did try to do what Councilmember Wallace said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| remain zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| And we did very well if it were residential before it's residential now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| if it were commercial before it's commercial now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| We had some challenges with our C-6 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| because C-6 allows some commercial uses and some light industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| and we don't have that zoning district in our new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| so we had to decide whether some of those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| based on what information we could gather regarding their use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| would be better zoned industrial or commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| And we received some comments that we missed it on a couple of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| but overall we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| We wanted to encourage the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| and protect the existing character of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| and this is where we, quite frankly, had a challenge that leads to the R2 question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| We have a lot of areas that are zoned R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| which is a multifamily zoning that allows almost 30 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| It's in Oakwood-Lincoln Park, which we have a resolution from Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| directing us to apply a single-family zoning to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| It's in parts of South Knoxville, where the residents have told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| they like the new R2 end zoning, which is single-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| because it protects the small single-family homes that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| and assures that there won't be inappropriate multifamily zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| It's in East Knoxville, where some of the neighbors at a Burlington meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| said they appreciated the single-family designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| And we're torn there because we know it does limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| and we've heard from the community, that we limit multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| But the question that I have for you and that we have to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| is where does multifamily belong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Does it belong on a narrow street that transit can't travel down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| where every existing home is a single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| or does it belong along the corridors and near the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| where the residents can have access to transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| they can have access to other services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| and it does not intrude on the established single-family character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| of neighborhoods that people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Affordable housing is not only multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| It can also be a small single-family home on a smaller lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and we have to provide for a range of housing types for all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| And I think it's not fair to say that affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| must be multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| We must provide the opportunity for people to live in all types of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| throughout the community and have access to the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| and the infrastructure must be there to serve the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| and the density of development that's occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| That's just a little lead-in to the next thing, which is our comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| And I'm not going to go over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| I want you to know that this is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| We have it on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| This presentation will be on our website, and you can access this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| But this is a district comparison chart that shows the comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| between our existing residential zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| and our proposed residential zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| and shows how they match up, or in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| how there are some new districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| The RN-3 district is a new district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| and there's no existing zone that compares to the RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| The RN-4 is new, and there's no comparison for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| So we have a new RN-7, which is a pure multifamily zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| where there's no comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| We use this chart as a guiding principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| in mapping those residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| We've heard some questions that you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| The most interesting comment we have is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| we've increased the lot size to 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| and my neighbor who has an acre and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| can now divide their property into six lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| And I said, yes, but before they could divide it into eight lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Well, you did something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| because they can divide that property into six lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| So sometimes it's impossible to win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| but we're trying to do the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| And this shows that the lot distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| size distribution in the R1 neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| those to the right are more than twice the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| of the underlying minimum lot size requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| So those lots could be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| But keep in mind that those lots also have to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| minimum lot width requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| that there may be someone who likes a larger lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| and wants to maintain that larger lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| In all these cases, the lot size currently is 7,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| so we're actually minimizing the opportunity for subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| But that right exists now, and it will exist in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| Director Green, I'm going to pause there if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| because you said we could interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Yes, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| So, yeah, on this minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| the difference between Draft 1 and Draft 2 in R and 1 is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| We're still at 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| There's a change in Draft 2 from Draft 1 in the minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| in R and 2 is reduced to 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| This may help answer your question for some of the reasons we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| We have a number of lots that are below 7,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| and so we made the choice to say let's drop it to 5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| and we significantly reduced the number of nonconforming lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| that we were going to create by reducing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| We do have some R and 2 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| a higher percentage that are more than twice the minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| and could be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| We are going back and finally tuning our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| to see if some of those areas that are over 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| in minimum lot size, if there's enough of a cluster of those larger lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| so that that area could be zoned R and 1 as opposed to R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Well, that kind of got to what my question was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| in reviewing what the change was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| and then asking if this change was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| to help reduce the risk of nonconforming lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Yes, and I think it's later in my presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| but I'll spill the beans now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| In the R and 2, I'm trying to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| I may look to Tim to tell me the percentage of nonconforming lots in R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| 1.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| 1.8% of the lots are nonconforming in R and 2 now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| as a result of reducing that lot size to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| That means that they had no challenges with setbacks with lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| when they tried to get a loan to buy or purchase a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| We don't have to tell the lender that the lot is nonconforming in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| Again, I think that's a key issue to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| that we've reduced the number of nonconforming lots in the R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| to 1.8% of the total lots in that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| So let me make sure I've got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| What are we looking at with the percentage of nonconforming lots presently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Overall, about 20% of our lots are nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| And that would be either too large or too small?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| And that's based on the current 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| So by making this change, you've reduced it to less than 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| You mentioned this just a minute ago, and so I've heard this concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| so I want to make sure we talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| When you're discussing taking a larger lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| and you're going to divide it into smaller lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| what is the process that someone would go through to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| Their first step would be to meet with either MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| or plans review and administration staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| to see if their lot could be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Does it have the minimum lot width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| In order to be subdivided, each lot has to have a width of 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| so your existing lot would have to be 100 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| and then each lot to be created would have to have 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| So if it could be subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| then you would receive a yes from the staff person you talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| You would then have a surveyor plant the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| make sure if there are existing structures on the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| that they meet the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| so you could not have a home in the center of the lot and subdivide it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| because that would not meet the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| and you'd have to have that 50-foot minimum lot width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| for each of the proposed lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| So you'd have to address all those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Then you'd have a surveyor prepare a plant, bring that plant to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| It would be an administrative review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| so staff would review it and make sure it met all the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| technical requirements and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| in the subdivision regulations of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| approve it, have the owner or the surveyor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| would then pick up the approved plant and record it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| So this would be an administrative review, no public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| No public, and currently that's the process that's in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| The only time it becomes a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| is if there were new roads, a new infrastructure being requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| or, for example, if the home is to one side of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| but not far enough to meet the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| and the applicant requested a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| or the owner requested a variance to reduce the setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| then that becomes a public hearing and public notification is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| Okay, so there's no public hearing currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| but there wouldn't be a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| in the draft of the recode we're looking at either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| No, no, there would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| And that's a separate ordinance, the subdivision ordinance guides that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Well, I just want to make sure I was clear on that, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Any other comments at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Yes, Mr. Green, I've got a couple questions and some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Right now, I mean, we're planning this ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| for two or three generations at least, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| And I think most of the panic that I've heard from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| on subdividing lots and lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| has been from people who have large lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| and want to keep that and have the fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| that it's going to be divided tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| and then suddenly 17 houses are going to pop up in their front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| And what I want to talk about is that this is for generations to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| This isn't that we're going to move ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| and suddenly there will be changes necessarily even in my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| And it's a slow process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| And I've made it clear that I have an illegal, unused ADU in my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| so I'm trying to be transparent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| But also I have a lot that's almost an acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| And I'm not going right now under the existing zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| I could divide it into at least three lots under the proposed two or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| but I have no intention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| And I'm fairly typical of folks in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| We have larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Well, some of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Some have very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| It's a very mixed lot size neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| which makes it hard for Tim and his staff to apply the zoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| because we have a mixture of lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| But I don't think anybody in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| is going to go out and subdivide their property tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| and create new lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| because we tend to like the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| And one person in my neighborhood really enjoys those large lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| because he's a teenager and started a lawnmower business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| and knows all his neighbor's lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| I think it is a slow process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| and it's something that if it does happen, it will happen over a long length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| And keep in mind, I've stated that the lots have to meet minimum lots size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| minimum lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| If there are any structures on them, they have to meet the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| It becomes a very complicated process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| and if there's a 10,000-square-foot lot with a home in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| even though the new minimum lot size is 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| they likely will not be able to subdivide it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| without demolishing their existing home and then creating two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| I think we're a ways from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| And then there's different statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| about how many people are going to be moving into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| in the next 20, 30, 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| But if we even cut the number, the highest number I've heard is 170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| That was for the county. That was a misstatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| That was a projection for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| To include the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| To include the city, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| What is the number on the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| And it's not broken down to city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| All the projections are countywide, and they vary from a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| I would ask people to go to the Baker Center website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| and they have the most recent population projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| for all counties in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| And I hope none of my county commission bosses here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| because I work for everyone, because I'm going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| I think it would be, in terms of economic advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| it would be better for a lot of those people to move into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| because the infrastructure is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| And from an economic and infrastructure standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| I think we should do everything we could to encourage new residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| to Knox County to move to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| because I think it's more economical for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| What I'm getting to is that I think we need an easier process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| to be able to divide lots in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| because I think infill is one thing that we're going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| We're not just going to be moving people into the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| So that's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Okay. And we're trying to make it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| A lot of it is governed by state statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| We did get a state-enabling legislation in the last session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| that enables staff to review and approve final plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| instead of having them go to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| which saves time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| So we're trying to, but, again, a lot of it is guided by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| Okay. Thank you. Ms. Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Gerald, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| I just want to make sure to reiterate, I think, a point that I understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| that you made, that under the current zoning ordinance, lots can be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| So this is not a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| And, actually, if it is a change, it's potentially a reduction in the number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| Yes, in the RN-1 districts, all those RN-1 districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| previously were some form of R1 with a smaller lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| Got it. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| And this is a, I mentioned this comment earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| but this is one we heard a lot, bring back the orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| And the existing R2 is mapped primarily in those communities close to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| And I've seen this as a planner in other cities in the 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| trying to be frank but not too frank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| that all those close-in neighborhoods were zoned multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| because that was the place that those people in multifamily should live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| and the suburb was zoned single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| So this is not the appropriate zoning template that we want to continue in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| especially when we have neighborhoods like Oakwood and Lincoln Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| that have requested a single-family zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Our plans, some of our corridor and sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| call for protecting single-family character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| and the infrastructure does not, would not accommodate multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| at the scale that even the existing R2 permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| We are trying to address multifamily in several different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| Duplexes are permitted as a special use in the R1 and in the R2 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| We have the RN3, which is for attached units, and we've mapped that throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| We have a revised RN4, which calls for small-scale multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| up to 20 units of multifamily that can be developed as attached units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| as townhomes, as pocket neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| Now, one to eight would be a use approved by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| There could not be more than four units in a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| so you could do a fourplex, or two fourplexes, two rows of four-unit townhome clusters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2126)|
| 0:35:35| a pocket neighborhood with staff approval up to eight units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| The minimum lot size for the apartments is 2,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| so you could do eight units, and this may scare some of our R1N neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| but on 16,000 square feet you could do eight units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| which is 16,000 is less than about a third of an acre, just over a third of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| so you could do 16 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| You could do a pocket neighborhood, again, with staff, with staff-neighbor approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| We're trying to identify places to strategically map that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| and we also want to use it as a tool that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| when someone wants to develop small-scale multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| that we have a tool that they could use to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| and so in some cases they'll be waiting for zoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| We also have plans that call for us to intensify use along our corridors and at nodes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| and I'll pick Kingston Pike as a corridor or nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Close-in nodes along Kingston Pike would be Western Plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Humber Place, and there at North Shore in Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| So we want to provide for intense development there with mixture of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| and multifamily along transit corridors where residents can take advantage of the transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| and maybe reduce their living costs even more by using transit instead of owning an automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| We have, and I've used the analogy that we have that as a city policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| and want to encourage that development along our nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Well, I've used the analogy of if you want to fill up a balloon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| you don't blow all over the place, you blow into the balloon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| So if we want our corridors to have more intense development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| because the infrastructure there can sustain that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| we've got to concentrate our efforts along those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| We can't spread it out all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Given that we do have the RN-4 and some RN-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| and we have places zoned RN-5, RN-6, and RN-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| so we do on our zoning map have multifamily areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| We have not taken a brush and just brushed any place that's close to downtown as R-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| I think that's, quite frankly, I think that's a type of discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| that we're telling people who live in those single-family neighborhoods close to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| that they're only suitable, that's an area for multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| and not for preservation of smaller homes, single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| We've got to be more strategic in our approach, and we're trying to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| and we look for input from the community to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Where are those strategic locations for application of RN-4 or even the RN-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| which is a very intense multifamily district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| We've also, again, we've mapped the existing multifamily uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| All the existing multifamily uses is multifamily zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| to ensure that they remain compliant with the zoning classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| Yeah, Gerald, I think the point there, and some of that bring back to Orange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| is just making sure that what's zoned currently R-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| remains what your new terminology would be RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| So, I mean, I think some of the orange left because the map changed it from R-2 to R-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| and then some of the orange left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| And I think when you go back, if you go back and keep it zoned neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| and you put those that are R-2 into RN-5 and return that to its equivalent use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| then some of that orange will come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| And I think we will try doing that, and we'll also use the RN-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| which will be the smaller scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| But we also want to acknowledge that the infrastructure needs to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| to serve the multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| RN-5 allows up to 50 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| and is that appropriate on some of those places currently zoned R-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| where we could have a significant multifamily complex that can't be served by transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| because the bus can't negotiate the streets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| But I think the point was that this was going to be neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| So, I mean, now is not the time to say, well, this parcel really should be R-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| when it's zoned R-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| And I'll leave that to city council because as a planner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| who has to look at the long-term cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| I can't say that R-2 is appropriate or RN-5 is appropriate on some of those streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| that are currently R-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| Again, I'll leave that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| I'll make my recommendation based on my professional opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| and let you make the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| Well, then it won't be zoned neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| So then we kind of misstated what we were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| I mean, we told people up front it was going to be zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| That's what I mean by when I say zoned neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Our zoned neutral was if it's residential, it will remain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| If it's commercial, it will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| We've got some conflicting policies, zoned neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| but we also have to protect the existing character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Do we protect the existing character of Brookhaven because it's R-2 now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| by zoning it 50 units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| So we're trying to weigh those different guiding principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| and the direction that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Does R-2 allow you to have 50 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| It allows 30 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| So what equivalent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| No, actually R-2, if it has a sector designation of high-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| would allow up to, I believe, 80 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| We've got to, again, I think a more strategic approach benefits the community in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| And we are, when we receive comments from property owners who are currently R-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| and our first draft made them R-N-1 or R-N-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| we are working with them to assign an R-N-4 or a multifamily classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| Are you waiting to hear from those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| In some cases, again, we'll go back and look at the maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| and find areas that can accommodate a multifamily development and zone those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2489)|
| 0:41:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| You used a term there, Director Green, high-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| which is in the draft, in the second draft that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| But there's two other terms that are no longer in the draft, low-density and medium-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| You and I have talked about that, and I've talked with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| So I'll ask you, I'll do something that's maybe not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| Answer a question with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| And it's not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| So my question, though, is then if we're going to say low-density is not defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| so we're not going to use that term, medium-density is not defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| so we're not going to use that term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| why do we have high-density as a term that's still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| Because that is contrary to what we just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| Is high-density defined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| I'm going to roll my chicken out here and turn that one over to our consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| So, I mean, it is to Gerald's point, and as you kind of look at ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| they start to move away from these classifications of low-density, medium-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| just because what is that breakpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| And if you define that breakpoint with numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| what happens if you switch up the numbers within your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Say you tweak something, and all of a sudden a district you said was low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| changes into medium-density by 500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| even though that's not the perceived character of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| Say by 500 square feet is what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| So the intent was to move away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| It may sound contradictory, but the idea of saying high-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| is something that people still envision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| It is oriented towards multifamily-type development, so you kind of see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| The medium and the low, you're looking at areas that are probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| both of them are single-family and two-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| and you're just kind of looking at the lot sizes to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| so you can't really get a good breakpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| But when you say high-density development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| people generally believe you are referring to a taller building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| or a significant amount of apartment units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| and that's why we still use high-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| So it's not, there's no real clear answer on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| and the idea may be if it is really irksome to still have that term in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| we can find different language to describe what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| with high-density to maintain consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| but I would rather go towards eliminating those terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| rather than trying to define them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| and getting yourself into kind of an unintentional pickle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| on what is low, what is medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| I can totally see your point about if you overly define these terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| then you may inadvertently limit yourself in something you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| but the point that you were making about folks can envision what high-density is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| I mean, I think you can also envision what low-density is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| and maybe what medium-density is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| I guess the question I have or the concern I have with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| is by just removing those two terms and leaving high-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| are we saying something inadvertently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| that maybe this council's not trying to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| that everything's high-density or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| So maybe there is some other terminology that we need to look at there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| and I certainly don't want to speak for everybody up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| but that did give me some concern to see some words taken out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| but others that were in the same category left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| And we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| We can describe what we're all thinking of as high-density in different terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| so that way it becomes more consistent for all the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| if that's the direction you would like us to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| Anything else before I move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| One thing we're trying to do with our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| and consultants' more strategic approach to multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| is what we call respectful development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| having development that accommodates multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| but does it in a way that's respectful of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| whether that's mixed-use development that incorporates retail and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| townhomes and courtyard apartments, duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| again, buildings that fit in with the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| and provide opportunity for more people to live in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| but do it in a way that's respectful of the character of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| The RN4, the small-scale multifamily and RN4 is an effort to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| There are great examples here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| and throughout the state and region and nation of development that's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| so that it fits in with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| It's hard to tell, but in many cases, these are multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| or they actually become defining buildings in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| Moving from that, we've had a number of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| about duplexes in the single-family districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| Again, this is not a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Duplexes are used on review in our current R1 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| They would remain a special use in the R1N and the R2N single-family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| This is a chart that shows the number of applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| and approvals for duplexes for the past 15 years plus, from 1992 until 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2823)|
| 0:47:13| There hasn't been a number of applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| There's no groundswell of applications for duplexes in the single-family districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| In some cases, keep in mind the blue is the number of applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| The orange is the number of approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| I don't know why some of the applications were not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| I know in the last year, the last one, they had some challenges from the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| There were some concerns from the neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| and also the site was challenging that they were trying to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| While we see this as a tool that helps address affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| the availability of housing, based on the past history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| there won't be a lot of activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| and I don't know why the duplexes are not a more viable option for people in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| Maybe that will change in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| We are providing the opportunity for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| but we don't see it being the immediate problem that some in the community might be apprehensive about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2889)|
| 0:48:19| There are residential districts where duplexes are not allowed, like R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2899)|
| 0:48:27| R1E and the EN, they're permitted if the lot size is significantly larger, or in corner lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| If I'm understanding your chart correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| what you're saying is that in areas where duplexes are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| you're not seeing a lot of applications, nor are you seeing a lot of people building duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| But we're expanding where duplexes could be in the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| If we're not seeing a need for it out there expressed in the marketplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| why are we then adding more space for duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| I think this points to Council Member Singh-Perez's comment that we're looking generations ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| We know that we're looking forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| We're not looking backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| We're trying to provide those opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| and create more opportunities for housing in Knoxville and appropriate places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| This goes back to some of these respectful development slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| We have designed standards for duplexes now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| and proposed in the ordinance that don't exist in the existing ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| so that we can make sure or try to make sure that those duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| if they do become a go-to for developers and for housing types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| that we have standards to ensure they fit in with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| We're looking forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| Any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Are we moving on from residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| I'm a little slow on uptake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| There's a lot to process here, even though I've read through the draft on multiple occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| So I'd like to go back, if it's okay, Gerald, to the bring back the orange concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| I don't even need to go back to the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| I am struggling with this one a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| because I'm trying to figure out in my own mind how to balance what I'm seeing on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| which is some great single-family neighborhoods with nice, small, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3032)|
| 0:50:43| I can see, and I have seen in other cities, the potential for teardowns in those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| and the potential of loss of affordable single-family housing for the development of multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3050)|
| 0:51:00| And I don't think that's the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| I think that's what you're trying to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| That's what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Also, on the other hand, I'm struggling with the idea that we're potentially downzoning existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3067)|
| 0:51:18| So do you see my struggle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| I know I have that struggle, and in talking with other staff, we have the same struggle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| and it goes to Councilmember Wallace's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| We are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Then I hear from a CAT staff person that there's an apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| a large apartment complex on a street that they can't provide transit service to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| because the street won't accommodate the transit, and there are a number of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| So how do we balance all those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| I do think that the RN-4 and the small-scale multifamily standards help address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| because they keep the scale of the development somewhat in line with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| We need, we are going, we and staff are going to look at where we can strategically apply the RN-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| and also we need, again, I look to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| We need help from the community in identifying those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| I don't think, or I know that some of the places that are zoned are too now not appropriate for multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3137)|
| 0:52:25| because there are affordable, smaller, single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| There's not the infrastructure that can accommodate the multifamily that could be developed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| It would be totally out of character with those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| So how do we balance all those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Any direction that any of the council members have or the community has that we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| and do it better than it was done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| You know, I think that Councilman Wallace made a suggestion of looking at the RN-5 zone as a potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| I think another potential would be to look at an RN-2 adding multifamily back as a special use potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3180)|
| 0:53:10| I mean, at least that would, I know that, you know, there's a process involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| I'm just, again, trying to balance this in my mind because I know that this is an issue that other cities struggle with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| and I know how important that small, single-family, affordable, you know, not just for affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| but also just for neighborhood character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| It's important to have that and a diversity of housing options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| and I can see that those houses could potentially become teardowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Well, I think then you've got to go back and look at the, and maybe use the road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| If it's a neighborhood street, maybe it doesn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| I mean, I think you've got to have some reason to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| If it's on a major arterial and you're down zoning it from R-2 to just one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| you know, that's something we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| I would use, and I saw that email from Kat as well, and I think she makes a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| but I don't think you want to eliminate that they can maybe have a small-scale multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| I mean, it would be poor choice on the developer to put that unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| that many apartments down at the end of the road where you couldn't get public transit to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| So that developer is going to look at it as well and think, well, that's not really going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| If I can't get residents, you know, to public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| So, I mean, it goes both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| But I think you've got to look at the road classification and then go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| And that's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Actually, I'll commend Tim Coon because he suggested that we look at road classifications where they are in poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| Again, not to offend anyone, developers, but especially my friend Tim Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| but we've seen lots of cases where apartments are built where transit can't get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| And so I think we need to be cognizant of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| and be careful that we provide the direction because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| developers that haven't worked, they often may not think about Kat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| They may think that if we've zoned a property for multifamily, it has the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| So we need to be cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| I think public transit is much more considered today than it was even five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| So I think that's maybe our past sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| And I think developers have learned that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| So, you know, it's not all lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| I think your point about the roads is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| And we've talked about certain key intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| and, again, trying to be more strategic and balance the competing interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| I think someone mentioned some places where duplexes are permitted without a special review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3348)|
| 0:55:59| This is the number of duplexes in those districts where they're permitted without any special review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| And there have been 169 since 2005 and 12 on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| I think those years where there have been spikes in some of those are KCDC projects, Lonsdale, Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3373)|
| 0:56:23| There were a number of duplexes built in the early part of this century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| So those high numbers in certain years may be because of KCDC influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| But, again, even where they're permitted, duplexes are not a great go-to for developers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| They may be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| But, again, we are trying to provide opportunities for housing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| If there are no more questions about residential, I'll go to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| Or if you have questions, a question pops up later, feel free to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| Just go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Kind of back to Andrew asking about definitions and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| One of the things that I keep hearing that I wonder about the definition is the unique character of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| A lot of zoning that was done, Knoxville is a very segregated city, both financially and racially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| So when we say unique characteristic of a neighborhood, does that mean we're just trying to keep that standard going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| That's a very good question and a very tough question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| I've been hammered from both sides on that one, that allowing duplexes and ADUs will destroy the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| or that we're working too hard to maintain and we're trying to maintain a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| I think we want an opportunity for people to live in all types of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| If a single family now has limited street connectivity, limited street width, then maybe that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| Take all those into account, and the character of single family, and it should remain single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| because it does not have the infrastructure to accommodate multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| Now, I'd say that's the same in West Knoxville, North Knoxville, South Knoxville, and East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| If that's the built character, then we'll try to maintain that, but we also want to provide opportunities for more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| so we're trying to do that in keeping with that character, that overall character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| which is defined by the housing types, the infrastructure, and the ability to access and provide services to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3510)|
| 0:58:40| It's a tough question and it's hard to balance those two things, so I appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| I've actually got a lot of questions about residential, so I don't know if now is the right time to do it or if we should finish the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| No, let's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Let's just go? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| Mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Knoxville Code Chapter 256A indicates that mobile homes are only permitted in trailer camps, mobile home parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| with the exception being those permitted before July 20th, 1971.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| In the draft Article 9.3, Principal Use Standard Subsection H, Number 3, as well as 16.3, Nonconforming Structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3555)|
| 0:59:27| is this intended to allow single-wide manufactured homes outside of those designated areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3567)|
| 0:59:36| It would not allow new homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| It does what allow the replacement of an existing single-wide, an old one that's deteriorating or has a leaking roof or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3578)|
| 0:59:51| so not permitting a new one on a new location but allowing the replacement of existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| So is that going to be clear in the draft that we're talking about replacement of existing structure, not it being outside of that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3598)|
| 1:00:11| I'll ask the rest of that since she's drafting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Yeah, there's a couple things to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| We do allow for, as you currently do now, I think the one thing to clarify is that when you hear the term mobile home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3616)|
| 1:00:25| and then manufactured home, mobile home relates to a date that I think is a HUD code was set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| so it's kind of the standard to which they're built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| So mobile home is pre, I think you said, 73. That sounds right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| So that's a structure built pre-73, and then manufactured home is now the term used with the new code that's established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| moving forward from that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| So right now what we do allow, we do allow a manufactured home dwelling that is a double-wide to be used as a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3647)|
| 1:00:57| It's got standards associated with it like you do now regarding it's got to meet building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| It's got to look like it would be a standard-built home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| All the stuff has to be taken off so it's not mobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| so it's really continuing a permission you have now that allows those to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| The non-conforming section looks at those areas where you have, and this one that is permitted has to be a double-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| So where you have single-wide manufactured homes or where you may have an old single-wide mobile home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| what we've allowed for in the non-conforming section is for that's existing, that can be replaced with a single-wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| but that's the only case where you can have that, just where it exists right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| and that's the language you see in the non-conformity section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| So is there a difference between mobile home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| So mobile home, single-wide mobile home is what you would envision this 1970s version being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| that we're saying you can only replace, not expand. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| You could replace, the ones that are out there, the way we've written the non-conforming section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| is you can replace a single-wide with a double-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| Once you do that, you can't go back. You have to have a double-wide then from that point on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| but we've allowed it to be replaced in kind, acknowledging that there's some of those out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| But then I guess my question is, is the new term manufactured home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| that isn't really necessarily referring to the single-wide term that was dealt with in the chapter that I quoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3746)|
| 1:02:34| This is something that is just maybe manufactured on an assembly line and then brought in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| but when you bring it in, it looks like a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| No, that's modular housing, and that's just a type of construction, and we've defined that in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| We've talked about modular housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| That's just, it's basically, if not sometimes even better than just traditional stick built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| because of the way it's constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| This is specifically referring to what people would colloquially call a mobile home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| but a manufactured home is the more modern version because of that change in the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| to which they need to be built that occurred in 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| Okay. So are we expanding the area where manufactured homes would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3789)|
| 1:03:16| outside of what is in the code currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| I don't believe so. We've just carried over what's in the current code right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| We've updated the terminology and carried it over, but we have allowed for where they are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| they can be replaced, but you can't add new single wides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| I don't know, anyone else have any mobile home questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| I'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| You can't replace, I'm sorry, I'm trying to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| You cannot replace a mobile home, but you can with a modular home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| No, the way that the non-conforming section is if you have a single wide mobile home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| wherever it is, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| The way the non-conforming is, it allows you to replace it with a new model that is single,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| that is a new single wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| That's the only case where you can have the single wide model is if you're replacing one in kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| And the area that modular homes are allowed in is not being expanded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| Modular homes are allowed, the term modular is a type of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| That's just a single family house, so that's allowed wherever you have a single family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| Modular is built to building code on a foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| It's just a type of construction like you would have stick built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| So it's just a way to build a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| So we're not even touching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| We've defined it just to clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| What we're talking about is a manufactured home, a house on wheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| And that area has not been expanded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| No, the permissions you have now have just been carried over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| The only thing that we've allowed for additional is if you've got a single wide now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| because the code doesn't allow for a single wide, you can replace it in kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| If you replace it with a double wide, you can't go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| So it's meant to build in just a little bit of flexibility to those that have it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| to encourage people to kind of upgrade, because we've heard of instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| and I've seen it in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| These much older single wide, because the city said no, no more of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| they're allowed to fall into really bad states of disrepair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| because people don't have the ability to change it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| and they can't afford a double wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| So what we've said is that if it's there right now, you can replace it in kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| That's the only places those are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| My concern is it's not something that people desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| but it is something that's affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| I mean, it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| It all kind of depends on how it works out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| but it is yet another type of housing option that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Yes, I had, I guess, a question about the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| and sort of how you went about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| In the R2, it says that the one, there was an addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| and it says they're relatively small lots with smaller setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| But if you look at the minimum setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| it looks like it's more or less the same as R1 and R3 and R4 and R5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3969)|
| 1:06:19| So is there a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| Because it seems like in some of the older neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| there are a lot of residential homes built almost within five feet of the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| I think the key here is that there's a distance 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| or the average of the block face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| So that would mean that if you're on a block, you have a vacant lot on a block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| and the rest of the block is built out, you go to the average of those existing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| We're trying to accommodate the existing neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| built neighborhoods through that method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| So if you wanted to build, like on Baxter where they tore down all the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| that I think were pretty close to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| would they be able to build them close to the street or down the whole block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4026)|
| 1:07:14| There it would have to be 25 feet, and that's a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| although that may be a great location for the RN4, and we'll look at that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| I've still got a bunch of residential questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| Electric vehicle charging stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| I was confused about those in RN1 and RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| When they're in those two zones, are they for both private and public use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| or are they private use only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| You and I had discussed this, and I thought we had a good understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| and we had a long discussion, and is Aaron here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| I'll try to let her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| I'm going to let Arista summarize Aaron's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| Director Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| It went into the cost, how much it would cost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| purchase a charging station and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| Peter, for the record, just tell us who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| I'm Peter Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| I'm the Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| I'm on the road show with Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Obviously you can't run a business in your residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| and so we have not limited or capped the number of charging stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| permitted on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| I don't know how many vehicles you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| I don't know if you have a collection of electric vehicles that you want to have charging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| or you have guests from out of town that want to charge at your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4139)|
| 1:09:10| It was just the language was confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| I wasn't sure whether we were talking about when I'm envisioning this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| I'm envisioning this as something that the homeowner is going to use to charge their own vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| It didn't seem clear to me whether it was public or private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| And your point about the business, I think, is well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| Yeah, and I think that's the only clarification we need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| The edit makes it look a little wonky, I'll admit, as we look back on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| The intent is, as Peter said, you can't run a charging business in your residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| And so the idea is when this was written and that phrase that's been preserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| was when we were looking at it as part of, say, a parking lot use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| which would be more in the commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| So what we can say is that the vehicle charging stations can't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| I'll figure out the language, but can't be used for commercial purposes in any residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| It's not a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| That was my only point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| I just wanted to make sure that we got that cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| Director Ahrens, you may want to stick around for the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| Article 10 removes the existing fence requirement for swimming pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| Yes, it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Why are we doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Here's why we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| The building code regulates swimming pools more effectively than our zoning code does right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| There's a lot of things in our zoning code that are lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| As a policy, I've directed my building inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| For instance, our current zoning ordinance does not regulate self-closing, self-latching gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| It doesn't regulate the opening limitations around the latches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| There's countless things that are lacking that, as a policy, I'm telling them, no, we need to enforce these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4251)|
| 1:11:01| The building code does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| That's where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| It's established over decades of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| And so the intent behind swimming pool fences is to keep toddlers out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| and young children, that's why you've got, out of the building code, your latch needs to be 54 inches above the grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| And you can't have, if it's less than that, you can't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| It's got to be on the inside and you can't have any openings greater than half inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| There's a lot of technical details that are already articulated in the building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| So we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| We're going to rely on them and supplement them with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| I think it's the Katie Beth law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| If we do that, are we not giving local control over to the state in the form of what somebody's doing in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4307)|
| 1:12:00| or what's going on with the building code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| Because things could change and we would be left with nothing in our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| The state allows us to regulate ourselves as far as the building code is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| I know we're taking a strange tangent here, but we're, I forget the term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| but they've basically granted us the authority to enforce our own codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| So this fall, when we intend to adopt the 2018 family of building codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| we're going through to see how we want to amend them if we do at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| So we have that right and the authority to regulate how we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| I guess I would just pose that as to, I don't know if the intent of council is to take some of these things out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| and give authority to someone other than local control in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| It's still local control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| It's still my department, but it's in the technical building code side versus the land use zoning side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| Another term that you had mentioned was running a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| so I wanted to ask about home occupations in Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| This has removed the current standard limiting 25% of dwelling for use in home occupations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| prohibiting sales of products other than those products produced on the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| and restricting on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| I guess my question on that one would be, again, why are we removing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4411)|
| 1:13:39| Well, the provision on restricting something to 25% of the home is essentially unenforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4419)|
| 1:13:48| How do you get in there and figure out that only 25% of a dwelling is being used for that home occupation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| It's something that a lot of codes used to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| and over time people have just taken it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| The idea is these are more performance-based standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| and so if the business, the home occupation that's going on inside of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| starts to run more like a regular business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| you've got the standards in place to shut it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| and tell them they need to move to a commercial district where they're more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| It's just really hard to calculate what that 25% is, and it's mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| So you say, okay, I'm coming in to check your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| You shove everything into a corner, and okay, I'm at 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| What's the rationale on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| In terms of the others, the other was the elimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| I'm sorry, the other questions on home occupation were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| Oh, I hadn't gotten to it, but I'll mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| That was on daycare was the next one I wanted to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| The existing standards for daycare and residential zones are changed in what we're seeing in the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4483)|
| 1:14:51| and they're replaced, again, by whatever the minimum standard that the state has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| So right now our standard is for no more than six children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| There's a minimum lot size, and there's an outdoor square footage requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| So my question about this, I think some of these were put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| because residents are trying to live in a single-family development in their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| and they don't want to have businesses really operating next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| Now, there are some that make sense, like having a daycare, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| But when we give away authority for local control here, maybe we don't get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4525)|
| 1:15:33| And so I'm not so sure why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| I don't know that the intent of council is to do that in these instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| Well, I will say specifically to the idea of daycare home, we didn't want to run that as a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| We wanted it as a principal use that would be allowed in a single-family district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| So we've regulated it separately in Article 9 as a principal use of it, so in terms of the daycare homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| I kind of need to turn it back to staff regarding typically the state does come out in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| and I think we're continuing to look at this in terms of daycare, what the state requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| and for the licensing out of the state, you're going to need to comply with those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| So I have to turn it back to staff if there's any other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| I know we were discussing a bit about daycare yesterday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| I think the intent there was our regulations were so similar to the state regulations when it comes to home daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| and it's not an either-or situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| Either we enforce it or they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| They always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| So it became complicated to manage that when dealing with applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| They're like, well, wait a minute, we've got all of our state stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| What are you doing differently and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| And so because I think it was a one-person difference as far as numbers, we found it to be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4610)|
| 1:17:01| If we want to keep it at six, if it's that important, we can do that, I would imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| Well, how long have we had these in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| Before either of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| Well, I guess that's what my point is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| It's just that I understand we're looking for some efficiency here, and that makes sense, and I'm all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| But when we start removing some of these things, they could change without us really knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| The state could change whatever their minimum requirements are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| and then we're left, we don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| So if there's not something that we're seeing here that is broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| I'm not sure why we're going to eliminate these standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| I'll speak and reiterate what Peter said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| Our first approach was instead of having duplicate standards that were very similar but just barely different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| for example, the case of daycare homes, the city standard had no more than six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| the state standards no more than seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Someone looks at one set of standards and said, I've been approved, then comes to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| and we have to say, no, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| We've got a slightly different set of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| Again, it was trying to, some efficiency but some avoiding duplication of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| However, if it's council's direction that we maintain that uniqueness, we'll certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| We know where to find the existing standards for daycare homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| and we can put them back in if that's what council and the community desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| Well, I just wanted to bring that up because I'm seeing these things coming out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| and so we should, let's figure out what the intent is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| Again, the intent was to reduce confusion, reduce duplication of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4722)|
| 1:18:49| and try to, in some extent, to be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| If there's one level of government enforcing something with a set of standards that's very similar to ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| do we need to also enforce a similar set of standards that may be slightly different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| Again, we're trying to be efficient, which may not always be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| Efficiency may not always be the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| We just need to hear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| We also have had several occasions where the standards that we enforce right now are more suburban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| and we have had several in the four and a half years that I've been here that are on smaller lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| that aren't able to meet our standards but meet the state's, and they want to open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| And we're like, no, you have to go and get variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| So we saw that, and a lot of times the variance, well, most every one of the variances were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4776)|
| 1:19:44| and we just saw that as an unnecessary hurdle because we know that the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| which is a higher government, saw it, approved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| and a lot of times it had to do with setbacks or the amount of space outside for the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4795)|
| 1:20:03| and that works great in a suburban environment, but the urban areas could not meet our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4803)|
| 1:20:12| Well, and I bring it up for that exact purpose, which is if we're going to remove these standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| which we've had for longer than you guys have been around, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| why don't we need to have that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| We shouldn't just pull that out without at least being brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| so I wanted to make sure we brought it up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| Dogs would be the next thing I was going to ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| Currently, a kennel is defined as any lot or premises on which five or more dogs more than six months old are kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4834)|
| 1:20:43| In the draft, there are an unlimited number of dogs allowed, as far as I could read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| And I told you we were going to get into the weeds, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| That's what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| Doggone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| Yeah, so what we've done is we've made the distinctions for animal care facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| and then animal breeders, or we talk about where people would breed dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4875)|
| 1:21:23| Any types of limitations on animals, it's usually something you would find in the animal control ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| which is really the appropriate place for it to be kind of regulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| because that's the group that takes care of all those issues related to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| We're just looking at the use and kind of where these uses would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| The regulations on the animals themselves would be in that animal control ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| Okay, and so do we have something in the animal control ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| that would substitute for what's being removed here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| We will check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| And the other thing is we do have the limitations where we do talk about kind of what these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| If you don't have that, then we can bring that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| Okay, and I love dogs, by the way, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| I just was curious about this being taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| Okay, another one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| In Article 9, what is the definition of sight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| We actually discussed that, and we're going to change that to lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| We already flagged that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| In the office zone O, has eating and drinking establishments been deleted, which I think it has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4961)|
| 1:22:49| but then what about retail goods establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| We noted that in our staff and consultant meeting yesterday that we would pull that out as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| It would no longer be permitted in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| We actually discussed that prior to draft two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| and it was the one thing that we as a city directed the consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| and they didn't do it out of the countless pages of directions they gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| They only missed that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| I would like Gerald to know that I keep meticulous notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| and we're going to find out if I really did get an email on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| I may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| I dream about the recodes, and maybe it was in my dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| You know, doing my review, I kind of felt your pain on that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| You know, I think I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| The rest of it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| I do have some commercial stuff I want to talk about too, but in the planned development zone PD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5024)|
| 1:23:52| are structures and parking areas required to be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| and the adjacent land uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| Without looking at that section, I don't know if we address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| I'll let Arista look for it while I answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| In the review, there's actually a three- or four-level review for planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| First, the applicant meets with staff, finds their plan, gets the plan through staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| Then it goes to MPC for the preliminary plan, then to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| City Council, with MPC and City Council review being at a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| City Council can place conditions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| Those conditions are reflected in a revised plan, final plan, that goes back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| So during that process, there's certainly the opportunity for our role as staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5080)|
| 1:24:48| and as planning commissioners and as the City Council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| is to ensure that that development is compatible with the adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| So I'd say even if it's not written at this point, it's certainly an unspoken thing that we would look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| And I'll let Arista answer if it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| If it's not, it's certainly something that could be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| It's in there in a number of the different, both the purpose statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| as well as kind of when you look at the exceptions from district regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| The intent, it's important to note in the way that we've crafted the plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| it's not a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| It's an approval process that lays on top of a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| And each of the districts are structured to be, you know, to have a compatibility within them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| That's the basis of a zoning district that they will develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| So essentially what plan development does is it works with that base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| It works with the district standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| And as you look to get exceptions from those, you're trying to prove how this makes it a better development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| which includes compatibility with the surrounding land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| and not having negative impacts on neighboring property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| And those standards are in there in the evaluation sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| So there may be some need there to kind of clarify that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of them are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| The intent is because you are doing something a little bit different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| but you're really looking at all the different aspects that make up the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| And then there is the issue of the public good coming back as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| And I'll wrap up my residential remarks with accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| which I appreciate you all talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| And I know I've talked about them before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| and I know I've had a lot of contact from my constituents about accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| And I wanted to get a sense for the purpose of the accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5191)|
| 1:26:39| Is this really, I guess, the intent here to increase a homeowner's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| to participate in the providing of affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| We're just trying to make more housing available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| And we understand that it's not going to be a groundswell of accessory dwelling unit permits requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5213)|
| 1:27:01| because of the cost, the complexity of having someone on your property living on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| But it is another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| The way, and this gets into how a zoning ordinance cannot address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5229)|
| 1:27:16| in the state of Tennessee, address affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| but it can address availability of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| And we've looked at state statute keep Knoxville from mandating affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5242)|
| 1:27:30| It's not the purview of zoning ordinances to address the cost of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| We can try to make more options for providing housing available, and we've tried to do that through ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| Duplexes is a special use in the R1N and R2N districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| What we'll do with the small-scale multifamily, R and 4, the mixed uses along our corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5265)|
| 1:27:53| trying to strategically map locations for multifamily housing and multifamily zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| So we're taking a broad approach to increasing the availability of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| in the hopes of providing for more housing where you impact the cost of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| And Gus, in a roundabout way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| So if we require short-term rentals to be owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| why don't we do the same thing at a very minimum with ADUs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| I know that I had proposed some solutions in the first draft workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| that weren't noticeably absent in the second draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| but I'm just asking in a minimum sense, and maybe this is a better question posed to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| is, you know, is owner-occupied kind of a minimum standard we should look at with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| I'll start answering that, and I think Peter or Mr. Ahrens will finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| but I'll use myself as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| As I said in transparency, I have a basement apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| Well, I could rent my basement apartment now or let my in-laws live in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| or, even more frightening, let my daughter come and live in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| But Peter may know that I own the house and I'm occupying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| but next year my wife, one of those infrequent lottery tickets, she wins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| and we are on a sailboat in the Caribbean, and I rent my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| Peter won't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| And my home went from being compliant as owner-occupied to noncompliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| but no one knows that except me and maybe the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| but, you know, I've told my neighbors that please be quiet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| and I'll share my lottery winnings with you or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| I think, you know, it's a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| It's a great hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| But what I'm getting to is a challenge in enforcing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| and knowing if the owner actually is occupying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| and I'll let Peter pick up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| Yeah, it falls under enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| and our inability to register rental properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| STRs are a different animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| They're a temporary animal versus the ADU, which is permanent features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| It's a second dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| And so whereas an STR, we've got a process by which somebody's licensed to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| and we can track that legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| I don't know how we would track owner occupation for a permanent structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| because Gerald's going to leave, he's going to get fed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| and he's going to sell it to somebody who's just going to rent the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| I don't know how I would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Well, most of the comments that I have received about accessory dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| has been not wanting to see them in residential single-family developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| or neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| And I'll interject there because if they're not permitted there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| then we don't permit them because they're only accessory to a principal dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5450)|
| 1:30:57| So I think that what you're hearing is that we don't want them at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| so not that we don't want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| I've not heard anyone say that they don't want them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| Just in certain areas where they haven't had these type of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| and it's really been designed for single-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| I can understand the point that's being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| The question I was having is the folks that I hear from in the same areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| that are for doing this say that they'd like to see a place for their aging parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5480)|
| 1:31:28| maybe to be able to stay closer to home, and maybe their kids like we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| And so one potential way I could see of bridging that divide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| would be to have something about an owner occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| I don't know that anyone's going to be upset with Director Green for having an ADU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| if it's a permitted thing, and then he leaves to go on this great vacation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| that he has after winning the lottery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| I don't think anyone's going to call Director Ahrens about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| I think what they're more concerned with is that somebody is going to maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| take up a lot of the housing and adding additional units into their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| not so much that it's the family themselves that are allowing for additional residents there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5533)|
| 1:32:21| with the ADU, but that it's some outside group that's doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5541)|
| 1:32:28| So I bring that up again so we can have some discussion about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| and I think that if it's enforceable with the short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| I think it's probably enforceable with the ADUs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| I could be proven wrong, but I'm just thinking it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| And we appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| We've heard a lot of comments about ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| and I think I would not have thought when we started this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| that that would be the source of the most comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| but I'm glad I can still be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| Are there further questions about residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| I think that the rules that you're talking about may end up limiting homeowners' options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5589)|
| 1:33:17| when they're selling their property, and to me, limiting your rights is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| Also, most of the comments that we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| I think that you've tried to do a very good job with outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| but 53% of Knoxvillians are renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| and most of the comments that we've gotten are from single-family homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| So it's up to us to represent that voice that we haven't heard from the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| And for that, I think ADUs are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5624)|
| 1:33:51| And one thing we have not done yet is tallied up the input from the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| that NPC entered into with SEED, CALL, and the Center of Hispano| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| in trying to reach out to a more diverse sector of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| So we will tally those and get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| Hopefully that will help balance all of the, and what you correctly stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| more from single-family homeowners in terms of our input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| Will there be more outreach as the next draft comes forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| We'll get into that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| You're jumping ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| I've got to save some of your something for my parting shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| I'll be patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| Any other questions on residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| If not, I'm going to suggest we take about a five- or six-minute break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| and reassemble at 712.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| And if we can all find our seats, we'll reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| And just a note, those in the audience, I know sometimes you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5693)|
| 1:35:03| and here's a great example of the difficulty, you have difficulty hearing what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5703)|
| 1:35:10| So if we please keep our comments very quiet to one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| so people around you can understand the proceedings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| What happened to Andrew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| There he'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| Back at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5735)|
| 1:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| Mr. Green, are you ready to now wade into the commercial district standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| A couple of things we became aware of with our commercial standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| that we did not have something that would address what we call the downtown edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| Emory Place, going down Broadway, Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| And so we've started maybe a bit more than just mentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| We actually have some things on paper drafting a downtown edge district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| The key issues that we're trying to deal with there are parking and design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| And we think we'll likely keep some base design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| and this is outside the downtown design review area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| so we'll let the downtown design review board, as they look at their standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| and work with city staff and the city administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| and ultimately city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| determine if that area needs design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| and comes under the purview of the downtown design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| Another big issue is parking, and we're still working through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| One approach we are contemplating is not requiring existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| to increase the amount of parking they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| So, for example, Emory Place, most of those buildings have no off-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| so they would not be required to provide off-street parking if the use changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| and they have to go through a permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| However, if there's a new development, they would have to meet parking standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| and we're trying to determine what that standard is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| We tentatively have settled on 60% of the required parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| In Section 11, there are parking requirements for all uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| In this area, they'd have to provide for new development and expansions of buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| they would have to provide 60% of the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| Again, we're still working through that, and we'll have something in the third draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| but that's something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Another issue that has come up, there have been some concerns about the height standards in CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| We went from 85 feet to unlimited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| We discussed that, gone back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| Our discussions yesterday were that we would leave it unlimited in the CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| but address the concerns through mapping, and map CG2 along the corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| like Kingston Pike, Chapman, Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| CG3 would only be at those nodes, and the nodes, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| picking up on the same example I used before along Kingston Pike nodes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| would be Western Plaza, Humber Place, and the intersection of North Shore and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5899)|
| 1:38:26| and that's to create more intensity of use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| We need direction from council on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| Is that appropriate for those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| I know we'll hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| Again, we'll refine the mapping of those areas, reduce the CG3 to use that only at nodes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| and CG2, which does have a height limit of 70 feet proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| do that along the corridors to try to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| Gerald, it does seem to me that along those corridors, or actually any height thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| is somewhat dictated by the expense the developer has to go to to go to whatever height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5940)|
| 1:39:08| I'm inclined to not put height restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| Now, if you're right up next to a residential area, certainly I want something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| I want maybe two or three floors or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| but beyond that, as you get further away and along those major corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| I think there's some real opportunities for some increased density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| and some real opportunities to make sure we do have housing available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| Again, we think we're going to try to address that concern about height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| and I can understand the concerns that people had of unlimited height along corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| but if those nodes at certain locations away from residential areas, more removed, may be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5980)|
| 1:39:49| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| We're still assessing the comments we've received on materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| and I know I still hear John Sanders, again, representing the East Tennessee section of AIA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=5996)|
| 1:40:04| has provided some comments on materials, and we're still reviewing those, and we'll be making changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| We had a number of comments on materials, the limitation on materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| and how we would limit that and assess, and we're limiting the ability to use materials creatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6014)|
| 1:40:28| It is getting late, I guess, and I was saying I'd rather be ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| this is more fun than being at Falter, but maybe it's so much fun it's affecting my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6032)|
| 1:40:41| So we're assessing those, and just going back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| we're talking about commercial design standards here, but also there's been a policy direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| We had some base residential design standards that would apply to all residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| just minimum transparency, front door on the front of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| and some design standards for garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| The policy direction has been to remove those from all our residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| so we will not have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| That would be eliminated from the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| Any questions on those commercial district standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| And, again, this is just to repeat from our previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| and as was in the first draft and the second draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| there's CG, CG2, and CG3, CH1, CH2, CR1, and CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6091)|
| 1:41:40| Those higher number districts, for example, CG2 allows 70 feet and some design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6100)|
| 1:41:49| CG1, 35 feet, no design standards, less intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| As the intensity gets greater, there's some design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| What we're hoping is that the greater intensity permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| the greater height permitted to reduce setbacks results in a profit margin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6121)|
| 1:42:09| that enables the design to be enhanced a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| We have minimum design standards in those higher level 2 and 3, CG2, CG3, and CH2 and CR3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6132)|
| 1:42:22| There are some minimum design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| There's been a number of questions about non-conformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| One of the key issues in this is we're trying to move from here to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| How do we move something that's here to here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| How do we deal with something that was built under our existing code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| when we have a new code that sets different standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| There's a provision in Article 16 that talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| if something has been abandoned or discontinued for more than a certain length of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| then you cannot rebuild it or reuse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| We're expanding that or enhancing that definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| so it's made more clear what abandoned or discontinued is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| An actively marketing building means that it's being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| and we'll define actively marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| We realize that it takes a great deal of time to first put a building on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| for some type of use to then find a purchaser or lessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| go through the contract negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| actually enter into a contract and have a new person in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| So that actively marketing, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| if we have a building that's used as industrial in the commercial district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6219)|
| 1:43:47| and the commercial no longer allows that industrial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| that industrial use could move out as long as the marketing firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| the real estate firm or the owner is actively marketing that building for that industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| That industrial use could go back into it four years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| as long as it's being actively marketed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| Expansion of non-conforming buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| and I'll ask Peter to jump in whenever he needs to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| expansion of non-conforming buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| and I'll use Broadway Carpet as an example here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| because it's one that makes for a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| There likely will be proposed a CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| which has a build-to zone that you have to bring the building up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| Obviously, they don't do that with their existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| and I'll use this to represent the building just because it's easier to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| So this is their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| Here's the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| and they're set back 30, 40 feet from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| They have a build-to zone of 0 to 10 feet way up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| Well, they can come across with an addition that's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| under what we're going to allow with non-conforming buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| They cannot set their addition back farther from that build-to zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| but they don't have to build that addition up here and come way up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| They can maintain that same level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| or they can incrementally increase and come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| We're trying to make it easy for buildings that are in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| to expand and to continue to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| knowing that we have to get from here to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| Non-conforming residential lots, any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| I hope I explained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| Either I completely explained it or completely confused you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| so I'll take either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| Existing non-conforming residential uses, residential lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| if you have a lot that's below the minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| those few that are below the minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| you can build on them as long as you meet the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| That means that if you have a 4,500-square-foot lot and an RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| you can build on it as long as you meet the setbacks for that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| Peter or the rest of you want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| Okay. I'll keep rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| We did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| I met with the economic development staff of the Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| and we provided this information for them, and they also have a comparison map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| They used a comparison map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| and we're tweaking some of the industrial zoning to make it more compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| We may have overused the industrial mixed use and some of that on the next map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| The general industrial, the heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| but we're maintaining in our office and our industrial districts roughly the same acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| and we're actually 15 acres below on this chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| but we got a request from someone who wanted to go from commercial to industrial mixed use at 30 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| so we'll be 15 above at a minimum on the next map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| We're cognizant of the role that industry and office complexes play in Knoxville's economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6420)|
| 1:47:08| and we want to ensure that as we go forward that we provide ample opportunity for new businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| and industrial uses and the expansion of existing ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| We went over this earlier, and I'll just show it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| Currently about 20% of our residential lots are nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| in that they're smaller than the minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| and we'll go in the RN2 to 1.8% nonconforming and in the RN1 3.8%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6454)|
| 1:47:44| so we're greatly reducing the number of nonconforming lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| This is just a summary of the zoning in the new map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6468)|
| 1:47:55| Of our parcels, about 85% of our parcels are residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| or 59.6% of the land area down to our special districts are the natural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6480)|
| 1:48:09| the open space, the flood or natural area open space, and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6489)|
| 1:48:21| In this, we've had questions about the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| To remind you that we are placing the recommendations of the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| those density limitations and grading limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| into the zoning code for residential properties only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| Residential properties make up about 2,500 acres of the total 3,800 vacant acres in the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6519)|
| 1:48:55| When you add that 2,500 acres of the vacant residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| with almost 600 of the vacant special districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| which, again, are open space, natural areas, and agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| which tend not to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| If they are, they would be developed for residential purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| Then we're covering about 90% of our land area that's subject to vacant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6555)|
| 1:49:23| that's subject to the hillside area restrictions or hillside plan protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| Now, the parting shot I alluded to earlier, the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| As we know, I lined in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| As Vice Mayor Saunders said, this was identified as a 20-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| We're going to keep ARRESTA and CRESS around a bit longer as we go through the revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| that I'm sure will come through the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| The contract completion date was actually October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| I looked at it. It was October 1, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| So we're nearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| You can do this in a week. We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| Our next step would be the draft three of the code and the draft two map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| We decided yesterday we set a deadline of October 15th to have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| We're working with the Office of Neighborhoods on a series of five community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| The schedule got a little bit changed a bit yesterday, and I don't know the exact dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| but it'll start roughly October 22nd with those community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| and go through the final week in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| We do have a stakeholder advisory committee scheduled for October 24th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| that will review the third draft of the ordinance and second draft of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| It's on the Planning Commission agenda for November 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| and then it's to you in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| Again, as several council members said, we don't dictate the schedule of what you do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6657)|
| 1:51:03| That's up to you, and I do encourage you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| I concur with the statements from the council members of taking your time and working through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6666)|
| 1:51:14| The examples I have recall of where I assisted cities with comprehensive code updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6674)|
| 1:51:20| They did have special meetings to consider the code, especially the final adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| some workshops and then a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| If Mr. Frost will allow you to do that, I think that would be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6688)|
| 1:51:35| and certainly would keep people who are here for a proclamation or a retirement approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6695)|
| 1:51:44| from waiting all evening and into the night for their approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| First off, Director Green, I want to thank you because whenever I've had a question about any of these topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6715)|
| 1:52:03| you've always been very available, and I do appreciate all those times that we've had discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6723)|
| 1:52:11| This next one takes a little bit of time to set up, so I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| The existing zoning ordinance, Article 7, Section 6E, under text or map amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| says the following conditions shall be met for all amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| Further in 1D, the proposed amendments shall, again, be consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| and not in conflict with the general plan of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| Excuse me. I can answer your question, or you can continue setting it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| I could tell you that we instructed the consultant yesterday to put that back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| Okay, but the point being, though, that maybe folks didn't know what was in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6763)|
| 1:52:50| so maybe the setup is still important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| I understand that, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| Basically, to sum it up, the issue was whether or not we should return to the current language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6776)|
| 1:53:06| because what we're dealing with in the recode section was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6786)|
| 1:53:14| MPC recommendation and the City Council decision on map amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| is a matter of legislative discretion that is not controlled by any particular standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6798)|
| 1:53:24| Then it continues by saying that in making their recommendations and decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| MPC and City Council must consider the following standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| So my issue with that was, or my concern was, by removing the word shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| are we making these a series of conditions that might be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| as opposed to going to be applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| So that gives us the right background for the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| which is we're going back to the original terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| I think it's important to have that in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| because in the state of Tennessee, zoning map amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| shall be compliant with the general plan for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| So I think reiterating that in our code is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| and giving the council direction but also letting the public know that those standards shall be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6849)|
| 1:54:17| Okay, and this is another one, the last one I'll mention this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| This specifically has to do with eating and drinking establishments in the OP office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| but it brings up a follow-up question about a new term that we're seeing entered into the vocabulary here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6869)|
| 1:54:39| I'm very confused by the use of the word accessory use and ancillary use or ancillary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6879)|
| 1:54:52| When you're talking about eating and drinking establishments in the office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| is that intended to be used by the public or by those who work in the office park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| These terms and ancillary is a new word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| We don't have it currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Accessory is in there, and the definition for accessory use in the current version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| I think, is a little bit more clear than what is in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| So I'm trying to figure out what the difference between these two terms is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6918)|
| 1:55:26| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| So let me work two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| Number one, it's a term we bring out and see if people can get used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| Oftentimes in most communities they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| We're getting rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| We'll be converting it to a better term that does more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| It's literally a zoning trend I tried to make happen and only has succeeded about 30% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| What the intent of it is is to talk about how a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| So, for example, when you say I am a cultural facility, I'm a museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| So the main principal use there is the museum, the showing of artifacts, the displays and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| But a museum will also have a gift shop, which is retail services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6967)|
| 1:56:12| and it will have a cafeteria or a restaurant in there for the people coming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6972)|
| 1:56:16| So it's not just that the McDonald's that's in the basement is not a cultural facility, it's a McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| So the intent of using the term ancillary is to talk about how this main principal use has these bunch of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6982)|
| 1:56:29| often associated with it as just part of its integral function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| So that was the intent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| This seems to confuse a lot of people, so we're just going to rephrase everything and take that term out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| Well, and so that's what I thought you were getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| So if we're going to use an example of a hospital with a cafe inside of it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| Okay, so you can have a hospital without a cafe in it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| And if I'm planning to take my wife out to dinner, we're not going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| hey, let's go to the hospital cafeteria because that would be a great place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| So you're inviting people who are being serviced by that facility, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7020)|
| 1:57:10| You're inviting that into the parcel as opposed to if I have an office park and there's a McDonald's outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7030)|
| 1:57:18| then I'm inviting people from outside of the parcel to come in and eat at the McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7038)|
| 1:57:25| And so that's what I thought you were getting at, but it's not very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| So if that's something you think that we need to have in here, I'm okay with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| but let's make that very clear what that distinction is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| Yeah, I'm going to rephrase it for things like hospitals and cultural facilities where you have those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| You're not going to the museum McDonald's because you're not going to pay 25 bucks to get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| and then just go to that McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| In an office park, the intent of allowing that as a principal use was to allow to serve both the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| and the people that work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| I can't tell you how many family events I've gone to at the steakhouse in the office park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| in the suburbs that we've had to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| And so it's the intent that while the restaurants would primarily serve the people using the office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| there is some contingent that comes and visits there from outside of those that are working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7085)|
| 1:58:11| So for an office park, that's why we've allowed it as a principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| eating and drinking as a principal use in an office park district as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| But in all those other definitions where you saw it, we're going to fix that term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| and make it more clear what we mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| Okay, and I would just ask in that same light that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7104)|
| 1:58:31| I have to read some language like this for my day job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| and so it's not as foreign to me maybe as it may be to others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| but we really should make this so that folks can pick this up and read and understand what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| And I was struggling with these two to try to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| So I appreciate that I actually did pick up on what you were trying to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| but let's try to keep those in terms that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| somebody who has less experience dealing with these things would be able to pick up on what they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| Other questions or comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| I have questions for Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| I'd like to hear one of the key issues that we've identified obviously is ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7155)|
| 1:59:22| Accessory Dwelling Units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| Is it appropriate to keep moving forward with allowing Accessory Dwelling Units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| Do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| Or is there any thought, do we want to hear more comments from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| and see what the will of the community is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| Had you gotten to the part about outreach in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| Oh, the outreach in the future, some of it will be the five meetings that we've identified for the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7183)|
| 1:59:51| I'm sure I'll look at some of my partners who are still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| And we need Jennifer Roach and Amy Nolan to make sure we have plenty of opportunities to meet with the business community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7197)|
| 2:00:08| and I'll look to them to help us schedule some more meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| I'm sure they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| And I've never said no to individuals who want to come meet with me at the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7212)|
| 2:00:18| I will state once again that we don't have the resources to meet with every neighborhood group in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| We encourage the neighborhood groups to come to the community meetings in their area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| and participate in those broader meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| I think that's more productive for all of us to hear from a broader cross-section of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| And also, just quite frankly, we don't have the time to meet with every community group in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7239)|
| 2:00:47| but we try to arrange the community meetings so that the public can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| Our website will still be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Again, comments are accepted at any time because we set a deadline in order for us to incorporate comments into a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7254)|
| 2:01:02| It does not mean that you can't comment anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| Rusty didn't want me to say this, but even if we adopt the ordinance and someone makes a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7266)|
| 2:01:15| if it's adopted at midnight and someone makes a comment at 12.01 a.m. and it's a worthy comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| we'll look at it and come to you with a revision to the adopted code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| The last thing that we want is for this code to be static and not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| The community is changing quickly, and we need to keep up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| I've told some folks, and I'll continue to make the comment, that we'll review this after a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| and see what's working, what's not working, what we may need to tweak and come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| I'd like you to make a commitment as council and your successors to look at it every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| I hope I'm not here for the 25-year review of it, but I think you need to make sure that it's not static,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7310)|
| 2:01:58| that it continues to address the changing conditions in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| I have no idea why Gerald thought I'd be offended by that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| I agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| I wouldn't scare you away if you said the first amendment comes the day after a code is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| Yeah, that is actually true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| But the one thing I did want to say is that that is actually everything Gerald said is very, very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7336)|
| 2:02:22| A zoning ordinance, while you want it to be perfect and go 20 years into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| hitting everything that you anticipated, the chances of that happening are impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| That's not what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| Cities change, technology changes, the zoning has to keep up and adapt with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| The one thing that we've tried to do in this is we've tried to organize this document so that as you make amendments to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7357)|
| 2:02:43| it's much easier and doesn't create conflicts or internal inconsistencies so that, as you can see now with your use table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7363)|
| 2:02:50| you want to add a use or you want to take uses out of a district, it doesn't impact any of the other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| You can make those kind of surgical changes in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| So if you see that we didn't allow this use in O, but we want to allow it now, you can easily make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7378)|
| 2:03:05| One of the things we've done just in the basic organization of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| and how we've structured it is to make it easier for you to see what's working, what's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| and make those adjustments as needed each year into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7392)|
| 2:03:18| I think one of the big issues, and George Wallace raised it at the beginning, was the changing of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7398)|
| 2:03:28| I generally agreed with his comments that I think everybody here knows how difficult it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7408)|
| 2:03:37| and sometimes how long we wrestle with changing one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| So if we're changing the zoning for hundreds of parcels or thousands of parcels, how difficult that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7421)|
| 2:03:50| So I'd just sort of like to get your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| In the past we've done processes where we've changed certain neighborhoods on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| but I think that's something that will make it difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| I read the initial goals of the update, and it said the goals of the zoning ordinance update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7444)|
| 2:04:12| are to provide standards to guide the continued development and redevelopment of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| in a manner that uses resources efficiently, build a strong, sustainable, walkable community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| incorporate current and best planning practices, provide clarification and consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| remove contradictions or obsolete regulations, and incorporate graphic illustrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| while making the zoning ordinance simple, flexible, and easier to understand and administrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| Cameros was chosen as the most appropriate to undertake this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| So there was nothing in there about looking into if large swaths of neighborhoods were mis-zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7478)|
| 2:04:46| Maybe we need to look at that if they don't agree with the sector code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| but I'm not sure that this is the right process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| I'd be happy to hear thoughts on that or from other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| Well, I would say if not now, when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| This is the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| I've worked with several communities on zoning code updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| and not one has not addressed their zoning at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| I'd say that you're not living up to your responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7512)|
| 2:05:18| if you don't look at some of these communities and the zoning at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| This is the appropriate time, if not now, when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| We've identified the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| We've come to you with our professional recommendations on how to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| I don't think it's appropriate to have, and I'll use Brookhaven as multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7531)|
| 2:05:37| and this is the appropriate time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| It's not for me to make my professional recommendation, but this is the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| This is the appropriate time to zone this area, Rn4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| because it can sustain small-scale multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| it can provide it close to a transit corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| We're rezoning the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| This is the time to address those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| If you don't do it now, when will you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| Well, I mean, I guess that's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| I never envisioned this was a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| It was a recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| It wasn't just changing the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| It wasn't changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| You can't change the code without changing the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| We can't create new standards and keep our existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| They're hand-in-hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| And we have, to the extent, well, pretty much everywhere, if it's non-residential, it's non-residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7582)|
| 2:06:31| If it's non-residential now, it remains non-residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| If it's residential, it remains residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| We have tweaked some of those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| All the areas that are C4 now are not immediately commercial highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| because there's some locations along Broadway that are C4 highway commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| that don't meet our intent, our vision for the future if they were commercial highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7608)|
| 2:06:56| But, in fact, the suggested changes here would allow a mixed use in most of those instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7616)|
| 2:07:04| Well, I guess in the past when we've done this, we've typically allowed parcel owners to opt out, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| I'm not certain on that when we've rezoned, you know, sort of a blanket rezoning of an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7630)|
| 2:07:17| And you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| I'd say that gives you a pretty interesting zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| Well, I mean, anyway, well, I think, you know, Council Member Welch mentioned that, you know, she was resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| I think it's something that this body and, you know, MPC, we're going to have to wrestle with if we want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| how far those changes go because, you know, I think that's where people are going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7657)|
| 2:07:43| And if they're not paying attention and they come back in a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| and their property's been, you know, dramatically rezoned to something quite a bit different than it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| you know, I think that will create conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| And we've seen that before in other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| So I think it's something that, you know, is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| I agree there are areas that seem improperly zoned, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| I appreciate the work that you and your staff have done to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| But I think it also is difficult and wasn't my understanding that that was, you know, the intent of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7691)|
| 2:08:24| Ms. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| Yeah, I think I would ‑‑ I just want to say I think I understood from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| that that was partially the intent of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| particularly because from the very beginning we talked ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| we had some discussions about the commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| So in order to allow for mixed use on commercial corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7719)|
| 2:08:45| like that's changing the allowed use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| So I think we had some of those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| So if it's happening there, then I guess I just assumed that there would be other ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| I'm not saying it's not an important thing for us to consider and to weigh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| and I'm struggling with some of it myself because it's a really important decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| But it seems like we were, at least I was under the impression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| that some of that would be happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7750)|
| 2:09:13| particularly with the discussion around the commercial corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| and then that would also affect other zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7755)|
| 2:09:22| And I hate to use the term that was challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| to define the character of the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| but how can you preserve the character of Oakwood Lincoln Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| and zone it RN5, which is the equivalent of the current R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7774)|
| 2:09:40| How can you preserve the character of Brookhaven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| and zone it from RN5, which is the equivalent of R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| As I said before, we've got these competing goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| and the best that we can do as staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| is present you our best professional recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| If you want to preserve those affordable, single‑family neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| you can't zone them RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| If you want to provide for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| and sort of incentivize and direct higher density to your corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| you can't zone half the inner loop of the city within 640| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| and I don't know what the boundary would be south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| for multifamily, high‑density multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| You can't, if you want to provide transit services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| to multifamily developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| you can't zone Morelia Avenue for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7831)|
| 2:10:38| And that's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| It's a huge challenge, as Councilmember Welch said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| what we should be doing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| It's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| It's not easy to say we're making what we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| is a better development pattern in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| but we're taking away some of the development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| that someone may or may not know they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| I realize it's a tough issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| It's not something that's easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| and I don't mean to sound like I'm admonishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7873)|
| 2:11:19| or pushing you when I say this, if not now, when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| but this is the opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| This is the time when we're looking at the city comprehensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| We're not looking at one neighborhood or one property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| We're looking comprehensively at how will this city function best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| how can we most efficiently develop and meet our goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| looking at the city as a whole instead of area by area or lot by lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| Well, I mean, as Council, we have looked at neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| and down-zone neighborhoods since I've been on Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| so we have done it, not during a process like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| And so, I mean, it is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| I mean, I just think it's restful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| and I certainly understand that obviously every zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| is going to be different, and a lot of what you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| is a lot of the reason why I think people support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| is we wanted mixed use, we wanted to address setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| and some of those things, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| when a parcel is completely changed, you know, that owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| even if it's an R zone, I mean, an R1 is very different, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| than an R2 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| I mean, there's just a huge amount of, in terms of value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| and what you can do and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| and so, you know, it does affect that person's ability to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| I looked up on Council Member Welch's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| With the new zoning, we're proposed to allow mixed uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| taller buildings, more intense uses along all our corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| Should we go back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| you need a 25-foot front setback, your height limit is 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| and you need X number of parking spaces per square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| and you can't do residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| Because if we're doing it in one direction, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| it is a give and take, and it's for the community as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| so should we not change those also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| Well, I mean, I think, I mean, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| obviously if we can't change the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| and keep it the same at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| I mean, I think that's a given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| And, you know, in terms of, you know, when you add, like, commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| if you add the ability to do residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| the people that own that parcel that still want to do commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| can still do commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| and so you're not taking anything from that parcel owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| But if you have a parcel owner that bought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| thinking that someday they were going to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| that now they can't do, I think that is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| and creates more challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| What if that person had spent money to rezone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| to do a project at some certain time in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| and then we've changed back to a different zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| that's substantially different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| than what they actually went through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| and this council gave them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| So I think those are tough issues that, you know, we need to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| and maybe, you know, maybe there's a happy middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| for some of those neighborhoods that were talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| like, you know, the R3 and R4 that would be more compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| and sort of achieve both goals of what would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| But I think it's a hard decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| I think, you know, that's what we're tasked with doing in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8067)|
| 2:14:37| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| Gerald and Kamios, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| You all have done an exhaustive job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| I know we're not finished, but we are edging up on some conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| and it will, of course, be massaged at council after we receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| We do have a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| and we have nine people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| So I will simply go down the list and call the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| and if you are still here, please come forward and make whatever remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| Louise Gorenflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| If you would come up and please give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8118)|
| 2:15:24| I don't know if I can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| I just wanted to say McKenna Middlebrook with the NAACP had to leave for another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8128)|
| 2:15:36| Well, she had signed up second, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| Louise Gorenflow, 2306 Sunnywood Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8141)|
| 2:15:47| And thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| So Councilman Roberto asked for visions, so here is a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8150)|
| 2:15:58| Climate change unfolds as the largest game changer our city faces in terms of how we live and move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8158)|
| 2:16:05| We witness an ever more massive reordering of our civilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8165)|
| 2:16:10| as we move deeper into the age of climate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| The policies and infrastructure that the city puts in place today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| will have a large impact on how well Knoxville weathers the worsening storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| Future plans need to be focused both on reducing our carbon emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| and to adapting to the all-encompassing effects of climate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| If we imagine the future will resemble the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| then we dangerously ignore the reality of climate change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| and put ever more people in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| It is critically important that we align our zoning map with transit-oriented development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8203)|
| 2:16:49| so that the city has a bone structure we need to move toward a zero-carbon emissions economy by 2050.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8209)|
| 2:16:57| Zoning codes do affect our community's carbon emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| Compact neighborhoods typically generate 20 to 40 percent less vehicle travel per capita| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8221)|
| 2:17:09| than conventional lower-density neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| An EPA study found that travel to a building often uses as much energy as consumed in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8232)|
| 2:17:20| Residents reduce total building and transportation energy consumption 64 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8240)|
| 2:17:27| by living in an attached energy-efficient green home in an urban location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8247)|
| 2:17:33| and by 75 percent by living in a multifamily energy-efficient home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| compared with the same household living in a typical detached single-family house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8258)|
| 2:17:44| in an auto-dependent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| Housing location and type have greater impact on total energy use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| than do vehicle or home energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| Transit-oriented development has many other benefits besides climate mitigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8276)|
| 2:18:02| affordable housing, strong transit systems, vibrant communities, and attraction of talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| Transforming the way our city develops is a long-term enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| but removing the zoning barriers to multifamily housing by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8292)|
| 2:18:17| and transit-oriented development opens the way for these infrastructural changes to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8297)|
| 2:18:23| so that we may reap the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| Good news is that many within the city, especially our mobility agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| understand and value transit-oriented development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| Increasing density along our transit corridors, as pictured by CAT in its comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8314)|
| 2:18:40| is the important step that only RECODE Knoxville can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| Coupled with the city investments in these same areas to make them more equitable, walkable, and bikeable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8324)|
| 2:18:51| we'll reduce carbon emissions and prepare our city for a climate-changing world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8336)|
| 2:18:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| Next, we have Danny Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| Is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| If you would please give us your name and address and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8346)|
| 2:19:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| My name is Danny Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| My wife, Mary, and I live at 321 East Innskipp Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| I appreciate this opportunity to speak, especially concerning the RECODE Knoxville and the part of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8363)|
| 2:19:36| We participate in the Innskipp Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| which has helped increase our sensitivity to changes being made in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8380)|
| 2:19:48| Five years ago, the Innskipp area was rezoned with the specific objectives of maintaining the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8388)|
| 2:19:55| and limiting further development by rezoning as many properties as possible to R1 and R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8395)|
| 2:20:04| My wife and I did not object to the project as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| However, we and five other homeowners asked for and received permission from city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| to maintain R2 zoning for our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| Mary and I attended the RECODE Knoxville launch meeting at the public works complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8418)|
| 2:20:25| We had been notified through our community association and seen news stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| with the statement that the project would affect everyone in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8430)|
| 2:20:36| Because of the earlier Innskipp rezoning, we were specifically interested to see if RECODE Knoxville would include rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8436)|
| 2:20:45| The presenters were pointedly asked that question, and their answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8445)|
| 2:20:51| The additional work of trying to rezone could not be accomplished by the given deadlines was the reason given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8451)|
| 2:20:59| We left that meeting reassured that there would not be rezoning in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8459)|
| 2:21:08| We did sign up for the email notifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| We got the notifications about the first draft being released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8471)|
| 2:21:17| We were very surprised to discover that, indeed, rezoning was taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8477)|
| 2:21:24| We checked our property and the property next door that are currently both R2 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8484)|
| 2:21:32| They were both rezoned to RN1 or proposed to RN1, single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| Our next-door neighbor is a grandfathered office operating in a house which is next to the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8498)|
| 2:21:47| We face two industrial lots across the street, which are Goddow and Innskipp Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8507)|
| 2:21:57| In addition, the small area plan for Innskipp on Map 5 has the East Innskipp Drive corridor as a mixed-use special district in C11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8517)|
| 2:22:10| We didn't see a reason to change our coding, our zoning at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8530)|
| 2:22:18| I do want to commend whoever put together the website for Recode Knoxville and the staff at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8538)|
| 2:22:28| They have done an excellent job of making it possible to actually research current and proposed zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8548)|
| 2:22:36| With the map tools on that side, I did a survey of our area, an area bounded by Central Avenue Pike on the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8556)|
| 2:22:46| Cedar Lane to the north, and Innskipp Drive on the east and the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8566)|
| 2:22:55| specifically looking for R2 properties that were being changed to R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| I realize that there are some oversights that were made in the first go-around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| but I would suspect there were, I found 52 such properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| I would suspect that that number is probably closer to 45 in that little area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8592)|
| 2:23:20| If that many changes have been proposed in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| we wonder how many are being proposed for everybody else, every other property owner in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8604)|
| 2:23:35| I understand the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| I understand, after having read numerous documents today and in the days past, the amount of work that has gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8617)|
| 2:23:47| But as far as residential is concerned, we really need to just make the parsing of one's code to the code that it corresponds to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8627)|
| 2:23:57| and move on and not do the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| Thank you for your comments, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| Next is Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| Mr. Hill, you know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| I sure do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| I'm Tim Hill, 311 South Wise Garber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| I'll try to keep it short and sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| I think we're doing some great work with this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| Gerald has led this charge in, I think, a very positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| I want to talk, I just want to focus on the commercial aspect of the recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| and hit on two points here that I think are critically important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| One has to do with the equivalency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| I guess it would be the equivalency or the zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| When you look at areas like the downtown edge, there are some of us that spent much time, effort, resources, money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8685)|
| 2:24:56| to get the properties adequately rezoned to C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8696)|
| 2:25:03| If you look around Emory Place, North Gay, Fifth Avenue, and I could go on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8703)|
| 2:25:10| but there are buildings there, they have no ability to have parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8710)|
| 2:25:16| Why in the world would you ever have a C3 zoning on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| What we did was promptly correct what it should have been to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8722)|
| 2:25:28| and sought a C2 rezoning, which requires no parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8728)|
| 2:25:34| What we're seeing now in many of these areas, I can take a whole northern block of Emory Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| and I don't know where you're going to find private parking for those buildings ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| but this would now go into a CG3, but I think there is somewhat of an improvised fix here to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8746)|
| 2:25:55| well, if the building ever comes down, then you need 60% parking. Is that what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8755)|
| 2:26:02| We're still working through that. That would be a new zone, a downtown edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| But here is what I would caution you, and I'm not trying to persuade, I'm trying to inform and forewarn in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8765)|
| 2:26:13| but are we trying to promote the addition of parking in these urban core areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8773)|
| 2:26:20| And I hope the answer would be no, because it's just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| I would have to take away a building to add parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| and I don't think that's what the intent is for this council or this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| The other thing I want to hit on very briefly has to do with C3 is a very widely used zone in the suburbs particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8793)|
| 2:26:45| and I just want to create an illustration, a visual to you folks, council, that it forces the buildings to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8805)|
| 2:26:57| and I want you to visualize, and many of you have heard my examples of these L-shaped retail centers up and down Kingston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| Pike, Bearden, or I could go to Broadway, Chapman Highway, pick your street, but I'm going to take, let's say, a food city in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8824)|
| 2:27:12| It's an L-shaped center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| We'd be required to push that building toward the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| and then we're going to orient the consumer experience to come in the back where the loading docks are, the dumpsters are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8839)|
| 2:27:28| all the other accessory storages that these retailers and grocery users stick out in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8848)|
| 2:27:36| It's quite unsightly, and it's not very user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| So I want you to imagine that experience as a consumer to come from the back to your grocery store or restaurant or retail use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8860)|
| 2:27:51| I just don't think it's very practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| So I would ask you to take a good hard look at that, and also the L in the L center just will not work anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8874)|
| 2:28:02| because you have a rear of one section, and then you would have to have a front of another section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8882)|
| 2:28:09| and it's impractical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| It's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8891)|
| 2:28:12| It's not impractical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| It's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| So I would ask that you please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| All right, and then I'm going to, you know, I would also ask where these CG3s are widely successful in suburban areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8897)|
| 2:28:27| and I know we can point to some place like a planned development, say, North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8907)|
| 2:28:34| There's a small area of that development that would have a building oriented near the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8914)|
| 2:28:41| but if you look at the vast majority of their retail segment at North Shore Town Center, it would be more like the C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8921)|
| 2:28:49| So I would ask you to look very closely at trying to keep a C3 behaving like a C3 instead of a CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8929)|
| 2:28:57| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8937)|
| 2:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| Next is Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8944)|
| 2:29:09| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| Community Forum, first of all, Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8951)|
| 2:29:16| Community Forum has actively participated in the Recode Knoxville process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8956)|
| 2:29:21| Our members have attended many of the public and neighborhood meetings, stakeholders committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| and both of the previous city council workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| We support Recode Knoxville, and our objective is to work with others to improve the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8968)|
| 2:29:35| We have already submitted comprehensive responses to Draft 1 and Draft 2 covering 25 topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8975)|
| 2:29:41| The purpose of these remarks today is to express our concerns about the proposed future timetable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8981)|
| 2:29:47| for consideration by MPC and city council of this 200-plus pages document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| which will significantly affect all 73,000 parcels of property within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8993)|
| 2:29:59| It has been stated that the public and city council have been studying Recode for the past 20 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| and therefore it should go to MPC on November 8 and the city council in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| We disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| It is necessary to state some history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| The agreement with Camaros was approved by city council on December 6, 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9013)|
| 2:30:19| and the contract for $280,250 went into effect around February 1, 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9019)|
| 2:30:26| and the work was to be completed by or before October 31, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9026)|
| 2:30:33| That is where the 20-month figure comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| However, neither the public nor city council began to analyze anything until March 21, 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9036)|
| 2:30:43| when the first draft became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| That is just six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| The second draft, with many revisions, became public on July 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| The maps were first posted on August 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| Community meetings were held in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| The deadline for submitting comments to draft two of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| and draft one of the maps for the entire city is today, September 20, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| And I know we're extending that, and you can always send in a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| But nevertheless, everybody was told when the deadline was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| Draft three is expected to be released in mid-October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| leaving very little time for analysis or debate of public comments to draft two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9078)|
| 2:31:24| There will be little time for analysis or debate of draft three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| before another round of public meetings to discuss it with the public and city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9088)|
| 2:31:33| and before the final draft goes to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9093)|
| 2:31:36| in advance of the artificial deadline of consideration by MPC at the November 8 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9096)|
| 2:31:42| The responsibility for adopting a replacement zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9102)|
| 2:31:46| belongs entirely with city council after receiving a recommendation from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9106)|
| 2:31:52| I do not envy your task to become experts on over 200 pages of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| which will have a great impact in the future on zoning and development in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9117)|
| 2:32:04| This is probably the single largest task for city council in many decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| I urge you to take control of this process immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| and establish a more reasonable timetable for considering recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| I urge you to schedule workshops to examine specific topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9137)|
| 2:32:21| to debate feedback from the community, to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| and to demand explanations as to what the rationale is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| for any change from the existing ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| and understand how changes will impact neighborhoods and individual properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| It makes no sense to try to tackle the entire ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| at one regularly scheduled meeting in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9161)|
| 2:32:44| There can be no doubt that amendments will be offered by city council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| if you haven't provided input before the final draft is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| The public rightfully expects their elected officials to take the time required to get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9172)|
| 2:32:58| to make informed decisions, and to not rush to get it finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| It is not fair to expect the public to understand this entire document, which keeps changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| You have access to city council's attorney to advise you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| as well as employees of the city and MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9191)|
| 2:33:16| You should look at how other similar-sized cities are handling the same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9196)|
| 2:33:22| Ultimately, you must make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9202)|
| 2:33:25| Many are just becoming engaged with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9205)|
| 2:33:28| City council members are also struggling to understand what is being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9208)|
| 2:33:32| and before today have not had a real discussion or debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9212)|
| 2:33:36| Council members must do their own analysis and engage in the public discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9216)|
| 2:33:41| Council should not be required to adopt anybody else's timetable with artificial deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9221)|
| 2:33:47| Community Forum looks forward to working with you to produce a zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| that will have the support of the citizens of Knoxville and of the neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| To achieve that objective, there must be a requirement for transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9236)|
| 2:33:59| and real discussion and debate on very specific topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| Thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| Thank you, Mr. Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| Okay, next is Allie Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| Allie Cohn, C-O-H-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| Please give us your name and address and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9255)|
| 2:34:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9258)|
| 2:34:19| My name is Allie Cohn, and I live at 8313 Cambridge Woods Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| which actually is not in the city district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9264)|
| 2:34:28| Thank you so much for allowing me to speak this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| I moved to Knoxville from out of state just over two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9272)|
| 2:34:35| and I had not even visited before I pulled into the driveway of our Westside rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| Renting a home, sight unseen, is a bit daunting when relocating with a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9280)|
| 2:34:45| but sometimes circumstances necessitate that we depend on others for guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| when we must make big choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| Our relocation was due to my husband's new job at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| and we relied heavily on professors and administrators in his college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| to guide us with the decision of where to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| We were told over and over by many people to live outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9302)|
| 2:35:07| We were told the city is not affordable and that community was better out west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9307)|
| 2:35:12| and that schools were better, which also plays a little bit into the segregation aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9312)|
| 2:35:18| mentioned by Councilmember Cimprez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9318)|
| 2:35:23| So we rented a house out west, enrolled our three children in their respective schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| and began the process of adjusting to a new place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| We quickly realized how much we wished we had made a different choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9330)|
| 2:35:34| However, after such a huge transition for our high schoolers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9334)|
| 2:35:38| we have made the decision to write it out for a few more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9338)|
| 2:35:41| So why am I sharing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| Well, we have spent the last year researching areas of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| that we hope to consider when we relocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| And when I heard about the zoning code update last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| I became very interested in the proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| After looking at the recode maps, I am here to advocate for bringing back the orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9357)|
| 2:36:02| The beauty of this city is its diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| something the West does not offer to nearly the same degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9365)|
| 2:36:08| The result of this downzoning is that options for the development of affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9368)|
| 2:36:13| such as smaller lot single-family homes, duplexes, or multifamily dwellings, are restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9373)|
