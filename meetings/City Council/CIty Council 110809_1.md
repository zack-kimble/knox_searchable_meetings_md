| 2:08:03| of granting unwarranted variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| They need to be able to specify the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| that they're basing their decision on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| It has to be a true hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| There's a list of them in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| They should be able to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| we're basing this decision on this hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| They don't do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| I've been to many BZA meetings and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| well, I think that will look okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| so I'm going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| Appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| This question is for Vice Mayor Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| who sponsored this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| I'm still a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| I'm comfortable in voting for the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| but I'm not comfortable in voting for the 25-foot number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| Is there any flexibility in amending the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| a little bit, something along the lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| of reducing the maximum height of ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| monument signs to less than 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| and then as MPC looks at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| rather than giving a hard and fast number in the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| Well, one of the reasons I didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| well, if you go to 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| you settle it in terms of anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| trying to move forward at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| And I'm hoping that as it goes forward through the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| that they'll come back with some other recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| on how we might accommodate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| folks that are in valleys or might not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| everybody needs the chance to have a sign and be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7766)|
| 2:09:30| So that's the intent of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| is to not take it way up into the sky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| but have, you know, an acceptable height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| So I'm comfortable with the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| And maybe Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| you might tell us how we reach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| And, you know, you know what our intentions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| How best should we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| Should we amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| Should we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| You don't have to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| We will make our recommendations based on best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| And those best practices currently are a trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| towards creating sign districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| within communities with variable heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7806)|
| 2:10:10| related to the functional classification of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| upon which the property is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| the speed limits and factors like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| So we certainly will consider 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| so that you have that option to go to if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| but we'll probably offer a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| Okay, well, based on Mr. Donaldson's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| I can certainly support this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| I just, I didn't want my vote to be construed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| as I was willing to harden fast at 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| Yeah, I think we need a surgical approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| based on ambient conditions and best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| All right, I believe we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| Councilman Greave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| I just wanted to echo what Council Lady Rodley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| had to say in terms of not having a concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| but I do understand what Mr. Donaldson is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| We do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7865)|

| 2:12:34| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| You would come down and give your address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| Thank you, Mayor Brown and distinguished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| citizens here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| Again, I'm David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| I live at 505 Hollywood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| I'm honored to be president of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| Pond Gap Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| and it's an honor to represent my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| Mann Street is within our boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| as well as the Golf Ranch and Sutherland Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| I'm a lifelong resident of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| In fact, my great granddad and grandmother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| came to the community back in the 1900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| In fact, we have some people that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| in the community farther back than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| Back to the 1790s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| In fact, we get our name from the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| that early settlers said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| take your cattle to Pond Gap Pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| So we've been quite busy these last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| 10 or 11 years of our association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| We're very young compared to the length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| of time our neighborhood's been in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| And I've got a nice picture of Mr. Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| Mrs. Roddy, and Mr. Woodhull back in 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| when we dedicated a marker on Tobler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| close to the site of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| first airport on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| And Mayor Brown, I've got a nice picture of him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| when we dedicated the Golf Ranch marker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| on Sutherland near Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| And that was what, two or three years ago, I believe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| So we've been busy trying to preserve our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| Now, Mann Street, we want to at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| preserve part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| The reason being, this, John L. Mann| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| started this street back in 1923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| In the packet I sent to all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| we've got a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| And it's the last of five roads in that part of Pond Gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| that housed our wonderful citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| that either played or witnessed amateur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| baseball games in the 40s and 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| This took place on a field at the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| of Mann Street and Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| And this was a big deal in the 40s and 50s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| because black people and white people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| came together and played in racial harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| We had some teams that were all white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| some all black, some mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| I hope you saw the wonderful article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| in the June 8th News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| My uncle Bill White, who is white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| for a period of time was the bat boy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| for the all black Bearden Tigers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| There's still some Tigers around today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| Walter Keith and Willie Curry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| And it was a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| The black and white teenagers in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| would play ball games there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| We even had some amateur football games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| but predominantly the Bearden Tigers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| and some of the other teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| And there's one year they made six members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| on the All-Star team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| And we think this racial harmony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| this is something that we really need to emphasize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| What I want to emphasize, we're all God's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| And when these UT students come over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| to play their intramural sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| I want them to have at least a portion of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| they drive down and realize we're God's children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| and what this legacy of Mann Street means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| You know, up until 1960, I guess the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| I can put it is, UT had a case of the stupids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| It's the only way I can understand people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| who want to discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| It's stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| If they took the lesson of the 40s and 50s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| Mann Street, I think we could overcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| Unfortunately, the Sentinel had an article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| this past January about some racial problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| last year at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| I would think UT would want to jump on this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| to preserve at least a couple of hundred feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| But I've never seen a final design on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| I'm just going with the design that was in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| last September, the day after the groundbreaking ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| It looks to me like there's enough room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| for two or 300 feet to have this road kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| And we used to have the airport there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| It's gone, we got a marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| We used to have the golf range there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| It's gone, we got a marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| We used to have the drive-in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| It's gone, we got a marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Let's have something you can reach out and touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| As an educator, I can tell you, if you use all the senses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| you can learn things and master things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| I'm going to get out there and walk down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Maybe it's the Cherokee Indian in me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| My great-grandmother was full-blooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| Maybe I've got a little more appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| for the land than other people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| But I think UT and I can come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| And I represent my neighborhood on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| I think we can come together on the compromise on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| And I mentioned this back last year to the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| who turned it over to Mr. Stoner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| And I think we can come to a heading on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| and preserve our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| I mean, this is something so important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| that we need to utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| In your package, you've got a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| from County Mayor Berkshire, who supports us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| a petition with some names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| not only of our neighborhood, but some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| We've got two mayoral candidates that signed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| We've got a map that we got from the Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| We've got a copy of Mr. Van Gilder's article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| in the Beard and Shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| And unfortunately, the new Sentinel article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| about the racial woes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| But like I say, we feel like we can compromise on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| if UT will come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| And I want to mention, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| that they had two postponements at the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| which we didn't object to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| And talking to Tim Rogers last week at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| they have no final design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| In fact, the fire department put a stipulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| in this ordinance that the road would have to stay open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| for six months to handle the demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| And Mr. Stoner said something very interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Quote, yes, we want to close the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| but we'll keep the road surface intact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| for emergency vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| So while people are doing a double take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| I ask, well, let's at least preserve part of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| I could get no one to answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| In fact, Councilman Grieve, bless his heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| back maybe a year ago when talking to some UT officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| said, don't just accept the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| that you're going to propose this street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| to be closed without some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| Sir, you were right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| We opposed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| Anyway, if we could sit down and talk with the UT people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| surely we could come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| to preserve part of this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| And I would finally like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| I want the city to keep this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| as an official city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| And maybe you can hang a left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| to go to the parking area or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| because not that I don't trust UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| but one day they say they're poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| the next day they're rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| One day they're poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| We can't afford this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| We can't renovate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| Let's turn the lights off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| if you leave your office more than 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| Then the next day, 2 million, sorority village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| buying Shelburne Towers, 130 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| for a new student center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| And of course, they're catching grief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| with Kim Trent of Knox Heritage over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| So anyway, if you've got any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| I'd be glad to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| And like I say, I've got some copies here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| of the articles and attachments, everything I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| Thank you for letting me talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| You know, I appreciate David Williams' passion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| on behalf of the Palm Gap community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| in raising the issue and trying to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| the history of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| But on this one, I have to depart in the sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| that to me, the land is there for the living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| And this is not gonna be a regularly traveled road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| by anybody and nobody played some important historic game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| on the road surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| And the city probably doesn't need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| to spend money every year or every several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| to maintain a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| What I read in the packet was that they were gonna find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| some pervious surface that would allow water to penetrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8389)|
| 2:19:54| but it would still have some pavers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| but it would be part of the sort of the modern view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| of how you deal with water flow on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| And the more impervious, the opposite surfaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| that resist downflow make more stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| and flood conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8408)|
| 2:20:09| So I hope David will work very hard with UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8409)|
| 2:20:15| and that UT will work very hard with David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| to come up with some kind of appropriate historical marker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| that recognizes what happened here and the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| and the lessons that can be derived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| as he says, as a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8427)|
| 2:20:28| but whether there's a road there or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| doesn't seem to evoke the great history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| that he's talking about and it has cost implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| And again, I think using land for the living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| is the most appropriate thing we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| We don't wanna tie it up forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| just because something happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| I mean, who hadn't been in a town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| where Washington slept there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| I don't know what that does for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| but at least it was a sign and we didn't save the bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| And I think that we need to be practical about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| I think UT needs to be accommodating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| in trying to get appropriate signage or marking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| to show that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| That is a good learning lesson for the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| and they should be aware of that and of the heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| I would hope that we would not impose a duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| to keep a piece of pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| just because it was related to that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| Houseman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| If we could, could Dr. Stoner come and address us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| in terms of the handouts he's giving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| Is the entrance to the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| where Mann Street is presently, Dr. Stoner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8491)|
| 2:21:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| Ken Stoner, 308 Ginbrook Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| I'm Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| Should I just make a few remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| or do you just want to ask questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8504)|
| 2:21:45| Go ahead, please, ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| I circulated two handouts out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| They shouldn't make it around by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| I appreciate Council's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| and the effort they put in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| With me here this evening is Jeff Maples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| who's a Senior Associate Vice Chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| for Finance Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| Joe Ledford, who's the Senior Architect on the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| and also Ms. Terry Faulkner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| who's Chair of the Bearden Council of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| I know Vice Chancellor Rogers has met individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8529)|
| 2:22:10| with all members of Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| and I certainly appreciate the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| that you've individually and collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| given to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| Closure of Mann Street is critical to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| To maximize the space within a rec sports complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| a road cannot run through the center of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| as this has been clearly communicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| from the inception of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| I'd point out that there's no tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| federal, state, local, in the project at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| Students have been actively pursuing a critical need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| for the last 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| and they tax themselves through a fee increase on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| There's no appropriated monies or tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| in this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| The University wants to be good neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| and we feel that we've made exceptional efforts to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| Since announcing the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| University officials have met and communicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| with four different mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| members of City Council, County Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| merchants, Army Personnels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| administrators of West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8580)|
| 2:23:01| Pond Gap Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8581)|
| 2:23:02| and all the neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| This project has received the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| of the Bearden Council that represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| Sequoia Hills, Kingston Pike, Forest Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| Sutherland Heights, Westview, and Lionsview neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| Documentation of support from these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| with representative signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| was provided to Council earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| As the design has been evolving to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| in accordance with input received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| from neighboring communities and the City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| these are the following accommodations that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| We've added $85,000 to the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| to continue to beautify the streetcape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| along the Sutherland Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| with a matching decorative fence along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| We've agreed to add that same decorative fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| on the back side of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| where the rock garden is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| That added $16,000 to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| We agreed to add some striped sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| that was in the letter of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| last time we met before City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| and that added another $4,500 to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| We've agreed to continue the decades-long practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| of mowing city easements and all the right-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| on completion of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| That practice will resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| as soon as we have the lawn equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| and the equipment back on site to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| and we've done that for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| We increased the parking spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| designated for public parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| for greenway to access by eight spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| The University agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| and you'll see this on the one sketch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| the University agreed to a beautification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| of a landscaping and entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| A rain garden model is among the suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| in the Mann Street area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| This area is highlighted on green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| on the attached sketch now being circulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| This is the same sketch that was passed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| We agreed to locate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| per the suggestions at the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| we were gonna locate a plaque| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| in the gateway entrance that's being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| Research associated with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| in preparation by the Archeological Research Laboratory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| We've asked them to do the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| and the history of this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| Now, the other handout that I passed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| is a sample of what a plaque might read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| that'd be in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| that could be put in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| These are things that we're working on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| The dates would have to be verified and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| We've asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| It'd be some sort of an educational sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| or a sign in that area for people using the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| or access to the guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| It'll be less than 50 feet in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| And at any rate, this is the type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| these are the things that we're working on at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| I must emphasize that this is a draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| because we have to get the verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| of the dates and the times from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| For example, recollections of some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| recall the Barnum and Bailey Circus once performed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| They did perform, but it was to the Northeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| in a place called Mike Underwood's Meadow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| It was not on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| The recollection of the drive-in theater is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| but it is not on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| That was in the Earth Fair Shopping Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| which resides adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| And it's true that there are several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| interracial baseball teams and interracial communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| in the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| One was, this area was called Slady at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| that accessed off Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8757)|
| 2:25:58| There was the Brickyard Community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| which was over in the Homburg area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| And there's also the Lion's View Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8762)|
| 2:26:03| over behind Buddy's Barbecue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| where the Metropolitan Drug Commission is currently located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| It is also true that there was a city-sponsored league| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| called the Atomic League that played| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| at various sites in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| One of which is the open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| where West High School is now located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| Most of the playing so far of what we discovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| is yes, there were ball fields there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| but most of the activities took place on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| where West High School is, not on this particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| But we're researching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| If baseball was played on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| with interracial teams, we want to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| And we will continue to do the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| And this site was used for other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| that are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| We will, for recognition of the history of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| we will certainly include it on the plaque| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| and make an appropriate designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| of the history of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| I believe we've reached the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| Let me recognize Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| You finish, Councilman Grebel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| I just wanted to say, yeah, no, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| I've been working with Dr. Stoner and UT on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| and the things that he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| about what they have added to the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8830)|
| 2:27:14| every time they meet with us has been, well, it's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| I guess is what I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| And that by moving the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| providing additional parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| providing the decorative fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| that's going to go along Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| and then also adding the decorative fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| down near the rock gardens along the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| You know, they've been extremely cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| The one question that I have, Dr. Stoner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| is the portion that goes into the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| is that exactly where Mann Street is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| on the drawing next to the green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| Yes, that is almost exactly where Mann Street is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| I can't say that's it exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| but that's what we're developing right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| Is it possible just to put up a sign that says that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| Well, we've got Mann Street on the historical marker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| We've also recognized-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| Is the historical marker going to be at that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| Yes, it would be at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| You see that, well, the location is offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| from where Mann was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| This would be the kind of the garden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| that we agreed to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8890)|
| 2:28:11| We would put the plaque in there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| And that's where, you know, that's a Mann Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| is just over a little bit to the right of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| adjacent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8898)|
| 2:28:18| And we would recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| We've also recognized that there was a former name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| to the corridor that runs along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| I believe it was called Sprankle Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| rather than the history, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| of the Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| So we've recognized that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| So we're trying to incorporate as much history as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| and we'll get that from the historian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| Have you given David a copy of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8918)|
| 2:28:43| You have now, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| I just finished that up today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| after I got some reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| from the Archaeological Research Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| As I sent you this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| also the design that you had requested, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8937)|
| 2:28:58| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8938)|
| 2:28:58| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| Is this UT property or is this city property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| Mr. Donaldson, is this a University of Tennessee street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8944)|
| 2:29:09| or is this a city-owned street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| It's a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| And the request is to abandon that right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8953)|
| 2:29:17| So it will go to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| which is UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8959)|
| 2:29:20| What we could do on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| we could work with the university officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| with the public property committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| on some sort of a recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| something to commemorate and recognize Mann Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| find the appropriate way to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| as it pertains to what we could do, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| But I applaud the university on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| their effort to put up a placard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| or some sort of recognition of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| But if, Mr. Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| if you don't think that's going far enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| maybe you could put in an application of some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| and we could further recognize some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| I would like to see what they propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| What gets me on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9001)|
| 2:30:02| This is the deal with the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| Wait a minute now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| I mean, we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| if somebody wants to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9006)|
| 2:30:07| I just think that there's the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| we can find the appropriate measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| to recognize Mr. Mann and the former residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| and the activities that went on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| Councilwoman Marotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9020)|
| 2:30:22| Ms. Stoner, as predicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9022)|
| 2:30:23| I have a couple of questions for you if you have a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| On the plan that you gave us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| which is very small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| I need much better glasses than these to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| On the letter of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| with the city and the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| there are going to be two public access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| to the Greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| And just for the public and for my knowledge only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9041)|
| 2:30:45| where are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9045)|
| 2:30:45| One is off Lebanon Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| The existing one on Lebanon Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9049)|
| 2:30:50| would be on the left of the drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| And then the one that goes on the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9051)|
| 2:30:54| that goes around the property to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| That looks like a little path that comes from Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9058)|
| 2:30:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9059)|
| 2:30:59| That's the two accesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| And then is there more than one public access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9060)|
| 2:31:04| into the rec fields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| Or is it just at this green point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| You've talked about the decorative fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| and all of that around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| So if I'm a member of the public or a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| and I want to access these fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9077)|
| 2:31:18| is that green place the only access point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| Just to the right of it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| That'll be the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| That'll be the primary access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9084)|
| 2:31:25| Great, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| Yeah, I echo my colleagues' appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| for the university's enhancements of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| and also the depth and accuracy of your research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| for this plaque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9098)|
| 2:31:39| I think it's very important to all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| that this history be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| My suggestion was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| if there were going to be more than one entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| to the property, that maybe this could be designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| as the Mann Street entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9109)|
| 2:31:50| But since it's the only entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| then that may not fit within the university's plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| But I think this history is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| Knowing that we're all trying to be aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| of everyone who has lived in this country at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| Maybe your archeologist might even go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| to the Native Americans that were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| before the early settlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9129)|
| 2:32:10| I know this is a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| And certainly any time we do excavations for our projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| we find evidence that there were people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| long before the white settlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| And it's certainly important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| to recognize their contributions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| But I applaud this, Dr. Stoner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| I know a lot of work has gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| And a historic plaque like this, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| would go a long way in terms of preserving this heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| And I'm pleased to see Slayerty mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| As you know, I was very much a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| of the renovation of the Lyons View School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9156)|
| 2:32:38| And during a time of segregated education in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| it was an African American school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| that served school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9163)|
| 2:32:44| It's on Lyons View Pike who walked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| from Slayerty Brickyard and Lyons View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| So nice to have that tie-in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| Dr. Stoner, I hate to ask you to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9172)|
| 2:32:56| But that is my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9176)|
| 2:32:58| And I did get an email from the Council of Neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9178)|
| 2:33:03| But you listed a couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| two or three or four neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| And just for clarity, are you saying that all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| that you listed are supporting the closure of Man Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9193)|
| 2:33:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| The chair of the Bearden Council of Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| represents the five of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| And I think their signatures were on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| of the earlier documents that was provided to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| So yes, all of those that were listed in that packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| do support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| All right, just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9213)|
| 2:33:34| Mr. Williams, you started out with the partial sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| what gets me on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| So what gets you on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| First off, Bearden Council does not represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| We've never been invited to any of the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| from day one organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| Mrs. Roddy, bless her heart, a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| emailed me in the morning of some meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| And unfortunately, my schedule was made for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| Correspondence, letters, and phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| to the leadership of Bearden Council have not been returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| The one meeting we went to in Mayor Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| was there last August, concerned a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| of where the ACE hardware is off of Forest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| That we showed up to with a couple of other of our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| and we found out to our dismay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| that the night before the meeting was canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| And this has been a problem with our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| going back to the Forest Heights bridge closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| It seemed like there are those outside of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| that want to put their ideas and plans in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9265)|
| 2:34:28| don't really respect our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| And I've said many times before public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| that I wouldn't go to Westwood Park or Sequoia Hills Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| unless I'm invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9276)|
| 2:34:37| I have too much respect for their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| And that's really what has bothered with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| This idea of the fence, sidewalks, and the mowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| and parking space, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9284)|
| 2:34:45| But we were never told about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| In fact, email correspondence with Mr. Stoner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| back in April was April the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| And we had some concerns about when the demolition would start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| and tying this in with the school traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| Well, April 4th was when the application was filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| before the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| Not a word about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| In fact, since last September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| we were not notified in advance on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9307)|
| 2:35:10| I had to go and find out about the demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| who to contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9313)|
| 2:35:13| Now before that, high marks to UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9313)|
| 2:35:17| because we were notified in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| before a public announcement was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| But as far as setting down and talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9320)|
| 2:35:23| showing our concerns and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| and like I said, good research on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| but we've got people that live this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| like I mentioned my uncle and other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9328)|
| 2:35:30| the Kelsos, boat rides, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| And that's what's got us concerned on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| We're here, this is a building community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| we have no say about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| And like I said, if you go west or east or north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| of this complex, you're still in Pond Gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| I can see the people in Sequoia Gardens concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9346)|
| 2:35:49| By the way, we don't necessarily object to the sports fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| we pray they'll be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| But we've got concerns about noise and lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9353)|
| 2:35:56| which I've been assured by UT, they're gonna take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| But the fact of it is, the Sequoia Hills Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| opposed the dairy farm site across the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| for those very same reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| So I keep, have people outside of me tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| how good this is gonna be, and I pray it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| But here we've got an organization that opposed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| Like I said, we don't, we're trying to do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| I cannot understand why just a portion of this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| could be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9380)|
| 2:36:21| We've got Fort Dickerson Road up to Fort Dixon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| those people are dead, the Civil War's over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| but we've got that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| We've got part of the Appian Way in Italy still out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| the Roman soldiers are gone, the Roman government's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| And I think, like I said, when you drive down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| to be a small portion, that's all we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| But it looks like we won't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| Anyway, thank you for getting off my chest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9398)|
| 2:36:42| All right, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| All right, we have a motion, but we do not have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9411)|
| 2:36:52| Been moved and properly seconded, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| 12E is in ordinance approving the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| of JHS Limited Partnership for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| from Light Industrial to General Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9424)|
| 2:37:06| for property located on the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| of Western Avenue, west of Menders Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| Yes, very briefly, that's the Shod property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9432)|
| 2:37:14| off of Western Avenue, I've been by there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9434)|
| 2:37:16| I've talked to the representative, the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| Mainly it's to take some warehouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| and a former lumber yard, and they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| to rezone it commercial, and I think it fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| with the neighborhood, so I'd move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| All right, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| Thank you, I echo Councilman Thomas's sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| The development of this area and some of the retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| that will be coming in is a huge boost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9456)|
| 2:37:40| for the West Haven, Westview, Lonsdale neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| that can use that as a retail trade center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| Been moved and properly seconded, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110809?start=9470)|
