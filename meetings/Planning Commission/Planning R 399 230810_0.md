| 0:09:48| I'd like to make a motion to table item 15, 16, 18, and 19, given the fact that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=588)|

| 0:13:36| We would like to revoke item 30, Spring Lake Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=816)|
| 0:13:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Any other requests from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| My name is Alan Rawls here on behalf of Lowe, Yeager, and Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| and I wanted to address item 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| Item 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=841)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Chairman, I would like to weigh in on that request to remove that one from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| If the reason to remove that one is procedural, staff's recommendation is to pull items 38 through 43| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=875)|
| 0:14:45| because all of those plats were submitted and taken in in a similar fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=885)|
| 0:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| So taking that into consideration, we will then remove in addition to 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, and 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=896)|
| 0:15:11| 40 is postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Let's keep adding the list, and then I'll recap about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I would like to remove item 12 from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| Any other items to be removed from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| So let me recap here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Cheryl will entertain a motion to approve a consent list with the exception of 12, 30, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, and 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=955)|
| 0:16:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| We have a motion to approve the consent list, accepting those that were referred to by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=974)|
| 0:16:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| We'll begin with item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=993)|
| 0:16:47| This is a level two certificate of appropriateness for 11 additional acres of disturbance in the hillside protection overlay at Zero Central Avenue Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1007)|
| 0:17:01| Staff recommendation is to approve the applicant's level two COA request to develop within the HP Hillside Protection Overlay Zoning District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1021)|
| 0:17:12| on the condition that disturbance within the HP overlay not exceed 5.23 acres outside the Tennessee Valley Authority utility easement on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1032)|
| 0:17:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| The applicant is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| I also have in the audience with me who could answer questions about this project, its viability with the staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| Chris Sharp and Stephan Klar from Turner Homes and Urban Engineering in reverse order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| I feel a bit like I'm a canary in the coal mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| This is the first time this issue has ever come before the board, and it's come before this body in I think is a novel way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1075)|
| 0:18:06| And I'm also in the, I guess, the difficult position where I have to respectfully disagree with staff's interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| although I do appreciate them trying to think creatively for a way to grant a level two for 5.23 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| but it's not for the 11 acres that we need to move forward with the concept plan that we are advancing before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1103)|
| 0:18:33| I want to address a couple of comments made at Tuesday's agenda review, and this application is an attempt to game the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1113)|
| 0:18:43| We have an option to purchase this property, all 32 acres of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| although a little over 14 acres is restrained by the TVA easement, which has been completely disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1129)|
| 0:19:00| Going back as far as 1953, the aerials is when TVA actually did the disturbance on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| so it's been disturbed for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| In fact, if you kind of go through the aerials, you'll look at 1959,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| you can see there's some old logging roads on the ridge top there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| and so at least at some point, I'd say probably multiple times in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| the vegetation on this has been disturbed and removed for logging purposes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| So this entire property has been disturbed in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| When Mr. Sharp moved forward with his concept plan, he looked at the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1170)|
| 0:19:39| and he believed that he could do the 11 acres because it was within the disturbance allowance of the 14.17 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1179)|
| 0:19:49| which is what I believe the disturbance allowance would have allowed under 8.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| He specifically looked at 8.9.4, which is the exception, one of the four exceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1195)|
| 0:20:04| but the exception that we're talking about today in the hillside protection portion of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| where it says lots that have been previously legally disturbed or developed would also be accepted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| provided that any new slash additional disturbance does not exceed the previously disturbed area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| or the maximum land disturbance permitted by Table 8.6 below, whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| And Mr. Sharp's opinion was at that time that the plain language would allow him up to 14.17 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| because that was the greater amount of the two numbers, what was previously disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| or what the slope analysis actually yielded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| And so he moved forward with the concept plan and then had some conversations with planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| They disagreed with that interpretation, which is why he asked for a Level 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| but with the proviso that we are not waiving our assertion that it is actually exempt and asking for it to be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1256)|
| 0:21:05| I think, in essence, if you were to follow staff's interpretation on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| which is they say that the previously legally disturbed area within the HP overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| is part of the maximum land disturbance budget, not from it, that exemption 4 doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| It just means you follow the table, and if the table doesn't work, then you have to get a Level 2 COA analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| I have not, and I've thought about this a lot over the past 60 days I've been involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| I've not thought of an example where any other result could come into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| if you're following staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| But what we have before us is a bit of a hen's tooth, it's a little unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| in that this exemption would only apply, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| if you're dealing with disturbance that occurred before the HP overlay was ever in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| or you're dealing with disturbance of an exempt entity like the TV being a quasi-governmental federal agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1317)|
| 0:22:06| They could disturb it even after the HP overlay was in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| Because at that point, once you have a piece of property and you apply the tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| you can't legally disturb it beyond the slope analysis unless there was some prior legal disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| and that can only happen before the HP overlay was in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| or if somebody can come in and not be subject to the zoning ordinance altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| So it is a bit of a unique circumstance that only applies to certain situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| like we have here, we have both of those situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| but I don't think it's something that's going to happen very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| because 99% of the time SAF's interpretation and our interpretation there are advancing would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| And there was also some conversation on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| and just give me just a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| that this could be developed in phases and try to circumvent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| I don't believe that would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| I think if that were to occur, it would be treated like PR density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| Once you get density on a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| you can't then subdivide the property and try to develop it in a separate development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| and get more density because of the density applied to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| You'd say, no, you can't transfer the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| and I don't think you can transfer the slope disturbance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| So it's a very unique circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| We'd ask that you respectfully allow the 11 acres that we're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you, Councilor Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Do we have any opposition in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| In addition, I will say I'd like to hear some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| because this is a little bit complicated here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| and I've spent quite a time looking at it, and it's a good time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Yeah, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| I don't know if this will correlate or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| but does staff use the overall property in order to calculate the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1433)|
| 0:24:02| that is allowed on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| even though that TBA easement is not buildable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| So I'm trying to figure out if you allow the density per the whole property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| even though it's encumbered by a non-buildable area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| why would there be a different analysis on the slope protection maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| I don't know if that correlates or not, but just a logical question maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Logical question maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| Well, in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| the disturbance budget of 14.17 acres equates to what was already disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| and is unbuildable because of the TBA easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| The Planning Commission has the authority to review on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| a Level 2 Certificate of Appropriateness for the hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| where you can take practical considerations like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| and consider an alternative or a variance from 8.9, the disturbance budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| What we proposed was looking at just the buildable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| and conducting a separate slope analysis for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| which does allow for some disturbance but not the entirety of the whole parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| So if I understand, you basically set aside the TVA piece as a separate parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| when you analyzed the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Initially, no, but because of the development plan that was put forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| and the disturbance exceeding that original disturbance budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| this comes before you so that you can consider alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| either a denial, approval, or an approval with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| And what we're recommending is an approval with a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| that it adhered to this alternative slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| I was going to ask Ms. Blakely if you had looked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| I know that discussion came up on the agenda review from Chairman Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| about your opinion regarding the legal aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| I have, and thank you for asking, Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| So this is one that I think the staff's interpretation was correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| in terms of how they reviewed the application of the exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| I do think that that was an appropriate mechanism, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| to look at this particular property, which you were called upon to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| As you look at an application like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| the guidelines say that you're supposed to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| in relation to all of the applicable standards of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| and the evaluation should be based on the particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| and the particular manner proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| And so I think that's what the staff did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| and did very effectively within the confines of this exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| to allow what would otherwise perhaps be not buildable or not usable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| because of the hillside protection in conjunction with the easement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| So in my view, it was an appropriate way to give some opportunity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| in light of what they are dealing with with the building constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| So this is a question for Ms. Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Did you actually run it with the whole 31-plus acres and rerun it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| I mean, what did that calculation show if you were to include the extra acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| So for the entire parcel, the disturbance budget was about 14 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| and that equated to what had already been disturbed by the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| and was unbuildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| So the alternative slope analysis only considers what's buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| So in essence, then, they wouldn't really be able to build anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| had you considered the unbuildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| Yeah, and that's a little bit of a challenge because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| if we cut it back, and I respect and understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| the opinions, you know, about reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| But if we cut it back all the way, my concern is that the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| will not move forward at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| I mean, just from the pure economics of it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| if you literally take half of the subdivision away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| my concern would be there is no subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| And as badly as we need housing right now, that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| I'd like to make a motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| We've got a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Commissioner Schelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| seconded by Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1756)|

| 0:29:21| I'm kind of being very deliberately slow on this one because it's a difficult one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| All right, seeing no other discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Give me a show of the noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| We've got three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1778)|
| 0:29:52| Got it, Ms. Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| On to item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1797)|
| 0:30:05| Applicant, Damon Falconeer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Location, north side of Chickamauga Avenue, west of Mettler Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| east of Coram Street, .67 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| Present zoning is RN2, infill housing overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| Zoning requested is RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| Requesting land use, single family residential, agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| slash forestry, slash vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Staff recommendation, approve the RN3 district because it is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| with the sector plan and development would be reviewed for compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| The infill housing overlay would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| I'm Damon Falconeer, an architect whose address is 4622 Chambliss Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| I'm representing the property owner who owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| who would like to design infill housing that conforms to all the infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Mr. Falconeer, just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| I just want to see if there's any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Do we have any opposition out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| We've got two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| The owner wishes, I'm sorry, we would like to design an infill housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| that conforms to all infill housing overlay district requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| for the empty lot located at 2237 Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| The owner wishes to invest well over a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| in this historic neighborhood by designing and building infill housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| that would be a great example of how infill housing should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| Based on the multi-layer review process that is designed to control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| how this housing looks and functions within the fabric of the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| This multi-family housing will help revitalize some of the affordable housing shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| in Knoxville by creating seven townhouses within the RN3 requested zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| We have reviewed the multi-family housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| and to respect the existing horizontal siding type, shade trees, roof materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| and pitches has set forth in design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| In addition, the new parking and driveway will be designed with pervious paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| to accommodate the appropriateness of the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| even though this property does not technically fall in the hillside protection zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| Since this property is in the IH overlay, infill housing city overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| the design of the housing will be carefully reviewed by the design review board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| in public meetings before a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| will be granted to the owner to construct the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| At the last planning commission meeting, we were asked by one of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| if RN3 zoning would be considerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| We considered that as we met, and then we went ahead and met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| with the planning commission staff, both Ms. Jessica and Ms. Lindsay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| and discussed the commissioner's ideas to reconsider the zoning request to RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| Together with staff's input, we redesigned the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| to conform to the RN3 regulations and infill housing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| We then contacted the Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| President, Michelle Ivester, who's here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| and asked if we could meet to discuss the revised site plan at a convenient time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| and place where anyone could attend and voice their opinion of our new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2017)|
| 0:33:45| After the August 1st meeting was publicized by the president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| two adjacent neighbors attended, one neighbor down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| and the president and her husband, who live at 1131 Chickamauga Avenue, also attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| Only five people attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| At this meeting, the attendees discussed their desire for a single-family house on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| and they were kind of split whether they would even allow a duplex or triplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| as a special exception to the RN zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| The area was designated as an infill housing city overlay district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| by the Recode Knoxville Planning, and the intent is to foster well-designed infill multifamily housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2061)|
| 0:34:29| that will be controlled by strict design guidelines that are now in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| and to encourage neighborhood participation in the next design steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| As an architect for this housing, I want it to be designed very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| with neighborhood participation and be a great example of how infill housing architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| will be designed and work well within the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| and be able to meet the minimum design guidelines of the infill housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| and other property owners' opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| and the HOA around the city will be able to point to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| to see how it can be done appropriately and correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| If a single-family house or multiple single-family houses were built on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| there would be no strict guidelines to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| In my opinion, the RN zoning meets the desires of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| since it's part of the infill housing city housing overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| allow for neighborhood participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| We put together a site plan that you have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| that visually represents our proposed building locations on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| in compliance with the RN zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| This neighborhood has many houses in need of repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| and would benefit from a project of this financial magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| to encourage the continued repair and upkeep of the houses of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| I spoke with a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| He's willing and planning to join the association when he comes to Knoxville in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| The staff of the Planning Commission has expressed support for the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| based on their report that each of you have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| Recode Knoxville has established this area as a TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| traditional neighborhood residential, in the Center City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| and commits consideration of the requested RN zoning, RN3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| This RN3 zoning request is consistent with the general development plan policy 8.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| and I'm confident the Planning Commission will understand our request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| and vote in favor of this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| seeing this opportunity to help meet the existing need for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| in an appropriate way and consistent with the policies and practices that have been set in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you for serving on the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| and thank you for considering this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Do we have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| I thought we had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| What's this one right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2217)|
| 0:37:06| Michelle Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2226)|
| 0:37:15| And then we also have Mr. Matt Morlock that will speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Michelle Ivester, Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| I'm the president of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| and I'm here once again to advocate for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Many of our neighbors wanted to be here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| and unfortunately weren't able to due to their work schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| That's another reason why they weren't able to make the meeting that we set up with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| It was on a weekday night, and a lot of people had to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| Since my time on the OPNA board, I've been to a few thousand meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| Lord, Recone alone was hundreds it seemed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| and I'll continue to attend and advocate for my community, as I'm sure you all would do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| Respectful, responsible development is the goal, as God's not making any more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| Since we last came before this body, we met briefly with the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| who has since changed his request for rezoning from R and 4 to R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| However, this just seems to be an attempt to circumnavigate the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| If the zoning request goes through, he'll then have to ask for a special use request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| for the townhouses he's wanting to build, which basically takes it back to R and 4 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| As you can see, both city and county maps, zoning maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| all of the current zoning within the one- to two-block radius is low-density, single-family residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| and it shouldn't be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| The neighborhood has had many assurances that other apartment buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| such as the one that was put in in the 90s, would not be able to be built today, and yet here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| We'd love to compromise with the owner and even support a duplex or triplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| which would fit with the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| As I mentioned previously, OPNA is aware well of the current housing situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| and if this proposal were designated on one of our busy corridors that encompasses our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| we'd most likely be supportive, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| The missing middle housing option seems to be the go-to phrase for developers these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| but unless the rents are something that the working class can afford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| then it's just words used to manipulate the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| The proposed townhouses won't be aimed at the working class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| and we've been told that the owner won't accept any type of voucher or assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| for people to live there, so the missing middle excuse is debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| I would also point out that this property was a fairly recent acquisition from Mr. Nathan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| He purchased it in November of 2021 and then transferred it to his corporation in August of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| It would seem that there was no due diligence of the property zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| or any consideration of the neighborhood as a whole, and that is an oversight on his part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2381)|
| 0:39:51| However, the neighborhood shouldn't be penalized for his lack of proper research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Poor planning or lack thereof or self-created hardship should not be considered as a valid reason for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| especially in an established older residential neighborhood such as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| If the rezoning is allowed, as I've been recently told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| the developer would be allowed to put in whatever he wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| with little to no recourse to oppose it other than the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| In preparation for this meeting, I came across the 2023 Tennessee Commissioner's Report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| Land Use in Tennessee Striking a Balance, listed on the Tennessee.gov website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| The commission concluded that the zoning proved an effective way for entire communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| to protect the character and quality of life of its neighborhoods and to protect the property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| and that's what we're asking here tonight, or today, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| I'm used to coming at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Please deny this request to help us protect the character and property values of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| Mr. Hill, I did receive your flyer yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| and I was very happy to read that you've dedicated your career to preserving our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| and I hope that you'll help to vote to preserve ours today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Mr. Matt Moorlach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| If I could ask you and others that will be speaking at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| if you'll please be aware of pulling the mic up close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| We can hear you up here, but apparently we're getting some comments in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| There's one thing I know how to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| It's talking to a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Don't worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I had all these words prepared, but I'm not going to say them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| I'm looking at the map that you all have pulled up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| and I want to note something that hasn't really been noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| The R and 5 that's adjacent to the property in question is also owned by the same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| With that in mind, is it okay to bring up a street view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| Who's on the computer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Can we look at a street view of what those properties as a whole parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| which is ultimately what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| If we can bring up a street view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Off to the right, you'll see the dumpster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| It's lovely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| That's my house right there, so back it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| Let's go back to the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| The R and 5 that's right there got snuck in before people gave a crap about our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2532)|
| 0:42:22| To the left, that's six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| That little strip of grass is where the owner wants to build seven more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| I wanted you to have a visual on what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| It's nice to look at the zoning map and the drawings that you have that Mr. Falconier brought you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2556)|
| 0:42:44| I have no doubt that Damon, Mr. Falconier, will build something beautiful like he told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| He's a good architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| It's going to look nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| It's going to be a hell of a lot nicer looking than the apartments that were already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| Our only concern is with the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| I don't think that you could responsibly ever squeeze seven buildings onto a strip of grass that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| I think he's going to build something nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| I think it will look really cool, but there isn't street side parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| That little parking lot for the six units fills up every night as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| Seven more units in there, I can't imagine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| That's my only real harm with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| We're not anti-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| We want it to be smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| I want to also say, under R and 2 with special use, he can totally build a triplex, something that fits onto the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2608)|
| 0:43:37| I had something a lot more eloquent to say with jokes and everything, but I'm tired and I know you want to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| I'm just asking you to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Let's keep it at R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| The Neighborhood Association is happy with the special use to let it be a little more dense than an R and 2 is allowed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| I know it's going to look good because he is a good architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| We'll find compromise and nobody will be fully satisfied on the other end of it because that's what compromise looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2638)|
| 0:44:07| Got to meet somewhere in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| I think that's a good middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Thanks for your time and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| Vice Chair Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| First of all, I would like to commend the applicant and the community for continuing to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2666)|
| 0:44:35| It was obvious that we were looking at something last month that was probably more than should have been submitted to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2675)|
| 0:44:45| The applicant probably was not fully aware of how to attack this need, which is the infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2685)|
| 0:44:55| Again, I applaud the extra work to try to bring back something to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| Something that makes me feel a little better about this that staff brought up on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| is that there are still several layers of approvals that would have to happen as we go forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| This wouldn't just be approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| There would be several hoops to have to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| Because it's consistent with the sector plan and because of that extra review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| I think I'm going to make a motion that we approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| We've got a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Huber to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| We have more lights on, so let's go to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| I would like to ask someone from staff to walk us through the future approval processes that they're going to have to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2744)|
| 0:45:54| Because with townhouses being a special use, I know that that, I believe, comes back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| and also requires a site plan and some other information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| And then there's also the infill review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| So if someone from staff could speak to how involved those processes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| and then what the controls by the boards that would be reviewing those would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| So as Lindsay described at the gender review, the infill housing process review would occur first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| And I can let her speak to what that process would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| And I'll say we don't have a set requirement that the DRB, the Design Review Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| approval precede the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| But typically we would recommend that so that what the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| and the community reviews, again, has already been vetted on the design side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| But an applicant is obligated to submit a site plan and elevation drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| We have a staff pre-review process, so we review the site plan with city codes, zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| and engineering staff to ensure that it meets the relevant codes, identify any issues that they run into in permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| We take a quick look at the principal use standards for if they were townhouses or duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| whatever form of house it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| And then we provide a staff report of how it meets the infill housing design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| The Design Review Board would then review and approve, approve with conditions, or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| There's a 14-day appeal period, and that would be the infill housing process side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| And then during the special use process, we would ask for similar documents, site plan elevations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| circulation, off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| We have an interagency review where we review the site plan with engineering and other relevant departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2867)|
| 0:47:56| And we are reviewing it for compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| consistency with adopted plans, considering potential negative impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| And that goes before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| We post signs in advance of the planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| so there is community input in the special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| And in that process, if, say, there was feedback about dumpster locations or the stepping of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2901)|
| 0:48:33| and I know that the dumpster mentioned is on an adjacent property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| but maybe the developer could combine those and kind of offer something, some form of relief to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2916)|
| 0:48:48| But if there were comments about that, would that come up in the DRB approval process of those layouts and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2928)|
| 0:48:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| And I would also note, just to follow up on Jesse's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| the Design Review Board is also open to the public and has a public input opportunity there, and we post a sign as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2941)|
| 0:49:09| Well, with that, I would say to the developer, however this proceeds, however you all proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| I would recommend trying to have a workshop with DRB as early as possible in the design process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2955)|
| 0:49:24| and try to get the feedback on layouts and whatnot and then also design from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| But that's, and I believe that this project specifically does, you know, with all of these different steps to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2972)|
| 0:49:43| There's a lot of opportunities for improvements and feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| So I think it's a great approach, and we'll be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| I, too, would like to commend both sides for getting together and just trying to talk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| I mean, this stuff is challenging at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Everybody wants to keep the integrity of the neighborhood while still serving all the people that are moving to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3007)|
| 0:50:16| as well as working with staff in revising the application down from RN-4 to RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| I think that was a big step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| But I did have a chance to drive out there, too, and look at the site distances and the hills and the vertical curves, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| You know, Atlantic, I think one of the comments, the public comments, was that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| Atlantic has been recently approved with sidewalks and things like that, but Chickamauga has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| But I think that's a, you know, kind of a normal appreciation through time that happens on these city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3043)|
| 0:50:51| You know, we'd love to have every street with a sidewalk, and hopefully eventually it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| But it might take a little while, but hopefully they'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| But, you know, the opportunity here in looking at the site plan, and I know this isn't exactly what's in front of us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| but I think some of the things we talked about last month were actually incorporated in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| From a design standpoint, I'm pretty impressed, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| I think Commissioner Higgins had mentioned, you know, they're not all side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| They're stacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| So from the road, you'll see three, not seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| The parking is behind an existing single-family home, so it's not all right up against Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3085)|
| 0:51:33| So I think a lot of the feel will stay while still, you know, helping, you know, meet our need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| Plus there's pervious pavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| I mean, I haven't seen anybody do that type of thing for stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| I think it's a good step in the right direction, and obviously I'm supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| I'll reiterate everyone else's feedback on being pleased that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| and the applicant got together and talked and tried to improve things a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| A few things have still hung with me that the opposition said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| I think the quote was, God's not making any more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| I would say that there's not new historic neighborhoods being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| We have several historic first neighborhoods in Knoxville, and we're really fortunate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| We haven't always been the best stewards of those for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| So here is one of those neighborhoods in front of us, and I think when you look at this view on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| there's an orange block there that stands out from everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3165)|
| 0:52:53| I don't think we'd even be considering this application today if that orange block wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| So I'm calling that out because that is how development tends to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| is that we'll look for, oh, there's an RN5 or there's this particular zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| and we're going to bloom from that to add to that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| And that's what's going on here, even though that doesn't match anything else in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| I'm impressed that the neighborhood has said we're not against putting something here like a duplex or a triplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3203)|
| 0:53:32| We're just worried about the density here, and that they're seeing that a duplex or a triplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| could fit into that property in a way that would really feel very genuine to that street as it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| And I think that is my biggest issue with the plan that's in front of us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| that we are not only looking at quite a different plan with density, but we're changing the base zone for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3230)|
| 0:53:59| even when the RN2 would accommodate something else that is in the much-heralded middle-missing category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| So I will not be supporting this and wish that we could retain the RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3247)|
| 0:54:17| Commissioner Schilso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| A few questions for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| So RN2 does not allow any sort of multifamily more than a duplex, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3263)|
| 0:54:30| RN3 is the only form that could have more than a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| There could not be a triplex, correct, on RN2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| A triplex would be considered multifamily, and that's not permitted in RN2 or RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| So we keep mentioning a triplex, but that's not really an option in RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| So I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| I don't know about this site plan, but RN3, there are calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| I guess, has the applicant made sure this many units can fit on this size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| You know, RN3 is just one zone away from RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| You know, that orange dot on there is not, even if it were RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| the orange, I think, makes it look a lot different than what it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| It's just one zone different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| So, you know, I think the fact that they have an infill overlay really is the reason I support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| in terms of being something that can fit in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| If this did not have an infill overlay, I could see how this could be much more out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| We wouldn't have those protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| So I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| Ms. Hillman, if that orange block was not there, how would you all have viewed this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3356)|
| 0:56:08| Proximity of multifamily development is a consideration, but it's not the sole focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| The fact that there are these multiple layers of review to ensure compatibility with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| is probably the most critical piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Also, the number of residential amenities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Although it doesn't have sidewalks, it does have transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| which is due to continue through the new CAT plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| There's recreational amenities, educational amenities, a commercial node not far to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| Those were major considerations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| So are you confident that you would have the same recommendation regardless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| In addition, it's supported by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Where did we leave off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| Is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| First, staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| We've got two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3444)|
| 0:57:32| Agenda item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Applicant Don Horton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Location, west side of Sanders Lane, north of Fuller Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| Approximate size of track, 17,027 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| Present zoning, RN2, hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| Zoning requested, RN4, hillside protection and existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Staff recommendation is to approve the RN3 district because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3479)|
| 0:58:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Location, 2100 Fairmont Boulevard, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| Yes, we're requesting an RN4 zoning for the following reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| Mr. Horton, if you'll excuse me for one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Seeing no opposition, please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| The city has been building housing, energy-efficient housing in low-income neighborhoods as infill housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3514)|
| 0:58:42| and they have the opportunity with property they own on Sanders Lane to build five townhouse units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3522)|
| 0:58:49| And we're wanting to have five townhouse units because feasibility, the cost of the development, five townhouses make it work cost-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3529)|
| 0:59:03| So we approached this and looked at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| It's adjacent to an RN6 on the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| It is a very difficult site, hilltop protection, and a very steep site in parts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3553)|
| 0:59:22| So looking at this, no more than five units could be put on this site economically or feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3562)|
| 0:59:36| So for that reason that we would like to have five units on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| and the RN4 designation allows us to do this within the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3581)|
| 0:59:50| Going to an RN3 would probably not allow the project to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3590)|
| 1:00:01| So that's our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3604)|
| 1:00:12| We have some others signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| Mr. Stan Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| How are you guys doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| My name is Stan Johnson, 1617 Dandridge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| I work for a company called Seed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| We train inner-city youth on green technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| We build solar homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| We've done it in low-income communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| And we're trying to address this missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| If you look right next to it, it's an RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| So we're not asking for anything that massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| We want to do a five unit for low-income community members so we can address this missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| Again, there's no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I talked to Frank Johnson that lives ñ told me not to give you all his address because he lives in the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| But he said this would do a lot for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| So we want to make sure that we are doing what's right for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| We also want to protect the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| We believe in, again, green technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| We want to make sure all this stuff is correct and honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| We also are working with Trinity Foundation to make this thing happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| So there's a lot of partners going into this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| We really want to see it move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| And, again, there's nothing but trees around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| The community needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| We want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| And I think this will be great for our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| And our young people are going to be trained in this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| So we can actually help the community in both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| How about Wendy Glass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| We're not speaking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| In the wrong place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| I make a motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| Everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| Everyone is just seconding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| So we've got Commissioner Barger with a motion to approve per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| The recommendation is for R and 3, not R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| A question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| When was that right-of-way road closed that goes north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| I believe it was closed when the property on the north was splatted as part of the KCDC development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Around 2017 it was splatted, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| I would support R and 4 on this if this motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3762)|
| 1:02:51| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| I really have heard great things about SEEDS and the work that they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| and it got a little mesmerized and excited while they were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| and wasn't realizing the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| And I, too, would support their request over the recommendation if this motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| I guess my question is for staff, what is the biggest problem with not doing R and 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3799)|
| 1:03:28| I think that R and 3 will be more consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| It will allow up to two duplexes will be compatible with the two duplexes to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| and it will allow up to four townhouses, and it will require a special use review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| so the commission will be able to see that it is compatible in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| and scale with the surrounding single-family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| The R and 6 zoned parcel to the west, it's a hilly forested area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| and according to the KCDC's master plan, this will remain undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| So if it had more development to the area, I think we would consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3840)|
| 1:04:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| I think I could support R and 4 here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Just to add to my reasoning for R and 4, if I understand correctly, R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3859)|
| 1:04:27| like we just discussed a minute ago, would require special use for townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| R and 4 would not for townhouses but would for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Within, depending on the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| The number of units, yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| And then it's also in hilltop protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| What process would they have to go through for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3888)|
| 1:04:57| With regards to the hillside protection overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| Yes, on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| They would request a certificate of appropriateness based on the grading plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| and the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| Is there more that goes into that based off the density or the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3909)|
| 1:05:18| or the use, depending on those factors, more or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| We look at the disturbance allowance and make sure that the grading plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| stays within that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| My point is just that I think that there's, similar to what we just discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3932)|
| 1:05:40| there are other controls that would help make sure that this would stay within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| the scale of the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| I think that if they wanted to, with R and 4, come back with a big multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| they would have to go through special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| I think that in this case, more steps don't seem necessary unless they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| trying to take that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| And then also being next to, as mentioned, the R and 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| I think that R and 4 just does seem more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| I, too, have a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| On the lot, with respect to the lot next door with the two duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| and correct me, how many square feet is required in R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| What's the minimum square footage required for a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Yeah, and that was my recollection as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| And the only reason I bring it up is if you scale that off on KGIS anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| I certainly don't have a survey in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| but it looks to be about 14,000 square feet on that with two duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| So it might be nonconforming, but my point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| being compatible with a higher zone, it's already built out to a higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| kind of a situation than what R and 2 would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| So just kind of trying to, I guess, make a point that I'd be comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| with R4 as well, R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Just to clarify, the minimum lot area for a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| Oh, I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| There's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Right, there's two duplexes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| Commissioner Barger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| I'd like to change my motion to accept R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Commissioner Levinson, would you accommodate a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| Oh, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| For the same rationale that I was an advocate for keeping R and 2 in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| previous case that we discussed, that's my thinking here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| So I'm sorry that you changed your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| But the R and 3, by changing it to R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| it seems like we're increasing that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| with the thinking of the applicant that we're talking about right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| and not thinking about the land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| that it is not just the person that's in front of us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| but we're changing the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| So I am absolutely in favor of what SEED is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| and the staff recommendation that came through for R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| I'll be casting a vote against this motion because of the R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| I just want to clarify that, but totally in favor of the R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| So we have a revised motion to, per the applicant's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4124)|
| 1:08:53| with Commissioner Barger, R and 4, seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| So all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4144)|
| 1:09:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| On to item number 12, applicant R. Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Location, north side of Douglas Avenue, west of Calloway Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| Size of track, 3,071 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| Zoning R and 2, existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| Proposed use, two-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| The staff recommendation is to approve the request for a two-family dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| in the R and 2 zoning district subject to the two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Seeing no opposition, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Well, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| I'm here with something that was previously on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| It's non-controversial and it's been pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| So I'd like to defer my time to listen to the objection of Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4217)|
| 1:10:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| On to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| So I pulled this off consent because I felt like it was warranted more discussion amongst the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| and I feel like that's our opportunity and my ability to do being on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4237)|
| 1:10:45| This application was unique to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| I mean, I've only been on commission two years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| but I was interested to see that it first went through BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| got approval for a significant, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| a significant number of variances before coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| And, you know, I'd encourage Director Brooks to talk more about this process if she would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4265)|
| 1:11:17| But I am opposing this special use, and I want everyone to consider this is a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| It's not a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| And my understanding is when it goes before BZA, they are approving variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| They're not looking at the use when they approve these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| In an RN2 zone, which this is, the guidelines, the development guidelines for that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4298)|
| 1:11:48| are going to be not as stringent as it would be if it was a duplex on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4308)|
| 1:11:56| In fact, two of the variances, number one was a reduction of the front setback from 20 feet to 3 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4316)|
| 1:12:04| It says in the zoning code that in cases of two as a duplex, in no case should it be less than 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4324)|
| 1:12:14| And in the variance number seven, it says reduction of minimum lot area required for a dwelling two family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| from 10,000 square feet to 30,000, 3,071.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| For RN2, for a single family, it's only 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| So when it went before BZA, it had not received a special use yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| so I'm assuming they're considering it for an RN2 without a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| That would only be a variance from 5,000 to 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| Now we're looking at a variance from 10,000 to 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Feel free to pipe in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| But, you know, when looking at a special use for a duplex on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| there are specifications on development guidelines which prevent that from being more of a use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| more of an intensive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| And in this case, because these variances have already been granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| because this is such a very small 3,000 square foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| that use of having two families on this piece of property is going to be much more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| and, in my opinion, is inappropriate for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| So I will be voting no for this special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| Commissioner Schell, so in the staff report, it lists what BZA approvals were obtained, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4420)|
| 1:13:51| and the reduction of the minimum lot area required for a two-family from 10,000 to 3,000 was obtained at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4431)|
| 1:14:00| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| Okay, so BZA did know that it was a duplex, or a, yeah, two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4443)|
| 1:14:11| Well, it hasn't received approval for a duplex yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| So I walked by this lot last week, and, you know, this is my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4457)|
| 1:14:25| and if you look at the other properties, like behind it, just those immediate streets over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| a lot of those really small, how wide are those, 20, 25 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| I'd have to look at the flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Some of them are 20, some are like 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| I think there's one of those that's 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Yeah, when you consider, like, what that neighborhood is built out to be density-wise per acre with those small lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4483)|
| 1:14:52| this isn't that out of character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| I think the only thing I don't quite like about it, but this was granted by BZA, is the zero parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| If you have potentially four people living in there, there's probably going to be four cars on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| I'm sorry, I cannot hear you, Nathaniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Yeah, the parking, the BZA variance was granted for zero, which I don't know if I 100% agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| but, I mean, I'm inclined to support this development, special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4519)|
| 1:15:27| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Could we get some clarification on procedures of our body when it comes to special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4528)|
| 1:15:36| You know, could, theoretically, could we add a condition to include parking or to make design changes or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4536)|
| 1:15:46| I mean, I know we're not a design review board, but I'm curious what the, by showing the site plan and the elevations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4546)|
| 1:15:54| like what is the, I guess, intent in us seeing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4554)|
| 1:16:04| In terms of the parking, BZA has already rolled on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| I didn't mean that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Just in general, like if there was an opinion of a condition that should be applied here for the special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4572)|
| 1:16:22| what would be allowed within those conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| And if it conflicted with BZA, would that be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| I don't have anything specific in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| I would encourage you not to place a condition that would conflict with BZA at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| But otherwise, you all, I mean, the intent is for you all to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| and if there are additional conditions that you would like to be considered to have that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| and those to be considered to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| So if you have specific ones that you want to bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| and then we can respond to those whether or not we as staff think that would be appropriate to add at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| And additionally, you know, this was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| There is no one here, again, to object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| So I make the motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| We've got a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Commissioner Schelso, seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| I have a question for Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| It says right here that the setback from the front setback is three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| Is that from the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| I believe it will be at the front of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| In this case, it will be the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| So it will be from the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| One unique thing that I saw, at least I think I've got the right parcel on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| it has some sort of alley access as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| As it's orientated here, the left side is running alongside of a city alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| And granted, I mean, I feel like it has access from two different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| So that's why I would be supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| I would also like to point out there's nobody, no house currently fronts on that block of Douglas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| and nobody currently parallel parks on that block of Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| So I foresee no parking challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| That was brought up at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| And I explained that I preferred some green space being left on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| because parking would be an increase of impervious surface area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Okay, and would they be allowed to park in the back of the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4728)|
| 1:19:10| In looking at the site plans, it does appear that there would be room for a vehicle to park back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| There is a row of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Actually, there's a privacy fence, so no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| So codes wouldn't allow them or there's no space to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4761)|
| 1:19:31| If we could pull up the site plans as part of the file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| there's a 6.5-foot wooden privacy fence that runs along the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| and then along the rear of the property, so both side property lines in the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| So the line with the Xs along it towards the top of that page, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| So the fence would prohibit a vehicle entering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| It wouldn't allow it in behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| And the fence, I assume, is staying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Are you planning on keeping the fence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| I am planning on keeping the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| I'm a big proponent of outdoor green spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| and I'm trying to maximize some outdoor green space at the rear of the structures to be fenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| outdoor space for tenants and residents to utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4816)|
| 1:20:25| All right, seeing no other lights, we have a motion for staff recommendation to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4825)|
| 1:20:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4844)|
| 1:20:51| And item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4851)|
| 1:21:11| All right, so we have a recommendation from the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Staff recommends zoning code amendments to enable middle housing in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| follow the process of implementation as defined by Opticos Design, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| in the September 2022 missing middle housing scan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| and the missing middle housing book summary provided in Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| So that will be the same recommendation for items 15 through 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4900)|
| 1:21:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Is the applicant available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| I am present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| All right, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| I'm here today just to have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| There's room for compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| I'm trying to just move this ball forward because we are in the midst of a housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| and I believe that the advance NOx survey that's come out yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| or today shows the urgency of the situation along with the state of housing report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| and I see and feel it every day through the phone calls, e-mails, text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| Facebook messages I receive with people requesting housing and asking about the availability of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4947)|
| 1:22:34| So I would like to reserve or yield my time to allow discussion by the commission if they so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| We also have another gentleman signed up, Mr. Dustin Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| Mr. Durham here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4964)|
| 1:22:59| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| Okay, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| Yeah, so my name is Dustin Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| Did you say you need address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Home address 1422 Cornelia Street, apartment 2, zip code 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4988)|
| 1:23:15| And I would also like to clarify two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| One, I do have comments that I wrote that you can read in full on the site or probably in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| I am a Knoxville Transportation Authority commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| I am not speaking on behalf of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| I am speaking just on behalf of myself, so I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| So specifically with this ordinance, and, again, you can read it in my comments in full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| but I'd like to just talk about Article 4.1, which is about duplexes and I believe triplexes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5022)|
| 1:23:53| There is nothing necessary or sacred about zoning most of our city to allow only a detached single-family home to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5033)|
| 1:24:01| It is, in fact, the reason we lack the supply to meet the demand for housing in this nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| It is an antiquated and, quite frankly, fiscally irresponsible manner to develop our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| There is nothing less honorable or American about choosing to live under the same roof as another family or non-family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5053)|
| 1:24:21| Allowing duplexes by right in R-1 and R-2 zones is literally the least we can do in order to begin to tame this housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5061)|
| 1:24:32| The character of our neighborhoods has historically been affordable and mixed income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| Continuing to allow exclusionary zoning like R-1 and R-2 is what is truly killing the character of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5078)|
| 1:24:47| We need more housing, and we need it in every residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| As well, we've been hearing a lot of comments on the KTA board with people not pleased with the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5094)|
| 1:25:03| There seems to be a severe lack of understanding of the harsh reality that to have good transit, you need good land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5103)|
| 1:25:12| Our city is just not dense enough to have good transit everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| Density does not mean Manhattan. Density literally just means anything that is slightly more living units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5118)|
| 1:25:26| If we want to have good transit in this city, we have to reevaluate seriously how we zone our residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5126)|
| 1:25:35| We have to start treating alternate typologies of housing as equally worthy of the 75-80% of land in this city that is currently zoned just R-1 or R-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5135)|
| 1:25:50| Whenever I hear arguments about neighborhood character and history, I like to remind people that those can mean different things to different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5150)|
| 1:26:02| Obviously, if there is a concern about the architecture in a historic neighborhood, we have different ordinances to help us protect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5162)|
| 1:26:10| We have different ways to manage that. We have a plethora of different organizations within the city that can help guide those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5170)|
| 1:26:18| But that to me, as I said, a character of a neighborhood is about someone being able to afford to pay their rent and save up so that they can have a better life for themselves when they're older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5178)|
| 1:26:31| So that they can give a better life to their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| If we want to talk about neighborhood history, before about the 1920s, there was no zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| So historically, our neighborhoods didn't even have zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| So I think in the discussion of these things, we need to keep that in mind, that history and character of neighborhoods is not just about how many parcels can sit on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5204)|
| 1:26:56| And that from my view, especially from the view of transit, incremental increases in housing like a duplex in 75% of the land in the city is something that would go above and beyond helping to address the crisis that we find ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5216)|
| 1:27:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| Commission, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Okay, I guess I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| So I was very involved in RICO Knoxville, I guess I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| And a lot of RICO Knoxville, a lot of time that took place had to do with engagement of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5260)|
| 1:27:49| Mr. Marlow, have you engaged much of the community regarding this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| I have listened to neighbors, builders, developers, other architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| I've been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| I've been on the mayor's developers roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| I've been in the missing middle housing scans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| I've talked to real estate agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Have you gone around to talk to many neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| I've talked to many of my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| And what are their thoughts about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| I think the best quote I can give you is from one of my elderly neighbors there in Mechanicsville who owns her own home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| And she told me that if it's your property, then you should be able to do what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| So you know that Mayor Kincannon has asked for us, for Planning Commission to sponsor, to look at this very thing and to come up with their own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5309)|
| 1:28:42| Why, what's the urgency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| The urgency is that we are somewhere between 22,000 and 24,000 housing units short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| We are in a very acute housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| We're having rent rates rise faster than anywhere in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| My phone is constantly ringing, texting, Facebook messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| I've even had people, females, approach me on dating websites looking for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| That's how desperate the situation is getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| It is pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| But I just don't think that passing something like this right now is going to address, why not just wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5351)|
| 1:29:22| How long do you think, Director Brooks, do we have until something will come forth before planning regarding this missing middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5362)|
| 1:29:32| The administration, they have stated that sometime this fall that they would be ready to present something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| I guess, Ms. Minus, I have reached out and tried to work with administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| In fact, before I paid the fee on July the 6th, I had an hour and a half long meeting with the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| at which time they told me they had no written draft, no outline, no guiding principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| They could not identify what they would agree with in my proposal, nor could they identify what they disagreed with my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| And I have re-asked that question as recently as Tuesday and asked where they were on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| And they told me they still have nothing yet that they're ready to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| Well, because it's in planning's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| Is that correct, that planning commission is going to be responsible for drafting something and getting community engagement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5411)|
| 1:30:19| The planning staff has been working with the administration on a plan for addressing middle housing in the city, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5419)|
| 1:30:28| I mean, and I have personal, I respect that you're very passionate about this and that you want to change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5428)|
| 1:30:36| I actually, before RICO-NASL, I was involved in amending our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| It wasn't to the extent this was, but I went through my city council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| I talked to neighborhoods that were affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| We got, we had agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| There was no, there was, I felt 100% comfortable with the properties that were affecting that they had the opportunity to respond and give me input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5453)|
| 1:31:05| Whereas I feel like that is not the case for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| And this is going to affect every residential property in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| And I just can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| I do support what staff has proposed, and I make a motion that we accept staff's motion for, as per written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5474)|
| 1:31:40| Staff's recommendation for the zoning code ordinance to enable middle housing in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5500)|
| 1:31:48| following the process of limitation as defined by Opticus Design, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| and the September 2022 Missing Middle Housing Scant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5512)|
| 1:32:06| So, Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| Wait a minute, we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| I'm sorry, we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| I was waiting on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| I would appreciate, before making a second, having staff clarify the recommendation that they have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5540)|
| 1:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| Staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| So, what we are recommending, as we stated, is the implementation process follow what's defined by the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5558)|
| 1:32:47| I'll break this down briefly, and then I can also quote the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| This is a comprehensive process that will go beyond selected tweaks to the existing zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| We would like for it to include a review of the relevant adopted plans to ensure that the code updates align with the adopted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5576)|
| 1:33:04| We will focus on a target area that's naturally supportive to middle housing forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| include dimensional and design standards to guide how scale buildings compatible with the context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| encourage retention of existing houses via conversion or additions, and then incorporate public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| So, the missing middle housing scan at the end, where they give recommendations for implementing MMH,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5600)|
| 1:33:28| they say work with the community and developers to understand the value of MMH and the findings and recommendations of this scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| I'd say that both planning and the city have continued to work on this step via public meetings and presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| prioritize middle housing within the five to ten minute walkable environments around the existing walkable centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| apply the findings of this scan, so that's the recommendations based on the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| prioritize fitting the desired middle housing types to the actual lot sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| so that's what I've referenced as dimensional and design standards to guide those house scale buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| and then enable middle housing through middle housing zone and standards or through a set of overlay standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5643)|
| 1:34:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| Having heard staff's articulation of the recommendation, I am seconding Commissioner Midas's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5653)|
| 1:34:21| I'd also like to make another comment, and that is that one of the reasons I'm supporting staff's recommendation is that for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5661)|
| 1:34:32| there actually weren't that many public comments on this particular ordinance request or the others that are sequential with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5672)|
| 1:34:42| There were a few, but what was interesting to me, whether they were in favor or against the ordinance request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| they almost all came with some type of caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| They would say, yes, I am for this particular thing, but I'd also like to see this and this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| or I would like to be for this if we could just change these two things, which to me is getting to your point, Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5699)|
| 1:35:08| which is it seems rushed, not that there isn't an urgency, and I appreciate your concern for housing needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5708)|
| 1:35:16| but that it seems that we are making such quick movements with the ordinance request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| that we could end up making some problems that we had not anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| and so I think that staff's recommendation addresses those because it is looking at it in a more holistic fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| and that's why I want to support Commissioner Midas's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| I am not opposed to postponing this to next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| but I just do not want that this just gets left into the ether with no fixed deadline or date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5740)|
| 1:35:49| We do need to take action, and as much as I encourage transparency and public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| none of that is helping the multitudes of people that are desperately looking for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| I've had grown men cry when I've told them that I'm sorry, but you were number seven in the queue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| and number three took the house, and they cried because they can no longer afford the Airbnb they've been in for 45 or 65 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5765)|
| 1:36:13| We need to do something, and we need to do something quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5773)|
| 1:36:21| Unless Commissioner objects, I have another person in the audience that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| Ms. Singh, Councilperson Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| Thank you. Seema Singh, this building, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| I was not planning on speaking today, but I was getting very frustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| and there are a lot of comments that I could make, but I think I'm going to stick with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| I believe what's being asked here is to send this up to Council for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| The last Council meeting we had, we had this room two-thirds full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| and had many people come up here sobbing because they needed housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| I also worked on recode. I was involved in the midnight pizza parties and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| We were staying until very late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| When we were working on that, we didn't have this situation going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| but the most important thing to me is we decided it was a living document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| and that we would continue to look at it, and at this point we are in a crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| and it's time for us to look at it, so I would appreciate if this was sent up to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| for more consideration and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| That's not saying we're moving quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| It will probably spend a lot of time on Council. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| Thank you. Let's see. Let's go with Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| So the code amendment that is typed up and in front of us with the motion on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5869)|
| 1:37:59| if that motion passes, which just says that we recommend a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| what happens to the actual code proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| Is that basically a denial of this code amendment then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5887)|
| 1:38:15| I apologize. Say that again. The question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| The motion on the table to go through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| is that equivalent to a rejection of everything as written in this proposed code amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5901)|
| 1:38:28| That was not the intent of staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| but it was to follow a process that had already been outlined by a scan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| that had been prepared last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| So then my question, if we approve this motion, what happens to this text in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| Where does that go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| I think we're at that point relying on the administration to bring forth something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| Just to add oddity to this meeting, I think that if we table it or postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5930)|
| 1:38:59| it gives, I guess, some option of bringing this back in the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5939)|
| 1:39:08| let's say the administration doesn't act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| That's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| That's kind of one of my thoughts then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| By tabling this, we're able to pull this back up at any moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| 30 days notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| For 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| We could postpone it by X number of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| Either one of those options in a way sort of keeps the heat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| for lack of a better word, on the administration to continue on with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| Keep them on task might be a better way to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| You know, as our council member has also alluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| by passing this and sending this to city council sends that message for them to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| That answers my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| I'm kind of in the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| There's no question we need to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| I do believe it's a living document as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| And I, too, fully hear about the need for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| However, that being said, I think we need to get it right and don't rush it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6018)|
| 1:40:26| and have things force fed and just accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| So I'm all about moving forward, but I do have a concern with the quickness of it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| I don't like delaying things, but I want to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| I mean, I don't know if that's a postponement or a tabling or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| because, I mean, I know we've got a councilwoman saying, I mean, I think there's, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| things coming down from city council to us and to the staff, and we're pushing this up to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| so it's kind of this circular reference in an Excel sheet or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6054)|
| 1:41:00| So I'm not sure where I'm going to land, but I just don't want to rush it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| I want to get it right, but get it right quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Commissioner Myers, would you care if I inquire as to would you be open to a tabling rather than just a consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6068)|
| 1:41:19| I mean, I can consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| I guess I don't see how this isn't going to happen, given the fact that it's already ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6080)|
| 1:41:28| there's a resolution passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| Director Brooks and her staff are already working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6091)|
| 1:41:39| And I think we need more community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| But if it doesn't happen, yeah, I mean, I'm okay having this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| He could bring it forth again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| Bring it back if we don't table it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| It's a question of if it's tabled, can it come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| Or could he bring it back if it was ‑‑ I guess he couldn't bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| I'm fine tabling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| If it's okay with Commissioner Adams, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| I'm not concerned that it's not going to come back to us through the commission as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| I think there are two questions being asked, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| And the first one was Commissioner Schelso asking sort of what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| I'm going to put words in your mouth, to the good ideas that are being articulated in these ordinance requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| And my assumption, and yes, I know what happens when you assume things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| but is that planning would look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| They wouldn't just disallow them because they had come from a different route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| but that they would, along with all of these things in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| consider the good ideas that were in the ordinance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| Is that a true assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| Yes, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| And also planning staff, as well as plans review and inspection staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| have also already given quite a bit of review to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| So our intent is to continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| And I'm sure Mr. Bentley will be involved in the process of gathering input, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| when planning commission is holding community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| And so he as well can give input, just like any other developer or any other resident or property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6191)|
| 1:43:19| I think that by tabling it, it gives all of us more options moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6199)|
| 1:43:26| In the event, and I'm not saying the administration won't bring something forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| you know, to keep them on task, this might be a vehicle to ensure that rather than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6211)|
| 1:43:43| I guess I'd be interested in seeing if our motion would, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| Commissioner Midas' motion would pass before a tabling is considered because I'm not sure it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6227)|
| 1:43:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| So I will get to, I have some thoughts on the discussion that we were just having about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| But in regards to just this request, you know, I do think that we need to take a broader look at our housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6249)|
| 1:44:23| our zoning and how we allow housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| The numbers for many years before the housing shortages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| the numbers have shown that people are moving to areas like our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| And there's a lot of people that would like to one day live in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| And I think that when we, going back to that comment from earlier, God's not making any more land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6285)|
| 1:44:53| we are running out of places to put housing and architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| And we have beautiful ridges and I don't think that anybody wants to build over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6298)|
| 1:45:07| I think that, you know, the discussion earlier about the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| and looking at like farmland that's being turned into housing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| I think that trying to utilize what we have, the infrastructure we have in place for more housing options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6318)|
| 1:45:25| more density is really our most sustainable way to go economically and other, all the ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6325)|
| 1:45:37| But of course I don't completely agree with everything that was proposed in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| And I think that to try to broadly vote on this amendment would be very, very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6343)|
| 1:45:52| and does require a lot of input and modifications from staff and community feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6352)|
| 1:46:00| However, I also agree that while yes, the request has been made for staff to review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6360)|
| 1:46:09| I like that this is evidence of the community trying to push matters through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6369)|
| 1:46:18| And I think that tabling is a great option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| I would even be in favor, and don't get me wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| this is not to say that I fully agree with the language in the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| but I would be in favor of voting for it, sending it to city council and letting them discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| because that is another forum where people will be able to speak to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| and city council will be able to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| And also, as mentioned frequently, those meetings happen in the evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| and more people can attend those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| So again, that's not to say that it has my support from an implication standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| but I do see some merit in sending it, even with the request that has been made, sending it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6417)|
| 1:47:04| So I think at the very least we should table it and leave it in the background as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6424)|
| 1:47:10| But if we wanted to really move the needle, I think there are some other ways to speed it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| But I think that shooting it down right now, I saw the fee that was paid for this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6437)|
| 1:47:24| and this may benefit the applicant, but it would also benefit other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6444)|
| 1:47:32| So I don't think that working on this, this isn't just self-serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6452)|
| 1:47:39| And I think that what we talk about, wanting neighborhood and community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| is a really good example of members of the community trying to push things along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| and encourage positive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| So I don't support a complete shutting down of this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6473)|
| 1:48:00| but I would be in favor of tabling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| Mr. Rutan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| Gosh, I'm getting confused myself here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| My mind was going back, my grandmother used to say the olden days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| and my mind was going back to some of the previous years of planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6497)|
| 1:48:24| and county commission or city council if things wanted to get expedited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| Typically when you come up with ordinance amendments and things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| you want it to get to council so they can reprimand or put it back to planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| to have them make further modifications of what's been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6520)|
| 1:48:46| The quicker it can get to council, they can deliberate some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| but they can just say we want to send this back to planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| let staff look at these requested amendments, particularly certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| and respond to us with recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| Now if staff thinks that that needs to be in concert with administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| we can pull multiple levers, we can do workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| I agree there's a lot of moving parts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| But when you see BZA giving that many variances to try to move things along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6555)|
| 1:49:22| and we get folks that are bringing things up like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| that is a red flag to me that the community is really screaming for something to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6568)|
| 1:49:36| And so if you table it, I don't think it's getting the city council quick enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6576)|
| 1:49:44| unless we're waiting for some sort of reaction that we don't think we're going to get from administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| If you postpone it, at least we have a quicker opportunity to get it to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6590)|
| 1:49:58| Maybe, I don't know, if you deny it, I don't know if the applicant would rather it be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| so he can appeal it to city council and let them deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| and then push it back to planning commission for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| That's something I was thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| I'm here in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| If we believe it would be productive to postpone so there could be further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| perhaps with the administration to find some sort of way to either speed them along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| or find what common ground we can to have something that could get to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| I'm willing to entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| Otherwise, I think time is of the essence and let's either go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6632)|
| 1:50:39| But I am willing to do 30 days to allow for consensus building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| All right. Let's keep moving along here with Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| My assumption was that we are talking about all of these ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| not just the one that is item 15 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| No. I'm seeing mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| You all will have to vote on each individual one, each individual item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| I'm going to call on Deputy Policy Officer Cheryl Ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| and give her a moment to speak on behalf of the city unless there are objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6683)|
| 1:51:31| Hi. Cheryl Ball, Deputy Policy Officer with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| We have been working very diligently with the planning staff on a plan for addressing missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6695)|
| 1:51:46| Council had a workshop on October the 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| and we purposely timed a portion of our presentation to ask them their interest in moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6710)|
| 1:52:01| with some changes so that we could gauge how aggressively we needed to move forward with our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| And we got a lot of real interest in moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| And so since that time, really even before that time, since in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| we've had an internal team and the planning staff have been a part of that moving very diligently forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| because, as you all in particular know, anytime you make a change to zoning code in one place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| it has lots of implications in other places as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| And to a lot of the discussion that has happened today, we recognize the severity of our housing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6756)|
| 1:52:44| We also recognize that we have really important character to our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| and that our community has expectations of us to safeguard those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| And those are both very important things for us to weigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| And so when you're weighing very weighty issues like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| it takes time to make sure that you have put the appropriate plan forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| I cannot commend our planning staff enough for the heavy lift that they have really done in helping us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6789)|
| 1:53:17| as well as several members of our team who are sitting in various places in the back of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| We have been working very diligently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| So the question on everyone's mind, timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| We hope, if we can get the rest of our work done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| we hope to be able to submit something for planning commission to look at and consider for the October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6815)|
| 1:53:44| That is our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| I want to be very clear, we still have work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| There is a lot of steps and a lot of pieces to this process that we believe are really important to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6829)|
| 1:53:56| and we're not done with our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| And we don't want to present something where we really can't answer everyone's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| We want to be able to present something that does not leave a developer stuck between two pieces of code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6844)|
| 1:54:12| so that they can't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| That is a superbly frustrating place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| So this is, I think, the answer that you were probably looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| I hope that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| If you have other questions, I'm happy to take those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| So we have a motion and a second per staff recommendation on item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| We're only dealing with item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| Let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| I'm confused still, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| So this staff recommendation, it's in all five of the code amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6894)|
| 1:55:03| and the recommendation is to follow a process to change the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| But it does not speak specifically to are we denying or approving this to go up to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6907)|
| 1:55:16| If you were to vote to approve per staff's recommendation, these will not be sent up to council at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| Let's try this one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| But we've got time, so if anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| Commissioner Brannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| What's the quickest way to get a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| The real tragedy here is going to be if we're all sitting here in November or December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| and instead of needing 23,000 units, we're going to need 30,000 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| So I'm for whatever ‑‑ I'm for protecting the integrity of our neighborhoods, city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| but at the same time, you know, there needs to be a fire lit to get some resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6963)|
| 1:56:11| So I think my question is if we vote yes to this, is that going to move it quicker or slower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6971)|
| 1:56:26| Mr. Chair, not to be out of line, but I think what I was saying earlier is either way we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| if we vote yes or no, and it gets up or down, the applicant can appeal that decision to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=6991)|
| 1:56:42| and then they can force us to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| If we continue to table it, we'd have to take it off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| We'd have to do things, and we can't even move on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| So if we all feel good about city administration's timeline, if we vote up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7016)|
| 1:57:08| and they appeal it to city council, then it would show up in city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| I'm assuming, the September meeting right before the city administration's wanting to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7032)|
| 1:57:19| and maybe that can work in concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| I'm just trying to, I'm with Commissioner Browning here, if we table it for 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7041)|
| 1:57:29| maybe that gets to, it's safe for us because we're expecting the city to give something that's about the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7049)|
| 1:57:37| but it's not going to push it up to city council any quicker, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| If we approve this per the motion, we've got a city on record saying they're going to have something in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7062)|
| 1:57:53| not at our next meeting, but the meeting right after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7073)|
| 1:58:01| It's pretty fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| I've got one question for Ms. Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| Sorry to let you get seated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7086)|
| 1:58:13| That schedule seems pretty aggressive to me, actually, and are we going to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| can you maybe walk us through the public input, the community input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| I'll be happy to share in greater detail what our timeline is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7103)|
| 1:58:29| We have been working on this, as I mentioned, really since January, but since our last city council workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7109)|
| 1:58:43| so it's not like we started on this two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| It has started really intensely in April, and it is, I will say, we all knew there was going to be a lot to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7126)|
| 1:58:58| but when you get into it, there's more to it than you even think that there's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| and I think even some of our more knowledgeable folks thought that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| Our intent is to move forward with our plans, get them submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| The city is planning to launch a website that is going to provide in greater detail some of the Q&A type questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7153)|
| 1:59:25| we know that we're going to have from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| We have been meeting consistently with stakeholders and community members throughout the last two to three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7168)|
| 1:59:36| on an individual basis to multiple developers, multiple architects, multiple realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7176)|
| 1:59:43| to find out, hey, what about this looks to you like it's working, what doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7183)|
| 1:59:50| We intend to hold two community open houses in the month of September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| that will provide us with the opportunity to share what our plans are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| hear back from the community about what their concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| I would share the tentative dates, but I'm afraid to because they're not locked in just yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| and my locations are not quite locked in, but we're close to being able to share that, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7212)|
| 2:00:19| City Council has also planned a workshop for September the 28th on this particular topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7219)|
| 2:00:27| and one of the requests from city staff for that particular date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7227)|
| 2:00:33| was in an attempt to try to have that prior to your October meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| with the idea that we would love for you all to participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| We're also not unwilling to do a workshop on what our intent is with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7243)|
| 2:00:48| if that is deemed appropriate by your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7248)|
| 2:00:53| And then, in theory, you all would vote in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| and we would have lots of details, I'm sure, to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| Thank you. Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| Hear me out on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| I don't think any of us read through this and thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| yeah, that all sounds perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| I hope we approve that, because there are so many layers to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| and there are so many complexities, and as has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| there is a need for lots of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| I think that, in reality, we can all very confidently know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7290)|
| 2:01:35| that city council is not going to approve this if it were sent to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| after just asking for that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| However, I do think that if we recommend that this goes to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7304)|
| 2:01:52| and that guy right there writes about it and sends it out to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7312)|
| 2:01:59| Meaning, as that gets discussed, that a proposition like this is going to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7319)|
| 2:02:09| that will be publicized and will lead to a lot more, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7329)|
| 2:02:17| public engagement than the current process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| the current process that is making requests for public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| I think that by saying, hey, this is such a big deal that we are recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7344)|
| 2:02:30| that city council look at this, I think that it will lead to a lot of conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7350)|
| 2:02:37| and I think that that will encourage more feedback from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7357)|
| 2:02:44| and I think that city council meeting will probably have some very lively discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| and it might even go really late, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| But I would like to hear your thoughts on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| One of the things I wanted to say is that we can do several things at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| We know how to do hard things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| I respect that the administration is working on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| When Optikos came to the city council workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| they recommended four or five different paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| So I think this is some pieces of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| I like some pieces of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| I don't like, but I do think it deserves further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7402)|
| 2:03:25| It also touches on some of the paths that the administration is not working on at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7405)|
| 2:03:31| and as I said at a city council meeting, this is a time for all hands on deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| and it does make a difference about the time when I don't remember who said what is the rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7416)|
| 2:03:42| Well, the rush is the community is speaking up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| This isn't something that's being done without the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| I think we all hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| I get tons and tons of phone calls, so many e-mails with people just desperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| So if we put things off, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| I thought that I was going to be getting the recommendations from the city in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| That's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| It would be wonderful to have them in October, but every time we're trying to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| I'm not saying I don't want to move too fast and not do things right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| but I want to move, and that's what I'm hoping to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| is to have some movement so this can keep on getting discussed, be tweaked, be changed around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7458)|
| 2:04:24| But if we're not, I just think the administration can do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| and as a person on council, I would like to continue having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| It would really be disappointing that it just stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| It makes me feel like recode and being told that it's a living document isn't being actualized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7475)|
| 2:04:44| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| You know, I really appreciate this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| I agree with Commissioner Higgins in certain respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| I guess I feel like my role on Planning Commission is not ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7497)|
| 2:05:02| I'm not an advocate for the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| I am here to apply a zoning ordinance and look at what would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| based on Planning Commission and what is brought before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| and I just see so many issues in just what I've read regarding these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| that technically I feel like I can't approve this as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7521)|
| 2:05:29| And so I'm just sticking with my initial thought to vote for staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7529)|
| 2:05:38| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| I do feel the same way, which is why I haven't made a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7540)|
| 2:05:47| because it does ‑‑ there are a lot of layers to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| I'm curious, is there a way to send this to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7551)|
| 2:05:58| without it being us saying that we fully consent to these, I guess, from a legal standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7558)|
| 2:06:10| I think that, well, for one thing, from a procedural standpoint, there is still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| I'll remind everyone, a motion and a second that needs to be ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| it was on the precipice of being voted upon, and then we sort of walked it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| So for the clarity of the record, we do need to go ahead, in my view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| when you are ready, we need to call that question and let's have the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| That doesn't mean we can't continue additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| And then, of course, like any applicant who comes before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| there are next levels of review based on whatever action you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| So if there is a denial, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| then the applicant would have an ability to seek an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| If that answers your question, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| Is the current motion one of denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7612)|
| 2:06:58| It would be one that would be accepting staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7618)|
| 2:07:07| which in essence is, in fact, an alteration or denial, if you will, of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7627)|
| 2:07:15| In my view, it would be something that would be capable of being appealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| if that's what the applicant elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7639)|
| 2:07:28| If I may add, the recommendation is more of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| It's not taking any position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| It's kicking this can to some other body or some other time somewhere down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7655)|
| 2:07:40| I mean, at some point we need leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| We need somebody to take a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| Mr. Marlow, I mean, at some point in time I've got to start adhering to the procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7664)|
| 2:07:50| Take leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| Y'all need a moment to think about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| Everybody remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| We've got, let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7695)|

| 2:08:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| Item number 16 is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| Well, we discussed them all together, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| We didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7751)|

| 2:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| So item 16, just as a matter of clarification, what just happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| So we're going, we went with staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| If you wanted to send this, if you wanted to get this to council, you would need to appeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| That was for item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| Now we're on to item 16 and we'll soon hopefully be to 17, 18, and 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| So item 16, Mr. Marlowe, would you like to say anything about item 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7788)|
| 2:09:55| I'll yield my time to whomever else may want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| We've got Vice Chair Uten making a motion to approve per staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7811)|
| 2:10:17| seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| On to item 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| Mr. Marlowe, would you like to speak on behalf of 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7827)|
| 2:10:34| Same old, same old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| I think we need to see some leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| I have people that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| Can they speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| Can they speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7841)|
| 2:10:54| We have Mr. Durham that, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| Yeah, Mr. Durham that was signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7858)|
| 2:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| Well, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| We're on 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| We've got Drew Harper and Anna Parmley that signed up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7874)|
| 2:11:28| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7888)|

| 2:11:36| so that is the background that I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| I was originally signed up to speak about item 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| but I think it also applies to all of the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7903)|
| 2:11:50| We are in a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| As we've already discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| Knoxville is like in the top five to ten for rental and housing cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| increase in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| I just want to say there's a lot of added costs with time and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| money for our local developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| and I think we need to give more freedom to them to build what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| market needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| The community input is that people can't afford to buy a house or rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| And if we don't let developers provide that service to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| then what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| So I would just say that developers are also working diligently at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| great cost to themselves, and we need to respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7951)|
| 2:12:35| And being stuck between two codes is certainly a negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| but it's just hard to condone denying housing and more development to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7959)|
| 2:12:45| our citizens just because it will take a little extra work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| Drew Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7976)|
| 2:13:06| Hi, my name is Drew Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| I'm from 4318 Washington Pike, number 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| And this comment is about item 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| which I think was already voted on, which I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| like I hope that we are able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| Sir, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| Now item 16, we need to comment on item 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| If we're going to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| 16 is what I was signed up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| Well, we already voted on 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| I wasn't, I'm not sure I was prepared for 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| It is the 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| If you'll be brief, go ahead and make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| Well, I was just going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| So 16 was about setbacks and I think it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| it is important to discuss them all because they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| they are about different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| So I just wanted to talk about the safety of decreasing setbacks and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8031)|
| 2:13:57| fact it's a little bit counterintuitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| but we know from studies and things that building buildings closer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| road is actually safer than building them far away from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| That's what 16 was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| I think about Alcoa highway and Chapman highway being some of the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| dangerous roads in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| as opposed to like central Avenue near happy holler and market square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| where there are not a lot of traffic accidents and serious injuries and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| deaths, which is important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| I flipped my, I totaled my car on Alcoa highway last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| I knew it was like very bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| And so just wanted to bring up the safety aspect on the setbacks issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| I am signed up for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| So two minutes, I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| It's me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| First, I guess a procedural comment we've talked about getting community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| So maybe make sure that people who are signed up to speak it to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| before you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| So I support the removal of the ownership requirement for a plot of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| in which there is an 80 you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| this requirement artificially stifles potential development of smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| especially in our historic and walkable neighborhoods where many locals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| already rent out homes, but would like to build an 80 you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| While I understand the desire to have people in our communities that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| rooted there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| I would like to remind everyone that equating home ownership with a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| such as rootedness is dangerous and unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8129)|
| 2:15:32| Many renters like myself are in the same home for multiple years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| owning a house does not guarantee you are in a community for longer as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| homes can obviously be sold per city staff's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8140)|
| 2:15:44| Getting rid of the owner occupancy requirement would be nearly impossible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| enforce, which begs the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| Why even have the requirement to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| I support the removal of lots as minimums for 80 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| as well as a reevaluation of minimum lot sizes in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| removing this requirement for 80 years would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| would begin to allow 80 years in smaller parcels on other types of land in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| regards to potential stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| There are numerous ways to mitigate this in the future and it should not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| preclude us from adding to our housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| I support the decrease of minimum setbacks for 80 years with obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| exceptions given for utility needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| My understanding of the subdivision requirements is that a subdivision is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| new development of six or more homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| So allowing a decrease in the setback in our existing walkable neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| should not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| And I support the removal of maximum ADU gross floor area requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| the increase in the ADU to primary dwelling unit ratio and the doubling of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| ADU height limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| While this may require a change in the written definition of what an ADU is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| there is no logical reason why an extra dwelling unit must be the size it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8211)|
| 2:16:55| currently defined as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| Especially in regards to the ratio limits compared to a primary structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| 50% makes more sense than 40% as an ADU is in essence a mini house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| There is no difference in a large ADU being built and in addition to a home of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| The general scale of an ADU should be treated as a natural and physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| extension of the primary unit even if there is no actual physical connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| Thank you, Mr. Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| Let's go with Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8243)|
| 2:17:28| So I've actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| there was a lot of discussion regarding ADUs and recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| And, you know, just in case you guys, in case you don't know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| ADUs are by a right in all residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| And I've been very surprised that, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| there hasn't been a lot of applications or permits filed for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| I think that this does need to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| I think there's a lot of really good points that were made in this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| The owner occupancy is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| But I guess I would like to see, again, needing more input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| what has been the real barriers for unwillingness to build ADUs on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| properties because I think it's a real opportunity for many families and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| people who are crunched for money to be able to afford a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| buy a house, and rent out a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| In my experience, it's been the owner occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| and the lot size that has prevented ADUs from being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| And on this one, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| If you guys were to vote to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| that would get it to council and save me the appeal fees just as a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| of practicality because everything this costs me will ultimately up my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| housing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| Mr. Marlow, once we bring it to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| we need to keep it right here to commission for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| unless you're addressed, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8327)|
| 2:18:48| Let's go to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| I agree with a lot of the things that were suggested and proposed in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8333)|
| 2:19:01| except for, I think, number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| I think it could go without number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| But, you know, I think to Mr. Marlow's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| there are these limitations probably are some of the things that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8354)|
| 2:19:20| prohibited people from pursuing more ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| And I think that it's important to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| and I hesitate to say this because I know that housing crisis and shortage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8368)|
| 2:19:34| those are buzzwords that get used a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| But what I want to just point out is the people who are most affected by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8376)|
| 2:19:43| rising rates and the limited supply are the people that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8383)|
| 2:19:51| are not the people who have owned their homes for multiple years or have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8391)|
| 2:19:57| already have that set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8397)|
| 2:20:02| It's the people who are looking for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| It's the people who are, you know, living with friends and family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| living out of their cars until something shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| And the more options we have, economics prove this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8412)|
| 2:20:19| This has been proven many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| The more options for housing you have in a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| the lower the housing costs will be because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| by limiting the number of dwelling units you can have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| you've set a cap on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8435)|
| 2:20:38| You've set a maximum amount of supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| but you're not controlling the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| And so I do think that lowering barriers for ADUs, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| it was very, very heavily discussed during recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| And I think that the fact that we landed in a position where it is open for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8454)|
| 2:21:01| any residential neighborhood except for EN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| I think is really telling of the intention for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| So I think that when we're looking at, from since then to now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8469)|
| 2:21:15| the fact that there haven't been an overwhelming number of ADUs and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8475)|
| 2:21:21| haven't turned their neighborhoods into just overrun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| high-density neighborhoods with all these extra ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| like it was feared might happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| I think that it is worth looking at maybe some changes to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| And so I want to actually go ahead and make a motion that we do approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| as it was requested and send this on to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8512)|
| 2:22:00| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| I could second it if maybe we – I have a problem with number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8524)|
| 2:22:12| I have written up and printed a version of this that's been tweaked to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8532)|
| 2:22:19| proposed if anyone wants to entertain looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8539)|
| 2:22:25| Well, I didn't hear what Nathaniel said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8545)|
| 2:22:37| Commissioner Shelshow has typed up a proposal to be considered by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| For this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| Yeah, so if Logan might be open to a friendly amendment, then I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| What this does is it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| May I see a copy of that please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| It keeps the – it keeps a few things in the code as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| It keeps the parking requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| It keeps the 10-foot rear setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| And it keeps the height limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| So compared to Mr. Marlow's proposal, it eliminates number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8586)|
| 2:23:12| And it goes to 50% gross floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8592)|
| 2:23:19| It eliminates the sort of tiered gross floor area requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| In reading the staff report of engineering's concern of like the gross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8604)|
| 2:23:30| – the lot coverage, to me it seems that the ADU would still be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8610)|
| 2:23:36| in total impervious lot coverage areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| So if you have a super small lot, you know, a 3,000-square-foot lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| and a 1,000-square-foot house are – well, I'm not going to do all this math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| in my head right now, but that limitation of the impervious lot coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| is still in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| But I think that this is – it eliminates, as Mr. Marlow's proposal does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| the owner occupancy requirement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| Commissioner Shelshow, would you be interested in keeping item seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8646)|
| 2:24:13| Seven? I guess it's seven or nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| In no case may an ADU exceed 50% of the primary, go back to 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8655)|
| 2:24:23| I think 50 is perfectly sufficient as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| Well, it's not – I mean, it doesn't seem like it's an accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| if it's the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8671)|
| 2:24:34| It could go up to half the size of the main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| Go up to 50% of the primary – okay, wait, maybe I'm reading this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| 50% of the primary dwelling floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| So if it's 1,000 square feet, it could be 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| Okay, all right, I think I misread it. I'm all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| And this still keeps the maximum – you know, it can't go more than two bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| so you can't build an eight-bedroom ADU and call it an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| So I would, if I may, I think withdraw my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8702)|
| 2:25:10| and allow a fellow commissioner to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| because it seems like we would need to read these modifications into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8714)|
| 2:25:21| and I don't want that on my shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| I will withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| So I make the motion to approve the code amendment as presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| with the following modifications, keeping the parking requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8732)|
| 2:25:38| keeping the 10-foot set rear – 10-foot rear setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| eliminating the 18-foot height limit as proposed in the code amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8743)|
| 2:25:52| and then was there another change from maintaining the one parking spot requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8752)|
| 2:26:02| And I will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8762)|
| 2:26:10| Okay, so are we – Commissioner Schelso, can we refer to this as the – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8770)|
| 2:26:27| Okay, so the motion is per this item submitted by Commissioner Schelso| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8787)|
| 2:26:36| as the modifications to the amendment, and we have that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8796)|
| 2:26:43| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8804)|
| 2:26:45| Okay, we have a second by Commissioner Higgins, and we've got more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8805)|
| 2:26:52| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| Now I know why you didn't table 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8814)|
| 2:26:58| And I – for the same reason that I supported the motion before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| I am very uncomfortable trying to quickly modify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| I very much appreciate your good efforts in making the ordinance request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8828)|
| 2:27:16| better reflect what changes could help our circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| but I don't see how making this one edit and moving it forward to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8840)|
| 2:27:26| helps really in the larger picture of what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| So I'm not going to be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| Maybe an ignorant question, but on the striking of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| Commissioner Biggs, if you'll pull your microphone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| Sorry, maybe an ignorant question, but on the – for number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| striking the owner occupancy requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| is there anything in the current code that prohibits –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| or that requires owner occupancy for short-term rentals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| Having previously lived in Nashville, I know that was a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| where there was no owner occupancy requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| You had entire neighborhoods becoming essentially Airbnb neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| where they had EDUs and primary dwelling units being rented out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| as short-term rental units, and that could be an unintended consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| I'm just curious if that's been considered as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| Director Brooks, you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8892)|
| 2:28:15| I don't remember exactly what the – I believe it's in the RN1 and RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8895)|
| 2:28:23| I have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| I think it's only commercially zoned areas can have non-owner occupancy rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| So any residential zone has to be owner-occupied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| Owner-occupied. I want to double-check just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| I believe that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| And I can attest not through my own actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| but due to a mix-up with some records that the city does check that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8923)|
| 2:28:53| and does send notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| If people are violating those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| So I do trust that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| Again, not that I was doing the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| Mr. Marlow, are you okay with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| It's better than nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| I'm not married to the 30-foot height requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| but I have personal experience working through –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| in fact, we're in front of the Historic Zoning Commission next week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| 18 feet is a bit difficult with somebody that's wanting to have a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8965)|
| 2:29:30| with an apartment above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| In this instance, he really needs a 10-foot ceiling height in his garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| to suspend kayaks and canoes over the vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| and then that makes the ceiling height above a little bit challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8978)|
| 2:29:42| without adding dormers on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| And really we think the dormers are not characteristic of his main house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8985)|
| 2:29:50| in historical Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| But we're moving forward because that is the only way for him to get the ADU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| above his garage as under current regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=8995)|
| 2:30:00| I'm flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| I just arbitrarily picked 30 feet after reading staff comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| and the thing that was, I think, added to your packet shortly before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| I propose coming down to 25, 24 feet would accomplish, I think, the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9010)|
| 2:30:16| and still keep it well below the primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| Just remember that when we're talking about a dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| you've got minimum ceiling heights as required by the IRC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| So I wanted to just address a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| because I didn't really speak too much after submitting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| But I thought that these changes kept the ADU section more in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| with the intent of what the conditions of which they were sort of implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9039)|
| 2:30:44| And really the big change for me is it's the non-owner-occupied requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| is the biggest change here to be able to build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| So we haven't seen many in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| And I think the big fear that that was added in was we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| all these absent landlords start constructing all of these ADUs in the backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9061)|
| 2:31:09| And so that's why I think it was initially put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| And given how we haven't seen too many people who live here try to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9073)|
| 2:31:19| because the average homeownership rate in Knoxville is, what, about 50% or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9079)|
| 2:31:24| So if we allow the other 50% of homes to potentially add ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9084)|
| 2:31:30| maybe we'll see even just a—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| I'd say even if 25% of the homes in Knoxville decided to try and do an ADU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| over the next 10 years, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| Let's let it loose. Let's build some ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| But keep it to the code that it was sort of intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| as opposed to allow taller buildings or sort of duplicate houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9107)|
| 2:31:53| So that's kind of the idea I had when coming up with this revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9113)|
| 2:32:03| Okay. Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| More lines here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| Commissioner Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| Yeah, I just wanted to touch on—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| I thought Commissioner Biggs made a good comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| I feel like the difference with this is that you're going to have two—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| in some cases you may have two long-term renters living there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| as opposed to short-term renters that come and go, come and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| and no one's keeping an eye on what happens with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9149)|
| 2:32:34| And so I think that was the real concern with short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| is that you wouldn't have someone on site kind of keep an eye on what's going on with that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9157)|
| 2:32:41| whereas this long-term renters I think are just much more engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9161)|
| 2:32:47| endearing to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9167)|
| 2:32:50| They get to know their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9170)|
| 2:32:51| They're part of the community as opposed to a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| And then regarding Commissioner Adams' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| Part of the reason why I support this is I do think that the community had a lot of input on ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9180)|
| 2:33:06| especially when it came to recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| And Commissioner Schultz is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| We've kind of tested the water, and it hasn't been an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| I mean, at that point we didn't have any kind of ADU, any kind of duplex allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9196)|
| 2:33:24| It was very restrictive the way the previous zoning code was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| And we've tested the waters, and I think that we're—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9208)|
| 2:33:32| I think the community's ready to go ahead and, you know, see what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| and at least send it to counsel and see what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| Just a question of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| It was mentioned of the maximum height, and I'm not seeing where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9224)|
| 2:33:51| So Mr. Marla's proposal has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| I've removed that back to not having it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| which defaults back to the accessory structure code of 18 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| So it's not directly addressed under ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| It goes under the accessory structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9246)|
| 2:34:13| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| Is there any concern that without the owner occupancy requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| the highest and best use for any single family home becomes a dual rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| like detached multifamily property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| and does that potentially eliminate the opportunity for home ownership for a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| given that the highest and best use would become a dual rental property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9269)|
| 2:34:35| I'm not studied on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9275)|
| 2:34:36| It just occurs to me that it could be an outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9276)|
| 2:34:40| May I answer from the field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9280)|
| 2:34:46| You know, we're going to be here all night anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| What's another couple of minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| Go ahead, Mr. Marla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9290)|
| 2:34:51| So this is practically unenforceable, as I've talked to Peter Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| I'm going down an entire block face on Calloway Avenue, or Calloway Street Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9294)|
| 2:34:59| I think it's Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| And I can save the historic structure, get a CO, I can go down to the DMV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9301)|
| 2:35:07| I can give them that address, have a new license printed, run into plans review inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| pull the permit for the ADU as owner occupied on a Monday, run back down to the DMV on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9313)|
| 2:35:19| move to the house literally next door, come back to Peter's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| pull a permit to do an ADU next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| He will not and cannot invalidate the permit he issued the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| And I can go all the way down the block, issue number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| Issue number two, nothing prevents anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| And this is happening throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| I've been hired by neighbors to build these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| I know other people that are building them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| There are unregulated, unpermitted, and unaccounted for and untaxed ADUs popping up all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9341)|
| 2:35:48| They're in the form of a detached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9348)|
| 2:35:52| Detached garages can have bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| They can have showers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| They can have everything except a stove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| A stove is what is significant under the IRC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| So what happens is you put a 50-amp plug in the wall, and when asked, it's a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9361)|
| 2:36:06| That's for a welder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| The moment you get your CO, your welder comes out of that building and a stove is delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9368)|
| 2:36:13| I think that we should err on the side of regulating these, ensuring safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9373)|
| 2:36:19| and proper construction techniques and proper taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9379)|
| 2:36:24| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9384)|
| 2:36:27| He said it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| I was going to respond to that, but I do think that there are workarounds to things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9388)|
| 2:36:34| If that were the case, then I think we would have already seen more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9394)|
| 2:36:40| I've seen instances where people have attempted successfully or unsuccessfully to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9400)|
| 2:36:52| create their own ADU attached or detached, and when unregulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9412)|
| 2:36:59| I mean, that's why we have building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9419)|
| 2:37:03| I think this does make it easier for us to make sure that when these are done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9423)|
| 2:37:13| that they are legal and are built in such a way that it is considering the users and the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9433)|
| 2:37:23| Is there any concern about the parking requirement, the one parking requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9443)|
| 2:37:33| Yeah, it was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| No, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9456)|
| 2:37:37| I mean, it's requiring one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| Yeah, I just left that alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| I mean, if council wants to eliminate that, they can do that when this gets to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| I figured it might be easier to kind of start smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| Start smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| The non-owner occupancy requirement, I think, is the biggest thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| All right, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9478)|
| 2:38:01| We all know what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| Shake your head no if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9487)|
| 2:38:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9489)|
| 2:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9498)|
| 2:38:23| All right, agenda item 18, applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9503)|
| 2:38:28| Would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| Can we scroll down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9514)|
| 2:38:35| What is 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| What's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9517)|
| 2:38:38| And then we've got a couple to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| Okay, yeah, this is straight out of missing middle about getting rid of parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9521)|
| 2:38:47| I left the dwelling above the ground floor alone because my methodology was to only try to mess with what I understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9527)|
| 2:38:52| what I deal with in my day-to-day business, and didn't want to create more problems, so I left that alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9532)|
| 2:38:58| I see that staff had some questions about why it got left alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9541)|
| 2:39:02| And I'll yield the rest of my time to whoever else has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9542)|
| 2:39:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| Mr. Durham and Ms. Parmley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9552)|
| 2:39:23| Do you need me to repeat my address and name for this portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9563)|
| 2:39:27| And just so if others want to take a break, we're going to take about a ten-minute break after number 19 if you want to be in advance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9567)|
| 2:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9576)|
| 2:39:37| My name is Anna Parmley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| Again, I live at 3810 Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| I support also just additionally I know a lot of people are here, and like you said, we might be here all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| but I do appreciate you guys letting me give some community feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9587)|
| 2:39:53| So I just want to say that I support the setback in parking amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| The positives that I see, first of all, it does not ban parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| Parking is still able to be built by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| It does consider street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| It considers proximity to transit, which I think is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| But ultimately, it makes projects more economically feasible for our developers, and I think that's really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9610)|
| 2:40:16| because if they're not, those costs get passed back on to people trying to buy homes and people trying to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9616)|
| 2:40:23| The negatives, if you deny the amendment, I think, again, setbacks are a hindrance to development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9623)|
| 2:40:29| and parking mandates are costly, and that gets passed on to the consumer, and I think that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9629)|
| 2:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9636)|
| 2:40:43| Hi, for the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| Dustin Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| Again, if you need the address, it is 1422 Cornelia Street, Apartment 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9646)|
| 2:40:51| Zip code is 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9651)|
| 2:40:55| I am speaking in support of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| Most of this amendment deals with required parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| and any effort to reduce parking mandates should be welcomed with open arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| Parking mandates, specifically off-street parking minimums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| are a scourge on cities based on nothing more than arbitrary figures, which differ from town to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9671)|
| 2:41:17| Requiring the construction of off-street parking spaces only increases the cost of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9677)|
| 2:41:23| which often results, as Ana said, in apartments and homes being more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| or potential new businesses not opening due to the insane amount of land we require for parked vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9687)|
| 2:41:33| The most common sense and simple thing to do would be to follow in the footsteps of cities like Fayetteville, Arkansas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9693)|
| 2:41:39| or even Jackson, Tennessee, and remove all parking minimum requirements citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9699)|
| 2:41:45| This is one area where the market and local developers know best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9705)|
| 2:41:49| and should have the full freedom to decide how much parking to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9709)|
| 2:41:53| Many do not realize that by removing the mandate for parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| more corridors and streets can become walkable enough to then allow transit to better function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9717)|
| 2:42:03| Requiring even minor parking lots beside, behind, or in front of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| makes a landscape far more dangerous to pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9727)|
| 2:42:11| and honestly far too depressing and ugly to even attempt to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| Compare, for example, the experience of walking down Gay Street to walking on the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9735)|
| 2:42:20| literally anywhere on Kingston Pike in Bearden or Broadway in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9740)|
| 2:42:25| For transit to function best, we must allow cities to develop without requiring cars to dominate everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9745)|
| 2:42:32| At minimum, parking requirements along all of our transit corridors should be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| within one-fourth to one-half of a mile from them, regardless of the frequency of bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9757)|
| 2:42:43| Allowing these corridors to densify will provide the needed population boost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9763)|
| 2:42:48| and tax revenue to increase the cap budget in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| and therefore increase frequency on all of our routes, which would benefit the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9772)|
| 2:42:58| If you end parking requirements, you can watch transit and the local economy begin to flourish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9778)|
| 2:43:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9784)|
| 2:43:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9785)|
| 2:43:09| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| This was an item that I asked about specifically at a gender review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| so for the two persons that spoke in support of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| I want you to know the parking issue is something that I was very keen to completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9800)|
| 2:43:27| That is why I asked, City, are you including this parking component in your review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| Because I think it's very important, and the answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| So that is why I am going to make a motion now that we accept staff's recommendation for item 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9816)|
| 2:43:48| and hopefully I will get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9834)|
| 2:43:55| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| We have a motion by Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| seconded by Commissioner Midas to follow the recommendations of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9839)|
| 2:44:10| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| I think that there is a lot of merit in reducing parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9854)|
| 2:44:22| and I think that I've looked at cases and cities that have done so to the success of the economy and community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9862)|
| 2:44:31| so I think that the one thing that I would say in regards to this is really a request to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9871)|
| 2:44:42| and I meant to say this with the first of these that we spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9882)|
| 2:44:47| but I think it would be really, really helpful, and I don't know how best to execute this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9887)|
| 2:44:54| but as staff puts together these recommendations and looks at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9894)|
| 2:44:59| looking at precedents of cities that may be similar size as our own, plus or minus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9899)|
| 2:45:09| and cities that have done the thing that is being recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9909)|
| 2:45:14| versus cities that have more extreme opposite conditions and requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9914)|
| 2:45:23| ordinances to those conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| I think that would be really helpful for us to look at and see how that has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9926)|
| 2:45:35| what the responses have been in those other planning districts and cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9935)|
| 2:45:41| So that would be my only request with this would be that we get to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9941)|
| 2:45:47| because I'm sure that you all will look at that in your process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| but I would like for us to be able to see that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9950)|
| 2:45:55| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9955)|
| 2:45:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9956)|
| 2:45:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9962)|
| 2:46:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| Item 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9968)|
| 2:46:13| The applicant is once again present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| Would you like to make any comments, Mr. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| So this one seems pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| We just had out-of-the-matrix solutions and developers' roundtable stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9982)|
| 2:46:31| It led to an ordinance change that's in the packet I provided right before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9991)|
| 2:46:36| that addressed something similar that required double-plotting for stormwater issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=9996)|
| 2:46:40| and they eliminated that, and the final plot only has to come to get your CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10000)|
| 2:46:44| I think this similar type thing could apply to landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| so we can get more projects shovel-ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| And then I think responding to the analysis, I suspect that 30% was somewhat arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10009)|
| 2:46:56| My 70% suggestion is arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10016)|
| 2:46:59| I think we need to be mindful of small lots and trying to make them more usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10019)|
| 2:47:04| I could compromise anywhere between there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| And I would like that you would send this up to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| so I don't have to pay yet another appeal fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10030)|
| 2:47:14| Let council have the public debate and workshops or whatever they do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10034)|
| 2:47:18| They're very likely to send it right back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| So just be mindful of how the costs are piling up here for me, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10041)|
| 2:47:26| because I have to pass them along to renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| All right, let's see, who have we got to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10052)|
| 2:47:37| Mr. Harper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10057)|
| 2:47:48| Hi, my name is Drew Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| I'm at 4318 Washington Pike, number 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| That's Knoxville 37917, and I am here to speak in support of this proposed amendment to the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10073)|
| 2:48:00| This one is about reducing landscape buffer yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10080)|
| 2:48:08| I had to deal with this personally in the building that I renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10088)|
| 2:48:12| but also I have a mental health background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| I've worked in mental health and addiction for the past nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| One of those times I was able to meet the Surgeon General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10099)|

| 2:48:26| He's identified that we have a loneliness crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10106)|
| 2:48:30| We also know we have a mental health crisis, especially a teen mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| We know that we have a friendship crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| These are all documented things going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10115)|
| 2:48:38| and that's actually kind of what got me interested in things like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| because we build an environment that cuts people off from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10121)|
| 2:48:47| Like I said, I live on Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| and I've seen physically many examples where the landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| whether it's a fence or vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| I mean, you can see your neighbor's house, but you cannot walk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| So we create neighborhoods where people can't walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| they don't run into each other spontaneously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10143)|
| 2:49:06| and all of these things are whittling away at our collective mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10146)|
| 2:49:11| I mean, there's just walking alone is good for mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10151)|
| 2:49:15| So that's where I wanted to bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10155)|
| 2:49:21| Also, in response to talking about community stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10161)|
| 2:49:25| I just wanted to bring up that we're also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10165)|
| 2:49:30| I would encourage you to also think about future stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| not just current community stakeholders, but people that might move here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| or people that are your children or grandchildren that might turn 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| and want to keep living here, people that might immigrate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| There's more to think about than just the people who already live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10184)|
| 2:49:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10195)|
| 2:49:58| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10198)|
| 2:50:00| I've had a lot of direct experience with the buffer yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10200)|
| 2:50:06| and I think there are some issues with the way this is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10206)|
| 2:50:13| I'm not sure if this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10213)|
| 2:50:17| because I'm actually having a hard time fully understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10217)|
| 2:50:22| what the recommendation here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| but I think there was one example that we all saw a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| those of us that were here, in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10228)|
| 2:50:33| where there was a rezoning on a, I think it was a 50-foot-wide lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10233)|
| 2:50:39| and the reason they were rezoning was because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10239)|
| 2:50:44| if I remember this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10244)|
| 2:50:46| that the buffer yard requirement required that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10246)|
| 2:50:51| a 20-foot buffer yard between themselves and the neighboring property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10251)|
| 2:50:55| But they were a 50-foot-wide lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| which narrowed their buildable space down to 30 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10257)|
| 2:51:01| and it wasn't that it was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| a gas station next to a single-family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10264)|
| 2:51:07| It was an office next to an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| but because of the way this was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| they actually were, it was easier or more feasible for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10271)|
| 2:51:16| to pursue a rezoning than it was to actually build a buffer yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10276)|
| 2:51:22| a smaller buffer yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10282)|
| 2:51:24| So, and again, I may be recalling the details of that a little incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| but I do remember that being a big part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| and that is, in essence, what I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10290)|
| 2:51:32| is there's a, in 12-2, there's a requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| non-residential district abuts a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| You can, well, shoot, we've got a project right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| that we're working on that's townhouses zoned office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10304)|
| 2:51:48| abutting condos zoned RN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10308)|
| 2:51:53| and the requirement is for a 20-foot buffer yard for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10313)|
| 2:52:00| And it's, landscaping is very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10320)|
| 2:52:04| but there are, I think, considerations of scenarios like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10324)|
| 2:52:09| where you actually may have the same uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| even though the zonings are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10332)|
| 2:52:14| Now, caveat, if something like this were to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10334)|
| 2:52:17| that project is already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230810?start=10337)|
