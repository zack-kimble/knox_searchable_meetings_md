| 0:00:19| of Allegiance by Mayor Dan Brown. Tonight, on behalf of the Mayor and members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=19)|
| 0:00:27| of City Council, we'd like to begin the invocation with a moment of silence for the two children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=27)|
| 0:00:33| and one adult that were killed tragically last week, Zakiya Burns and Soraya Glasper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=33)|
| 0:00:39| and Kimberly Riddle. Let's have a moment of silence and then I'll close us in prayer in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| just a moment. Father God, you took these lives from this community. We thank you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=44)|
| 0:01:00| you sent men and women in to rescue them and to heal them and to console and comfort them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=60)|
| 0:01:09| We thank you for these individuals and they're a part of our caring community. We pray tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| for peace in our streets. We pray for opportunities to have conversation about peaceful things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=74)|
| 0:01:21| in a peaceful manner, about how we might be able to thwart the activities of violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=81)|
| 0:01:28| and activities of those that want to commit violence in our streets and in our city. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| pray tonight for wisdom for the issues that are before us and ask you grant us the perseverance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| and the wisdom to consider these issues in a fair and equitable manner. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=102)|
| 0:01:49| Please join me in the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=109)|
| 0:02:06| Please call the roll, Ms. Mitchell. Councilman Brown. Here. Councilman Campin. Here. Councilman Dela Volpe. Here. Councilman Grieve. Here. Councilwoman Palmer. Here. Vice Mayor Pablis. Here. Councilman Saunders. Here. Councilman Steyer. Here. Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=126)|
| 0:02:21| Okay, we're all here tonight. Is there a motion to approve the minutes? So moved. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=141)|
| 0:02:31| Are there any items to be withdrawn? Items for postponement? Councilman Grieve. Thank you, Mayor. Yes, I'd like to postpone 12F until February 17th. The signed task force will be getting back together. We're having another meeting and we plan to come to City Council with our final document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=151)|
| 0:02:51| Councilman Wallace, do you want to second that? Please, please second it, Mr. Wallace. Thank you. It's only three years in the making, Mayor. We all know so well. Councilman Dela Volpe, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=171)|
| 0:03:13| I have received one or more requests that we postpone 12E. Well, wait a minute. Let's vote on it. I thought you were going to speak to 12F. Let's take care of that first, okay? And then we'll come back to you. Okay, so we have a motion to postpone 12F, which is the sign ordinance, until February 17th. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and that is postponed. Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=193)|
| 0:03:39| Yeah, I received a request to postpone 12E, which has to do with a zoning regulation regarding pet services. With the holidays coming, some people who wanted to speak to that will not be available and I don't know that it's so urgent that we can't put it off until the January meeting, so I'll move that we postpone that. Is that to January 6th? Whatever that first meeting is. I believe that's correct. Is that right, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=219)|
| 0:04:07| Okay, so we have a motion. That's 12E on pet services. It's postponed to January 6th of next year. Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=247)|
| 0:04:19| If I could, just as a friendly amendment to that, we're really loading up that first meeting in January and we're going to have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=259)|
| 0:04:29| So move it to the second meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Well, or beyond even, but I just want us to be cognizant of what we're doing to that scheduled evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| We could be here until 1 o'clock in the morning if we're not careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| I would be happy to accept your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| Will you second the amended request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Have you moved to the second meeting in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| So that's to January 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Can that just be the motion? Do we have to? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| So the motion is to postpone 12E on pet services to January 20th. We have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| And that passes. That is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| Anything else to be postponed while we're at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| Okay. Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Consent items. We don't have any of those tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| So now we're on to the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| So first I want to thank Councilman Wallace for the moment of silence during the invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| The school bus accident last week was a tragedy that resonated throughout our community, not just Knoxville and our state, but really throughout the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| It was amazing, you know, the places where this reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| And this is one of those terrible events that I think just stops all of us in our tracks as community leaders or community members, as parents, as teachers, as just people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=350)|
| 0:06:02| It makes us consider our own blessings, even as we are shaken in pain and sympathy with those who have lost their loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| I want to take a minute to recognize all of those who responded that day and afterward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| Chief Roush is not with us, but Chief Houck, you and all of your officers showed tremendous strength and sensitivity throughout the entire ordeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=376)|
| 0:06:25| And I heard many, many compliments and expressions of gratitude toward all of you from across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| So I hope you'll take that back to the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| It was a very difficult day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| You also had a cadet injured earlier during a protest on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| We appreciate the leadership that Chief Roush and that all of you showed on that really tragic day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| And Chief Sharp, actually, we have our new deputy chief here, Gary Compton, sitting in for Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| And I hope you'll take back to him and to the department that we thank you and your department, first responders, all that you do to get to the scene quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| and to help the families, help the children, help the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| Again, it's something that I know everyone is still processing, debriefing from a scene like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| We also had great response from Knoxville Area Transit, and there are many others who need to be recognized as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| I'm sure we're going to leave somebody off, but I do want to recognize Rural Metro, Sheriff's Office, Tennessee Highway Patrol, UT Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=439)|
| 0:07:28| the Children's Hospital, Knox County Schools, security and school employees who rushed to the scene, E911, and TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=448)|
| 0:07:37| Also, the people in the local community and the local businesses near the crash site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| including the folks at Subway who provided food to those working the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| Everybody just pitched in and helped with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| And, of course, our thoughts and prayers are with the families, the friends, and the classmates of the victims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| and with everyone at Sunnyview Primary and Chilhowee Intermediate Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| It'll take a while for all of us to get over this, but we'll always remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=479)|
| 0:08:08| So now move on to a couple of upcoming events that I want you all to know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| Tomorrow, Wednesday, December 10th at 5.30 p.m. at the Beck Cultural Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| the city is sponsoring the final event of our year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=500)|
| 0:08:29| This has been a really great series of events organized by Doshalyn Hunley, our city's Title VI coordinator, and other staff and partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=509)|
| 0:08:39| We have brought to town nationally known writers, activists, lawyers, major figures in the history of the Civil Rights Movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| And there have been forums and films and marches and music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| And tomorrow's night's celebration will feature keynote speaker John O. Hodges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| a professor emeritus in the University of Tennessee's Department of Religious Studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| He will be recounting his own experiences in fighting for civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| and talking about how we move forward in ensuring equal rights for all people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| So this year has been about looking back, but also about looking forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| So, again, that's at the Beck Center tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=555)|

| 0:09:30| We had a great parade last Friday, beautiful weather, big crowds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=570)|

| 0:09:58| and the 20 lighted trees that are floating on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| It's really a beautiful scene if you've never been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| Then next Friday, December 19th, is the annual Tour de Lights bicycle parade through downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=604)|

| 0:10:38| So I hope you all will take advantage of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| And finally, I do want to give a big shout out and congratulations to Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| West High, and Webb for winning their Division State Championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=647)|

| 0:11:23| And I would hope folks can make it over and see this beautiful building if you've never seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| It's going to celebrate its restoration or continued restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| I believe it's going to hopefully be a little faster process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| But it's a beautiful building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| It's a beautiful night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| So I would invite everyone to beautiful South Knoxville and come enjoy and have a good time that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=701)|

| 0:12:11| It's also Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| I thought it was a very frank and open discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| It's something that we need to have here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| So especially I want to thank all the citizens who turned out last night for a rather lengthy meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| But it was well worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=745)|

| 0:14:57| Wait a minute, you're right. Let's get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Yeah, I'll make the motion to obviously to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Okay. Now, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| You know, I want to speak for the 1st District, but I think that when we look around Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| we see it's not just limited to the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| And a lot of my constituency is made up of working class and some low income folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| and there's all different classes in the 1st District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| but particularly these are the ones that I'm concerned with, with what I'm trying to move forward with tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| And I think in the last few years, not only in Knoxville, but throughout our state and throughout our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| we've seen this industry of alternative banking or I call it payday loan businesses for lack of better terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| I think we all know what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| But it's just, it's exploded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| And though these businesses are regulated in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| there's very little we can do about their practices and how they do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| But when I drive through the heart of the business district on Chapman Highway, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| recently there has just been a whole rash of these type of businesses pop up and take root there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=963)|
| 0:16:12| And I don't think it's the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| I don't think we're sending the right business message to what in particular the 1st District, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| we want businesses to locate there, but we want the right type of businesses in my mind to locate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| The predatory practices of these businesses, I think, can lend itself to, you know, crime rate being higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=987)|
| 0:16:36| I think it's a vicious cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| And when you've got them side by side by side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| they can go to one store and get behind and go to the next store to pay the first store off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| And it's just a very bad cycle that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| So, you know, I think that it would be prudent for us to at least move them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| separate them from just conglomerating in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| I think, again, it downgrades that area and it hurts the investment that has been made to date in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| by businesses that I would welcome into the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| So without beating that horse to death any more than it is, you know, that's the purpose for me bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| I know Nashville has addressed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| I think Chattanooga is looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| And I think we should be in the forefront of this and move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| And I urge my colleagues to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Yes, I just wanted to add my name as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1054)|

| 0:17:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| It's not just the 1st District, Mr. Vice Mayor, that has this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| As I drive Kingston Pike, Western Avenue, Clinton Highway, Broadway, you know, throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| this is an increasing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| So I appreciate your bringing this forward, and I'll certainly be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141209?start=1083)|
