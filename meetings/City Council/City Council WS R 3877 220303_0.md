| 0:01:35| Eight present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| First, I'd like to say that City Council welcomes Mayor Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| to our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Mayor, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| Thank you so much, Vice Mayor Roberto, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| It's a pleasure to see you all up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| And this different perspective is a pleasure for me to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| and it's a pleasure for me to be talking about this very important topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| So thank you for calling this workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| and for working with all of us on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| As I mentioned in our budget retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| part of the urgency in having this conversation tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| is that our city is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| We have more people living in Knoxville than ever before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| and nearly 12,000 more residents than we had a decade ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| We've seen more residents, more businesses, more jobs all come into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| And this is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| This is really good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| However, it also means there's an increased demand for city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| New and long-term residents and businesses alike have high expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| for the city services that their tax dollars support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| And due to numerous factors, we are at a breaking point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| in terms of being able to attract and retain the employees needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| I know that you as Council members, like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| hear various requests for city services all the time on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| if not more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Some of the requests that I hear most often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| are requests for more officer presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| requests for faster fire response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| particularly towards the outskirts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| requests for more prompt brush collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| requests for more litter removal in our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| These services are acutely strained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| and we will not be able to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| if we do not address the labor shortages that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| And that will get worse if we fail to adequately address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| our lagging compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| We're here today to talk about that compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| specifically to review the findings of the comprehensive study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| that MAG has recently completed with our human resources team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| And by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| thank you for supporting the establishment of a human resources department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| We could not be here without their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| So I just want to give a little round of applause to our HR team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| They've worked incredibly hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| It's also been really important that we've had input from our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| the entire time, including on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| which I'll get to in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| But I don't know if you've ever been involved in surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| but if you get 10% or 20% of people to respond, it's a good survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| We had over 50% of our employees respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| So over 700 employees filled out the survey for this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| So that is a really good track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| So you've heard a little bit about my proposed plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| when we had the announcement a couple Fridays ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| at the downtown Central Fire Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| And this plan was based on this study and MAG's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| which you're going to hear a lot more about shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| This is a plan that I hope you'll join me in implementing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| and not over several years, but implementing it all in this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| I want to take a moment to recognize our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| More than 1,550 of them have been working across the city today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| like they do every day of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| They have been out working no matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| and under some very trying conditions over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| They work with pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| They work with integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Getting to interact with our employees, many of whom are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| thank you for being here, is one of the best parts of my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| I have so much pride in the work they do and so much gratitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| and their compensation needs to reflect how valuable they are to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| So thank you to the employees for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| and I also want to recognize in particular the members of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| who have been part of this process from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| They have served alongside the consultant and our HR team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| in advising this compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| So that includes KPD employee rep investigator Jason Booker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| KFD employee reps firefighter Larry McAfee and Kevin Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| You can raise their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| General government employee Steve King from engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| Christine Stickler, director of employee benefits and risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| Christine, raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| Chad West, director of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| The man in pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| And Nick Bradshaw, who has been a huge member of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| but could not be here tonight due to an unexpected family emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| But Nick has been an integral part of this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| So to kick us off tonight, as Vice Mayor Roberto requested, and I totally agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| it is most important that you hear directly from employees about the ways that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| and the teams they represent have been impacted by the increasingly acute retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| and recruitment challenges and the long-term concerns that they have raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| related to compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| So without further ado, I'd like to turn it over to our employee representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| to share their perspectives, and we'll start with KPD employee rep Jason Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=392)|

| 0:06:41| Mayor, Investigator Booker, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| Actually, we're going and general government is going first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| And just as the mayor had mentioned, and thank you, mayor, for your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| this workshop is about our city's employees, and we welcome each of you joining us here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| as well as you watching at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Before I call up each of the representatives from the three employee groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| I just want to say thank you for all you do for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| The people of Knoxville depend on you, and we appreciate the service you provide for us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| General government, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| I appreciated your call the other day and inviting me to come and make a brief presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| You know, I didn't even realize it, but I started making some notes this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| Today, March 3rd, is my 42nd year here with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| My 42nd anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| So you think you're here for a council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| This is really a celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| So you get to listen to me for a few minutes, but it won't be too painful, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| One of the things that I thought about today was trying to go back and count how many mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| how many directors that I've worked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| But rather than recite that, I think what I'll do is just tell you a common theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| Almost every mayor and every director that I've worked for, and you all know I came here as a staff-level engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=488)|
| 0:08:17| and have been a director myself and currently deputy director of engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| but almost everyone would tell me, I can't believe what quality of employees the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=501)|
| 0:08:29| You know, unfortunately, the public thinks we're just government workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| But, you know, we have our general government employees, and I don't mean to discount police and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| but you all are going to have your chance in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| But, you know, we hire the same accountants that UT graduates, the same engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=525)|
| 0:08:55| the same electronic graduates to work on traffic signals that some other company might hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| We compete for the same kind of employee, and if we don't keep up, we will begin to lose employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=541)|
| 0:09:12| So I'm proud of the fact that all these mayors and directors are happy with the employees they find when they get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| But if we're going to keep on with these quality services, we have to keep up with a skilled and competitive workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=560)|
| 0:09:31| We're a great organization. We provide quality service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| You know, our public service department is out there in all kinds of weather, clearing the snow and ice from the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| They're picking up brush and leaves in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| They're patching potholes when they get a response or a request from 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| We do a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| But it has been several years since we've had a complete comprehensive pay plan study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| I've seen several of them through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| I think the last one was over 10 years ago, and I don't think it was completely funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| You know, through the years, I've been fortunate to work with civil service staff and now HR staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| in trying to improve the situation for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| And I want to commend this administration and this council for funding this pay plan study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| It's long overdue, and it can be done at whatever interval an administration wants to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=630)|
| 0:10:38| But I think it was very wise by this administration to fund it now because it's long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=638)|
| 0:10:47| There's a lot of challenges in hiring new employees as well as trying to keep our trained employees from leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| They get job offers, hire jobs, and our ability to keep these core services going is strained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=655)|
| 0:11:03| There's a high volume of workload just to keep up with the mayor mentioned litter pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| I understand from our public service department sometimes we're not even able to get to that because of a high volume of workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=670)|
| 0:11:17| And the challenges of COVID over the past two years have really stressed our employees and our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=677)|
| 0:11:26| Let's focus on public service for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Right now, I think we have 47 vacancies in the public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| Many of those are our entry-level positions who do a lot of the work that our citizens have come to expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| like pothole patching and leaf and brush pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| These employees have had to work overtime just to keep up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| but they haven't been able to get to some other things like we'd like to do, such as litter pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| In our building inspection department, many of you know developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| and you know when you need a permit, you can't get it too quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| So there's a lot of stress for those employees that review plans on a routine schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| They have to keep up with the training in their particular trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| and we've begun to lose some of those employees that have that ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| because they can go somewhere else and have less stress and also higher wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| In fleet, you know, we've got a lot of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| Police and fire may talk about their vehicles, but the city has a lot of vehicles to take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| and the same quality individual that repairs our city vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| is also in high demand to repair the general public vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| So there's always a situation where those employees are being pulled in other directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| In engineering, we have found that through the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=785)|
| 0:13:15| our construction projects stayed on schedule because contractors are still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| Our employees who do design and do field inspection work continuously right on through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| and those employees are a valuable asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| They're a valuable asset to the city, but they're also a valuable asset to others who might want to hire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| So I want to reiterate along with what the mayor said about requesting your support for this MAG study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=821)|
| 0:13:51| It could really change the game as far as the city's ability to recruit and retain top talent and top employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=831)|
| 0:14:01| We look forward to working together with HR staff, Dr. Drummond, and the administration and MAG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=841)|
| 0:14:09| as we move forward to the next steps to make this important investment in the city's workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| All right, Investigator Booker, to give us the perspective from Knoxville Police Department, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=862)|
| 0:14:31| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Sorry for the mix-up at the very beginning, but glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| If you could, go ahead and let us know about what your experience is or what the experience has been from KPD's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| Sure. I can tell you I've been here for—I'm starting my 24th year here with the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| I am currently a violent crimes detective, and I can tell you from my personal perspective, I've never seen this shorthanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=889)|
| 0:14:58| We've got guys and gals working 12-hour shifts, forced overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| We need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| To retain quality employees and to attract quality employees, we need to address compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=905)|
| 0:15:13| We are a service industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| We're here to serve the citizens of Knoxville, and the citizens of Knoxville deserve the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| And I can tell you I'm proud to serve as an Knoxville Police Department officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| and I serve with some of the best officers in the nation, and I stand behind that quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| But we're behind, and we need help, and we need your support in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| We're currently down about 50 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Forty-two of those are sworn officer positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Just some numbers, just black and white numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Our current authorized strength is 416 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| We only have 374 sworn at this time, so that's 42 under our authorized strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| We have 90 officers that are eligible to retire within the next 23 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| We have 49 officers that cannot show up tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| They're eligible for retirement today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| In the last two years, we have only graduated 77 officers out of the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| This includes 61 traditional recruits and 16 lateral hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| The lateral program is a great program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| and we're really relying on it to get officers on the street right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| In the last two years, we've had 82 officers leave the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| Fifty-five have resigned, 25 have retired, and two have medically retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| This proposed pay raise and these benefits will go a long way in retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| highly quality experienced officers that are already with KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| and ensuring KPD is competitive in the job market for attracting quality applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| To train an officer costs thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| and when we get an officer here and we lose that officer in just a couple short years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| or maybe not even a year, that really hurts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| That doesn't just hurt the police department or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| That hurts the citizens because we need qualified officers here at the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| and we need to award those officers for staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Next up is Kevin Faddis with the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1042)|

| 0:17:24| Some ladies showed me how to run this thing last time I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| I think I've got to find the up button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| I feel bad for the people behind me, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| I'm wearing shorts and I've not really got my tan on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| I'll keep it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| I talked to one of the officers I see back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| He told me he'd give me a desk pop if I run too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| If you all know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Now, first off, I want to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I want to thank the mayor and Dr. Drummond and council for realizing that we do need this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1070)|
| 0:17:59| As the previous speaker spoke, we've had a few of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| and the problem with these have been they've not been fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| So with that, we look forward from the fire department, police department, general service, general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| we're looking forward to being fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| So with that, we're grateful and thankful that we can work with you all and hope that it gets passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| We as a fire department, just like police and the other organizations, we're a service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| It's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| We serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| We serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| It's where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| It's where we play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| It's where we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| So it's important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| We take to heart our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| I want you to know that the Knoxville Fire Department, you should be proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| Last year, total number for calls for service was around 24,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1127)|
| 0:18:56| That's how many that were documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| There's some that don't get documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| That does not include pre-fire planning, smoke detector programs, things to help the citizens and the businesses stay safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1140)|
| 0:19:12| During this pandemic, I don't want to harp on the pandemic because even before the pandemic, we never, anytime the alarm goes off, we never missed a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1152)|
| 0:19:22| Never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| We don't sit there and say, well, gosh, we can't go to this one because, well, maybe I'm not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| No, we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| We have never missed a call, even in this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| We continue to train daily and monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| I want you guys to know that the men and women behind me that wear them funny looking hats and turn out gears, we train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| We train constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| As a matter of fact, we led the state in training hours last year during a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| We're on track to lead training hours again this year for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| It's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Right now, right now, as Officer Booker spoke, Investigator Booker spoke in the police department, we're coming up here in about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1200)|
| 0:20:12| We're going to have 75, a little bit over 75 people eligible to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| I mean, just walk out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| That's one third of your city's fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| On a shift, there's roughly around 90 people, so less than one third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| But roughly, there's 90 people per shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| We have three shifts in the firefighting division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| We need to retain these people for experience reasons and just for the good of the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1235)|
| 0:20:46| In 1996, I'm showing a little bit of my age is when I came on, and I had a mullet, and it was sexy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1246)|
| 0:20:56| But in 1996, look at these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| We had over 2,000, some of these guys can remember, over 2,000 applicants to get my job, 2,000 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1259)|
| 0:21:10| And we had to take tests over at the human, over at UT somewhere, human relations office, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| It was a big place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| But now, we're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| What we're looking for people is between 150 to 250 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| You know, we want people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| I'm sure the city of Knoxville and the mayor and council and even the constituents, the taxpayers, they want the best that they can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1287)|
| 0:21:37| Right now, due to staffing as well, not as bad as PD, but we're having to mandatory firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| What that means to us is a 24-hour shift turns into a 48-hour shift, which later turns into a 96-hour shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1305)|
| 0:21:54| We give a lot to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| We give a lot of ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| My son's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| He knows, you know, I'm gone one-third of the time, one-third of the year working because I love what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| These guys love what they do, or else they wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| So their dedication goes a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| Again, I wanted to talk about being here in the last, I think since 1996, I've been a part of every single salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1336)|
| 0:22:25| And that's what made my hair fall out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| So we're certainly excited, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| I cut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| But we are excited to be able to communicate with the mayor and Dr. Drummond and her staff, David, Christine, and you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1352)|
| 0:22:43| because communication's what gets it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| And hopefully I've given you all some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| I look forward to moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| And the mayor actually, she called me a wordsmith one day, so that was a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| But we genuinely are looking to recruit, retain, and reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| So with that, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| All right, next we're going to get into the classification and compensation study report with Dr. Drummond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| Welcome, Dr. Drummond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Certainly we've heard from the employees' perspectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| and just some highlights that I heard there were 12-hour shifts for police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| almost 50 vacancies in public service, many of them in entry-level positions that are on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1413)|
| 0:23:42| doing the work, the service that we all have just talked about that our citizens have asked for and need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| And then with the firefighters just then, you know, these mandatories where they could be working up to 96-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| So this is a really critical report, and we just really appreciate you being here to help us wade through all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| So I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| I appreciate your time, and I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| I will start by saying when I started a year, a little over a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| one of the most important things that we talked about was what was going on with our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| and what do we need to do as we think strategically for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| We were in the middle of COVID, but COVID was not the beginning of what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| This is a process in order for the city to become an employer of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| We need to make some different choices, and we need to become more competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| Given our current situation right now, we have to contend with other individuals in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| As public service, as you heard about public service and those entry-level positions, we're competing with your McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| We're competing with your Bojangles and those types of employers that are paying $15 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| One of the things that you're going to hear recommended is a $15 an hour minimum payment for our full-time and permanent part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1507)|
| 0:25:17| As we think about the area of vacancies and what we have, they talked about the current vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| Every day this changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Yesterday, it may be 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Today, it's 149.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Every day this number changes, and we're in a critical situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| They've already talked about all of those, so I'm not going to reiterate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| But we also have to think about strategically what happens in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| So we can make some changes, or we can choose not to make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| But if we choose not to make changes, it's going to truly impact what happens in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| As I talked about, there are multiple individuals that are able to go on a drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| And when we talk about those, those individuals have met their time with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| They still have years of work available to them, but they have made a decision to leave the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| If we're able to retain many of those employees, we will not have a loss of knowledge and experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1567)|
| 0:26:16| If those individuals that Battalion Chief just talked about, if they lose those individuals, we're going to have a big loss of knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| We've already talked about what's happening with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| We also have some of those issues in finance, we have those issues in IT, we have those issues in engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| So this is all across the city, not just police and fire, but we're looking at what's going on across the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| So I want you all to think about what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| In 2007, there was a complete comprehensive study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| That study was implemented in adjustments, and it was a $2.6 million adjustment over three budget years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| So I want you all to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| That was over 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| That's been much longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| So we look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| We are looking at 15 years ago, and it was $2.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| There was some issues that came out of this survey that were concerns of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| What we then did in 2015 was at the end of, between 2012 and 2015, there was a single public safety compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1640)|
| 0:27:30| And this study looked specifically at the uniform body and did a very small approach and did not impact our general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1650)|
| 0:27:40| So in 2020, you all brought on the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| I say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Our team says thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| And I think that we're trying to make a difference in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| But as a result of that, one of the first things that we brought before you when we asked for your help last year was to bring on a comprehensive classification and compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1671)|
| 0:28:04| So this is very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| This is something that we're looking at at all positions, not just police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| We're looking at all positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| And so we also did a benchmark of over 132 different positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| We were able to do a process and able to retain management advisory group to do this comprehensive study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| This comprehensive study is what we're going to spend the next little bit talking to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| I want to take the time, and I'll know that you'll introduce, but I want to tell you who we have here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| We have been fortunate enough to work for the past six months hand in hand with MAG, the management advisory group, and they have worked with us on completing this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1718)|
| 0:28:52| It has been comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| It has been hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| It has been difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| But we are at a place that we are able to give you some great results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| And we have with us now Russell Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| He's a senior vice president, and he will explain to you all of his background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| But he's very, very experienced with this, and he'll share some stories of his experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| But I think after you hear this and get a full understanding of what we have, you may have additional questions, and we're here to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1755)|
| 0:29:23| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Thank you, Dr. Drummond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| Good evening, Mr. Vice Mayor, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| My name is Russell Campbell, senior vice president with Management Advisory Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| and I am the architect of the compensation plan that has been put before you that you will be considering for implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1782)|
| 0:29:51| I've been working with the city for the past five and a half or six months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| And during that time, I've heard things like, we're a city on the rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| We are a community that prides itself on clean streets, safe streets, nice communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1799)|
| 0:30:09| We're friendly to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| And so in order to fulfill those words and that vision requires a number of policy changes, a number of policy initiatives or program implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1813)|
| 0:30:26| But one of those that must be addressed is compensation of the employees who make it all happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| the people who clean the streets, patch the potholes, the officers who patrol the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| and the firefighters who respond to fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| So it requires bold action with respect to making sure that those individuals are paid competitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1844)|
| 0:30:52| And so I make no apologies for the extent that this is a bold compensation program and proposal that we are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1852)|
| 0:31:03| But this should fall in line with the vision that the mayor has expressed, the vice mayor, individual council members, about where the city is going to go in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1863)|
| 0:31:15| And if I could just share one quote with you from Thomas Cole, a philosopher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1875)|
| 0:31:23| A fair day's wage for a fair day's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| It is just a demand as governed men ever made of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| It is the everlasting right of man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| So Management Advisory Group is headquartered out of Fairfax, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| Been in business over 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| I've been doing this for 25-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| I've done about 200 of these studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| I've done them from the East Coast to the West Coast, to the North and the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| In some very rural communities and some very urbanized areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| But one thing remains a constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Employees want to be compensated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| They don't want to be overpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| They don't want to be underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| They want to be paid for the value of their contribution to the organization they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| And we've assisted municipalities, counties, school districts around the country achieve that objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| We've done over 500 of these studies around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| There are some significant goals and objectives associated with this study that I'd like to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| All the positions that we were told that were subject to the study have been included in the study and in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| We work with staff to come up with a comprehensive list of what we call peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| Other organizations, whether they be municipalities, counties, or federal agencies that have similar types of positions within their organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1962)|
| 0:32:52| We wanted to make sure that we go back and make sure that, and this goes along the lines of equal pay when it comes to male and female employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1972)|
| 0:33:02| We wanted to make sure that the value of the job remains constant, no matter who's in that position, whether it be a male or a female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1982)|
| 0:33:11| Quite frankly, this study wasn't about any individual or any group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| It was looking at the value of the jobs, looking at labor from the standpoint of it being a commodity, no different than orange juice or gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=1996)|
| 0:33:25| This was not an assessment of anyone's performance, how well they do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| It didn't matter who held the position at the time the study began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| It was the value of the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| As we looked at the duties and responsibilities, the qualifications of the positions, and then looked out into the marketplace to see what was being paid by comparable organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2017)|
| 0:33:48| we developed what we believe to be a very competitive pay structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| If I take a moment, I want to say something about what does it mean when I say competitive pay structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| I'm not saying that the city of Knoxville has to be the top paying entity in the region or in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| If we look at pay on a spectrum of one to ten, ten being an organization that pays superior wages, outstanding benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2047)|
| 0:34:16| At the other end of the spectrum is an organization at the one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| Wages are subpar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| They invest in training people only to see them leave within a short time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| And it becomes a revolving door of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| You may visit one city office or county office one week, and you come back to follow up with the person that you initially spoke with, and they're no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| There are organizations like that everywhere throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Practicality says you cannot afford to remain at that ten level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| The only entities that I've seen that pay significantly above market wages are electric cooperatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2089)|
| 0:34:58| And I won't get into why that is the case, but that is the only entity I've seen that's able to sustain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| At the one level, service delivery would be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| Citizens would be upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| They'd complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Their service needs are not being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| And so when I say competitive, you can't be at either extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| But you can survive and even thrive somewhere around that seven or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| When we started this process, the overall market position of the city was somewhere around the 65th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2124)|
| 0:35:36| The report and the plan that we've designed moves general government to the 75th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| Public safety moves roughly to the 80th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| And we believe those positions are strong enough to allow the city to compete with anyone in the region with respect to labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2148)|
| 0:35:58| I do a lot of quality of work life assessments for both public and private companies around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| And when I meet with those employees and we talk with them and we conduct confidential surveys and reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2165)|
| 0:36:14| and one of the questions is, why have you stayed here or why did you come here initially to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| Pay does not always come out number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Sometimes it's number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Sometimes it may be number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Job security could be number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Affinity for the leadership that they're under could be number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| But pay will always be in the top three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| It's a major consideration, but it will not be the tipping point with respect to whether someone comes or stays with an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2197)|
| 0:36:46| Another thing we looked at, we wanted to make sure that the organization is adhering to the standards of the Fair Labor Standards Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2206)|
| 0:36:54| which governs which positions should be qualified for overtime compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| We also took a look at your benefits package, compared that to the other organizations that we collected wage data from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| And we found that the benefits package is very competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and there were minimal recommendations to change your overall benefits package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| It is the compensation where the city is struggling and needs to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| We're also in the process now, as we enter the last stage of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| to update all the position descriptions for the jobs within the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| So what was the methodology that we used to design the new compensation structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| A couple of misnomers that I'd like to address out of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| First of all, when we were collecting the information from the other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| and I'm going to show you those organizations shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| we were not collecting actual salary information on the individuals that are working incomparable jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| jobs similar to that you have in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| We would collect the information on their pay structures to determine what they perceive to be the value of the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| You cannot build a statistically valid compensation structure or system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| trying to do so based on actual salaries of incumbents in positions in other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| It would not hold scrutiny from a statistical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| And so our methodology was to collect that pay structure information from these other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| And then we wanted to internally rank the jobs within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| Not all jobs are paid at the same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Some may be paid at a higher level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Some may be paid at a lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| And it is this process that helps come up with a valid measurement of justifying those different pay levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2325)|
| 0:38:54| And so in order to get the information on the job positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| I think you've heard someone mention a questionnaire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| about a 22-page document that was hosted on our website and our server that we asked the employees to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| so that I could facilitate the analysis of all the positions using the criteria that we've patented and copyrighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2348)|
| 0:39:17| to build that internal relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| That is a starting point when designing a comp structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| And then the second point is to analyze that market data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| We held meetings with department heads one-on-one to talk about recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| and retention issues in their respective departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| We talked with HR about historical challenges with respect to positions in different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| We looked at data from exit interviews to see where other people who had left the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| where they were going and why they were leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| And consistently, one of the reasons they were leaving was compensation or pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| We went with the city's HR committee to get their input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| to find out what their thoughts were and concerns as it relates to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| And so all this information went into that initial assessment to build the internal hierarchy of the positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2407)|
| 0:40:16| that were subject to the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| The comprehensive market survey that we put together entailed 135 different positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| one of the largest market surveys I've done in the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| Typically, for statistical validity, you only need to benchmark 20% of the total number of job titles in the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| But because compensation was such a sensitive issue in this organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| Dr. Drummond and her staff wanted to make sure that the survey was broad, it was comprehensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| and that it addressed a strong family or range of positions within the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| In order to make the compensation work effectively as it was designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| it requires administrative policies and procedures so that there's consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| there's fairness and equity when it comes to determining starting rates of pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| so it's consistently applied to applicants no matter what department they're in or what job they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| Make sure that we have consistency, equity and fairness when it comes to deciding compensation for promotions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| transfers, temporary assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| All those things were part of the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| And then, of course, as we put it together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| we started calculating the cost impact of the study for implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| I talked briefly about the internal relationship of the positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| In order to build that relationship, that hierarchical relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| we employed the following job factors as you see before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| There are 14 of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| As we go through and assess each one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| as compared to the duties and responsibilities and qualifications for the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| we assign a rating that ranges from 1 to 10 in each one of those categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| For example, when we talk about data responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| we're looking at the different types of reports, records, documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| that the employees either produce, review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| and what's the disposition of those reports or documents once they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| It could be something as simple as a budget document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| as complex as a strategic plan, incident report, or maintenance report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| And as I grade them with my matrix, which provides consistency in terms of scoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| I'm able to build that hierarchical relationship after I've evaluated the last position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Every position was subjected to this criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| in terms of determining which pay grade that it would be ultimately assigned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| With respect to the market survey and those target organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| we looked at, again, one of the largest number of groups that we've looked at in some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| There were 29 different organizations that comprised the market survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| Obviously, we started with communities and cities and counties here in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| such as Muffersboro, Chattanooga, Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| And then we looked at some of the border communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| such as Louisville, Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| And then we went over to Virginia, Charlottesville, North Carolina, Asheville, Charlotte, Raleigh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| Columbia, South Carolina, Greenville, South Carolina, Atlanta, Georgia Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| the Federal Highway Administration, and the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| We were not looking to replicate the pay structure of any one organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| but to build a structure that was a composite of the average value of the positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| as it relates to the information that we secured from those organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| Because of today's labor market, which has been unlike any we've seen in the last 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| there's no longer a divide between public sector and private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| They're simply employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| And so in order to do this and to make sure we have a fair compensation plan for the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| we have to look at what's being paid in private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| But unlike government, we cannot demand information from the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| Governmental entities are subject to FOIA requests, freedom of information requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| When we submit our original requests and ask for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| if they don't respond within a reasonable time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| and then the state allows for administrative measures, penalties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| to encourage them to provide that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| That is not applicable to the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| But that information does exist, and there's a way to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| And so in order to use private sector data, regional data, private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| we go through the Federal Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| which collects that information on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| So for those jobs that exist in the city that we could find in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| that data was part of the overall statistical process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| with respect to producing the new pay schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| And so in summary, irregardless of who's doing the analysis or what company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| the two tenets that must be adhered to when you design a compensation system are, on the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| internal equity where you're evaluating the jobs based on a criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| to determine the value of the given positions in the organization under study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| And then to the right there, it says external equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| You've got to define the market locally, regionally, collect that information, analyze it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2734)|
| 0:45:43| clean the data to make sure you have clean, accurate comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| Once that is done, you literally have two sets of data that don't hold a lot of meaning individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| But to give them meaning and purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| you have to use some type of statistical modeling technique to bridge together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| the market data and the individual job evaluation score based on the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| We use a process known as linear regression and a software application that we patented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| to actually produce the new pay scales once those two inputs are put into the software application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| Then we're able to go department by department to look to see how the study results impact each individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| the department, and then ultimately how it impacts the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| Once that has been determined, the next step is to look at different ways to implement the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2794)|
| 0:46:42| 95% of the organizations we work for, and by the way, our client base is 100% public sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| 95% of the organizations we work for have a goal of implementation within the next fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2809)|
| 0:46:58| and they're able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| We have a small percentage of clients, roughly 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| where resources are not sufficient enough for the organization to implement the results of the study in one fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2823)|
| 0:47:11| so it has to be staggered in over two years, but no more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| If you try to spread it out three years, you're going to have problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| because there are going to be things that will change with respect to internal operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| departments are restructured, mandates change, goals change, leadership changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| and then externally you don't know what's going on with the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| So we advise those when it has to be structured in over more than one year that it has to be done within three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2854)|
| 0:47:45| One of the most exciting conversations I had when we started this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| was the mayor's enthusiastic vision to find a way, no matter what, to implement the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2870)|
| 0:47:58| I think she's prepared to write a check to do that if she had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| And so that was good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| So what did the market data tell us about the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| It paints an interesting picture, not the worst picture I've seen, certainly not a Picasso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| At the minimum or entry-level rates, the city is 10.5% behind the market on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| At the midpoint, or market averages themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| which is where you generally find the majority of employees in a particular occupational group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| the city is about 9% behind the current market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| At the top end, the city is about 8.4% behind the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| The range width from the low end to the top end in terms of value of a position, the spread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| the spread for the market peers was about 49.8% and the city was about 54%, which wasn't bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| But you can see we have significant issues with competitiveness across the pay structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2932)|
| 0:49:02| In consulting, there are some benchmarks that you look at and you use as a guiding point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| as you develop the new study and the new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| And that is, one of those is the 5% rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| Anytime the organization as a whole is greater than 5% behind the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| or individual positions are greater than 5% behind the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| that's usually a strong indicator that the organization struggles to build applicant pools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| that have strong, highly qualified individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| And it also is an indicator that in some departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| the organization is probably struggling with retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| Further, with respect to the market survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| I just took a sample of positions from both extremes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| just to highlight some of the jobs and positions where the city was competitively paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| with respect to the pay levels, the ranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| and then some positions that were extremely non-competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| On the competitive side at the top, we have positions like administrative assistant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| graphic designer, planning manager, community development tech, and customer service supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| And then on the non-competitive side, and all of these jobs here were at least 5% behind the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3018)|
| 0:50:27| There were some positions that rose to the level of close to 40% behind the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| Victim services advocate, police officer one, senior firefighter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| civil engineering tech, and automotive technician one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| were all positions that were significantly behind the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| And then when we looked at data with respect to time to fill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| typically any job should be filled within a 45-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| If the pay ranges are competitive, you should be able to get a strong applicant pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| and then the interview process, and then signing up the new employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| Typically 45 days you can fill any job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| Some jobs are taking over 60 days to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| because the departments are going back to civil service or HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| and saying what you've sent us with respect to the quality of the applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| they're barely above the minimum qualification standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| and quite frankly, we need better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| And so the plan that we put together is a bold plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| It's an aggressive plan to elevate compensation within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| When I came in, I was introduced to the fact that the city has an ordinance in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| that each year employees receive a 2.5% cost of living adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| And so I asked Dr. Drummond her thoughts as a part of the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3114)|
| 0:52:01| if we recommended increasing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| because inflation is running 5.5% up to a little over 7%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| depending on where you live in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| And if we're going to implement the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| considering that it's been a number of years since a comprehensive study is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| we do not want to see employee gains minimized or reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| because of the current rate of inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| So for this year only, we advocated adding an additional 3.5% to the 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| So this year, for one time only, the cost of living adjustment would be 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| And so as we start doing the calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| we start out by increasing every employee's base pay by the 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| Then we do a review to see what employees are still below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| the minimums of the new structure that we came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| And so we found a significant number of employees across departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| that were still below just the entry level of the new pay structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| So we had to determine what does it take to bring them up to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| So that's the second calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| First is the COLA, the 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| The second calculation is to get those at least to the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| If you're going to have a pay structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| people have to be within the confines of that structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| at least at the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| So we needed to look and identify those that were still behind after the COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| And then after we did that, we ran another analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| to see was there a salary compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| And for those of you who don't know what salary compression is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| that's when you have a large number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| with varying years of tenure making the same thing as someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| or same amount as someone with very little tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| In other words, you can have an employee who's been in that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| four or five years or six or seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| and they're making within a couple hundred dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| of someone who only has a year experience here or two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Then the other things that has been happening in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| is what I like to call a game of leapfrog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| Because the pay structures are so low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| that when you find a qualified applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| and that applicant knows his or her worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| and they want to negotiate, they're going to come at the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| So the department has a choice to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| HR has a choice to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| I've got this critical need in terms of expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| with respect to a position that needs to be filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| We've made an offer at the lower end of the spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| and it's been rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| So what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Do we let this talent walk out the door knowing that we need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| and pray that we find someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Or do we go to a minimally qualified applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| and hope that we can train them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| No, should be the appropriate answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| We want the best applicant available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| And so the department pushes to bring that person in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| above the lower end of the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| What happens when they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| They leapfrog over somebody in a comparable job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| that has been here for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| And so all that becomes a compression of salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| at the lower end of the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| And it needs to be dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| When you have a pay structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| there needs to be employees all along the spectrum of that structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| some at the very beginning, some slightly above it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| some at the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| and some up toward the upper end of that pay structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| So a third calculation was to identify individual employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| who were significantly impacted by salary compression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| come up with a formula based on hire date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| to give them an additional adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| to move them forward within the pay structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Not everyone was in a predicament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| where they needed that additional what we call equity adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| based on time with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| But we had a fair number who did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| And so when we did all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| the financial impact looks like what you see before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| For fire, in order to implement the study, is $1.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| For police, which is hemorrhaging staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| having a difficult time hiring, is $3.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| General government, which has never fared very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| when these types of studies were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| In my estimation, they got the shaft, the last two studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| There's no way that could have been a valid study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| with what was recommended for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| General government is the largest group of people you have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| It is the most diverse group of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| when you look at groups, general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| And general government this time around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| I vowed that we would do it the right way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| and we would make sure those salaries are competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| And so the cost to implement the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| for general government are $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| When we add the three plans together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| we come up with a cost of $8.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| You'll notice there's a disclaimer at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| that says these cost estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| do not include the cost of fringe benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| This is raw salary dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| that go into the pockets of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| This is not the fringe benefit cost added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| That will need to be applied on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| And so in addition to the pay plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| and implementing them and the financial impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| associated with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| there are some additional recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| that came out of the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| and I'm just going to briefly run through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| The first one there says that we created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| three different pay plans from the same statistical tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| And you saw that in the previous slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| We created a pay plan for fire, police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| and a separate one for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| For fire and police, we've created a step-and-grade plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| And I'm sure somebody's probably thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| why would you create a step-and-grade plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| for public safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| For two reasons, recruitment and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Police and fire are paramilitary-type entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| just like the Air Force and the Army and the Marine Corps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| where individuals who go into that occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| are always looking to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| if I commit for the long haul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| if I commit to making this my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| I want to know what the organization's going to pledge to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| with respect to compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| and I want to know what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| And so as we've gone around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| and I've done this in some similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| some larger jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| I'm only a fan of step-and-grade for public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| I do not recommend that for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| So we put together a step plan that has 25 steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| and there's 1.7% increments in between steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| when you move horizontally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| and the range width from step 1 to step 25 is 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| For general government, we've proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| what we call an open-range system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| which is similar to what you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| You have a minimum, a mid, and a max,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| and the spread there from mid to max is 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| All three plans were created and aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| at 100% of the market averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| And here's one of those things when we talk about being bold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| The city of Knoxville should be, must be going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| an organization that joins the $15-an-hour club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| a competitive living wage within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| And so all full-time and permanent part-time positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| we recommend a starting salary no less than $15 per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| I talked about, because of inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| adding the additional 3.5 to the 2.5 mandated COLA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| which gives the one-time 6% this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| What have we been doing or experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| over the past two-plus years as a country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| as a community, and as a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| We've been fighting the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| We've asked employees to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| and continue to perform their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| even when some of them had family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| that had health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| even when they put their health on the line for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| and the citizens that reside in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| They stepped up, they did so without complaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| and continued to deliver sterling service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| And as an acknowledgment of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| as we come out of the dark days of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| we're recommending that every city employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| receive a one-time incentive payment of $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| As I said earlier, the study addresses salary compression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| which was a major issue in general government and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| We've looked at the Fair Labor Standards Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| designations for the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| We've assigned all the jobs to occupational categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| We reviewed benefits such as health insurance and leave time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| and provided recommendations on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| and an overview of what we found in Appendix 2 of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3706)|
| 1:01:54| Another thing that was lacking in the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| that prevented it from being a progressive employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| an employee of choice when it came to public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| it is a normal practice, a prevailing practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| in communities of this size that have a public safety operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| to encourage those men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| to take on additional duty assignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| to pursue extra certifications and licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| For example, in the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| an individual who's a firefighter may have a basic EMT certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| but it behooves the city to encourage that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| to want to become a paramedic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| because that gives you a two-for-one job skill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Rather than having to go out and hire a firefighter and a paramedic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| simply compensate the firefighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| who's gone out and gotten the paramedic certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| In police, field training officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| who are responsible for training the next generation of KPD officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| take on that responsibility, take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| They train for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| They stay abreast of current trends and changes in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| There should be compensation associated for that additional duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| If they do not hold on to that additional duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| then the compensation should be taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| That is why the incentives that we've recommended for police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| would be considered supplements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| As long as they hold the certification or continue to perform the additional duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| they get the additional compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| But if they don't maintain the certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| or no longer want to serve in that additional capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| then the compensation can be taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| Going forward, we have built in a factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| anticipating what will happen in the labor market this coming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| So as a part of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| in terms of making sure that the city maintains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| the competitive nature of the plan that we put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| July 1 of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| the salary ranges need to be increased slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| so that they remain competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| For public safety, we believe in order to remain competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| the annual increase for the public safety personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| should be 4.2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| The general government personnel will continue to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| the 2.5% cost of living adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| One of the other issues that we found that we think has impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| that internal relationships of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| making sure jobs that have equal value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| are in the same grade with the same salary scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| we found that departments can request reclassification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| or reviews of an existing position anytime they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| which puts a great deal of strain on then the civil service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| and going forward, it would put a strain on human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| Quite frankly, in 22 years of doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| and as a former HR director and assistant city manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| I found that 90% of the so-called reclassification requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| are not really reclassification requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| They're more performance-related issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| that should be addressed during the annual performance review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| A reclassification, by definition, is a contextual change to a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| For example, if Russell's a coordinator today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| and supervises no one in the planning department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| but starting next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Russell will be a planning coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| and he will have three staff people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| and along with that comes budgetary responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| disciplinary responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| That's a contextual change to the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| I've seen reclassification requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| where the volume of one's work has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| Administrative assistant or technician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| has gone from producing 10 different documents a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| to producing 20 a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| That's a volume increase, that's not a contextual increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| They should be recognized for the performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| and work productivity through the performance review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| That should not trigger a need to move that job to another grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| So we're recommending that reclassification requests be done once a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| in association with the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| and so they should be done during the month of March or early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| And that gives departments plenty of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| to prepare meaningful requests for reclassifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| in their respective departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| I would be shocked, surprised, and disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| if Dr. Drummond called me in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| Hopefully this will be implemented and, in effect, July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| But she calls me in August and she says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| I've got over two dozen requests for reclassifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| And I would say to her, very quickly, in a very stern voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| that's a bunch of baloney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| There's no way you should be entertaining reclassifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| within the next 12 to 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| because we've turned over every stone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| to make sure these jobs are competitively paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| Unless there's a restructuring in a department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| there should not be a need to do any reclassifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| in the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| The city does have somewhat of a merit or a bonus program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4064)|
| 1:07:53| We're recommending that the city retool that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| make it more progressive, more meaningful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| by implementing a new system that is paperless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| provide training to all staff and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| on how the system works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| provide annual training and information annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| as to results of the survey with the merit program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| in terms of the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| and how departments stacked up against each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| We think it'll take two years to actually do it the right way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| create a new merit pay program that's effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| that people understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| that they believe provides criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| that really measures their job performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| And once that program is created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| we're recommending that the city consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| allowing each department to set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| 1 to 2 percent of its payroll budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| as a pool in each department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| to recognize high-achieving employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| And the last recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| and I've discussed this with Dr. Drum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| because one of the things that I found as I came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| and I looked at the size of the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| and the makeup of the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| and we were made aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| that you're creating this new human resources department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| do not set the department up for failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| by not staffing it appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| When you look at some of the HR matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| the HR department, the newly created HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| will need some additional people and skill sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| to go from being a transactional human resources operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| to one that's a true strategic partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| that can provide council and department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| with forecasts on how the workforce is going to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| over the next five years or the next decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| or how wages are going to grow over the foreseeable future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| what we need to do to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| that our people are embracing technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| and we have an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| that is ready to move into the 21st century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| In order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| you've got to have a strategic HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| with the manpower and the skill set and the tools to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| So I've asked her to take a look at her staffing and her needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| and report that to the appropriate individuals going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| We certainly will stand by to provide guidance and assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| in any way possible as it relates to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| I will say I'd be remiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| if I didn't mention Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| and the other people in HR who work for Dr. Drummond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| who've done a heck of a job of giving us the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| that we needed to do this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| particularly considering that they're a new startup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Oftentimes they had to do research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| and get historical perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| on why certain things were the way they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| And so they all did an exceptional job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| but Michelle was our primary project manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| and she never missed a deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| and always got the information to us accurately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| and when we needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| And so my last comment is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| and please, I hope this doesn't offend anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| but I've never been shy about speaking my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| I told the city manager once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| I said, you can't negotiate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| and I'm ex-military, by the way, Air Force officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| you can't negotiate with terrorists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| you can't negotiate with people about their compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| because everybody has an opinion or view on what they're worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| So this study was forward-looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| We were preparing the study in the present to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| We could not go back and turn back the hands of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| to address discrepancies or inconsistencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| or decisions that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| that impacted people's compensation 5, 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| We tried to clean up as much as we can, and I think we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| but there are some things that will have to be handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| on an individual basis if you're going to make them right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| because the study can't clean up all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| And so I thank you for the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| and the opportunity to work with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| I'll be happy to address any questions that you may have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| And my last slide just talks about going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| In a nutshell, it's asking you to adopt the study as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| the recommendations, and move forward July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| And then as a best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| you're encouraged to do this every 5 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| and we even provided you with a baseline compensation philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| And I would suspect, and if you do hire a management advisory group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| it won't be me because I'll be retiring from consulting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| but if you do this the right way, you follow the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| you adjust the pay schedules each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| you won't see such a large price tag to implement your next study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| This is a result of partial implementation of one of the previous studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| and a lack of a comprehensive study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| Now you have the comprehensive study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| you've got the administrative tools to support it and make it work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| and so when you do this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I wouldn't expect to see such large numbers with respect to implementing the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| Council Member Ryer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Yeah, I'm going to ask the first question right out of the gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| I need clarification on what is proposed for July 1, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4444)|
| 1:14:12| versus July 1, 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| because on page 18 of the presentation packet and a couple other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| this is 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| July of 2022 is to implement the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| adjust the salaries of individuals as we prescribed in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| In 2023, we're not talking about the people, we're talking about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| The plan needs to be adjusted in 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| because the labor market moves forward, wages generally move or increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| so you need to adjust the ranges in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| Okay, so the 6% is the 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| I just needed clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| I don't know if there's anybody here from finance that can answer this for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| or maybe Dr. Drummond, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| David, if you can't, just wing it and get me the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| I'll get you the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| I know that your number said 9 million, excluding fringes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| What percent of compensation is generally the city's cost for fringe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| because that increases the total hit to our budget for 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| That's what the community is going to want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| So is it general 25%, 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| I mean, what kind of percentage on top of the 9 million would we be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| So a good, rough calculation is 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| That's a very conservative way to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| You know that as a banker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| I mean, that's what we do in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| But I think people need to understand that it's not just $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| It's a third more, almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| So it's close to 12 in this fiscal budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| I'm not saying we don't need to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| but let's talk about that will be the hit to the budget for this first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| Really good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| and I think when Mayor Kincannon presented this initial proposal at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| mayor's budget retreat for city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| there was a range, and we're still within that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| But I think that's a great point that cash out doesn't necessarily mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| we're covering all of the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| And so it is a large price tag with that 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| I also think, I mean, as an employer myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| I also think it's I'm really pleased to hear you say that our benefits are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| in line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| because I think a lot of times employees don't truly appreciate the value of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| that other, that's 30% of their compensation as well are the fringes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| I was, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| I was actually surprised to hear that our benefits were in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| And I wondered when doing the study and comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| If we were taking into account our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| you know, lessons learned during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| I know we were able to rely on some federal help to work for employees to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4630)|
| 1:17:18| be able to take paid leave when otherwise they weren't able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| but was that taken into consideration potential need moving forward into a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| you know, COVID reality, the need for more paid leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| We looked and we generally looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| And we looked at that issue specifically in some other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| One of the lingering effects of the pandemic is going to be telework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| People working not a hundred percent of the time in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| And that goes along with what we're seeing in terms of benefit trends or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| benefit changes is more quality of life benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| One of the things that the pandemic has taught a lot of us, me included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| is that you've got to strike a healthy balance between work and life and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| and define what's important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| And so for a lot of people coming out of the pandemic who are searching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| for jobs, they are looking for jobs that will allow them to telework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| And that's an incentive and a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Now not every job in every department can allow people to telework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| but there's some value in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| And we ask or encourage the HR department to look at that strategically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4716)|
| 1:18:44| talk with department heads to see if that's something that makes sense to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| them. Do they see any benefit to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| But that would be the one thing related to the pandemic that I would say you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| If we were to consider, you know, some sort of expanded leave program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| do those tend to have a large financial impact with an initial investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| Well, anytime you afford someone leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| that becomes a liability on the books to the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| So yeah, that was costs associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| How would you include those projections in an analysis if we were to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4754)|
| 1:19:23| That would be something David's probably better suited to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Yeah, I think, well, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| I want to get back and make sure that we're talking about facts with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| So we actually implemented, and Ms. Stickler is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| who runs our employee risk and benefits department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| and then was the acting HR director holding two jobs until we could hire the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| team that's here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| And so we actually implemented a very specific plan for COVID leave there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| where people's existing leave would not be impacted during COVID for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| So we implemented that program and we have the ability very quickly through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| benefits and the administrative rules to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| We also have, we do look at employee leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| We have many employees with significant amounts of built up leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| but if there was a desire for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| and we've looked at this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| how does our leave compare to other communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| We've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| We've made some tweaks and we always are looking at how we're competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| I think the overall analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| it was good to hear that our benefits were in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| And that doesn't mean we can't tweak some areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| but overall we're competitive with our benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| The compensation is the real area of concern right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| People aren't leaving us for better benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| They're leaving us or not coming to us because of what we pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| And I think Russell, that's a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| That is an accurate statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| The other question I had was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| I realized with the creation of the HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| we've made some changes to the functions of our civil service merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4854)|
| 1:21:01| and the compensation and classification is no longer under the civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| But I do realize they still have a role to play under the charter that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| is linked to the compensation and classification plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| And I heard mention of a need to update administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| To have better processes in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| Are you recommending also that those changes would clarify within those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4889)|
| 1:21:37| rules, what that role of the civil service merit board is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| or did your study take into account their role within the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| No, we did not address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| That is an internal issue that the city I'm sure will address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| but that was not as part of scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| For this plan to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| we would need to come to council with changes to ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| And then the mayor would also need to change the administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| where obviously the mayor has said this many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| I've said this many times, 100% merit protections for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| But we also want to have a very robust and professional HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| That's why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| And so when, again, we're in, this is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| It's an incremental process where we will continue to work with council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| and with the employee groups and with the law department to fashion what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| needs to come before as we work through the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| So the mayor still has budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| We still have obviously a first reading for the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| and then there's legislative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| So this again will be an incremental process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| but there will need to be code changes and administrative rule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| And we'll work with law on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| And the class comp plan is part of those admin rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| I would also just urge that if the city does move forward with assessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| the needs and capacity of the HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| that we are also taking some time to look at the changes that are made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| the civil service and making sure that they have the capacity to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| fulfilling their charter responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| And those charter responsibilities are incredibly important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| and we're supportive of that as an administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| And we actually have MTAS that was actually involved in helping us look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5008)|
| 1:23:38| how other municipalities are structured with the merit protections like we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| We're pretty unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| And so we are looking into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| and we will work with Dr. Hatfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| And so, yeah, we'll move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| Good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| I think that the three things that were most important to me were that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| addressed the fire compression issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| There's a unique challenge, as we all know, to recruit police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| So paying them better helps us all around as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| And then the $15 an hour starting wage, I think, for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| has been referred to as a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| But I think over the past couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| it's become a competitive requirement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| Pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| We had a discussion earlier this year about people who want to work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| city, and I think that particularly plays into us being an example of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| the city values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| And so if you want to work with the city, that's not a specific requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| but I think we set an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| So I applaud you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| I have a few questions about general government and a couple specific to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| I'll take a pause and let some of my colleagues weigh in and come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| Total compensation, obviously we talked about the 30% increase for fringe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| A lot of your analysis included, well, all of your analysis included public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| cities, municipalities, but I think you had an indice that you incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| That wasn't extended to fringe benefits or health insurance or those type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| I saw a survey was in there, and I think that was your way of assessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| those fringe benefits as it relates to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| Yeah, we did not use any private sector benefit data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| We only used wages from the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| The public sector organizations, we did wages and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| My only kind of, maybe this is just wishful thinking, but it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| comprehensive view, but the only changes that were based on competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| data were related to the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| I understand that other data is hard to come by, and I understand you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| It's not necessarily a whole picture of how our employees are paid total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| I think you called it, total reward in Section 4 compared to the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| For an engineer, maybe it's even worse compared to the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| than another public sector opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| It may be impossible, but it just is not the full picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| Based on what we do have to work with, one of the things that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| recommended in here was related to merit or performance-based bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| I think 1%, 2% was referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| Would that be of the existing budget each year, or would that be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| incremental to today's budget for engineering or other departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| We currently have, for general government employees, for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| departments, Uniformed Bodies does not have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| They've requested not to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| So general government has a half of 1% of their budget, where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| leadership of that department has flexibility to reward performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| So it's a relatively small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| I think what our professional MAG organization has recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| is that ought to go up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| If you really want to reward performance, that should go up from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| a half of 1% to either 1% or 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| We're analyzing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| There's a fiscal impact, and so that is not included in these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| The current budget proposal we're putting together includes the half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| right now, but we have not gone up any further from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| Just for general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| Just for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| Again, police and fire, based on their model of rank and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| structure, have always felt like that was very divisive and was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| necessarily a good tool, but I can tell you that as a former director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| of large departments at the city, that's invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| I hear oftentimes, operate like the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| We try to do that in many ways, but we don't have the same reward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| tools to reward performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| That's been a nice tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Actually, I worked with Ms. Hatfield several years ago to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| integrate that into the system, along with some equity adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| and a few more tools within our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| I'm not an HR professional, but coming from the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| and having merit-based pay associated with most of my employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| there are, I would say, from the public safety perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| should also be considered for general government as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| So while it's a good tool, there are tradeoffs about culture, morale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| competitive, individualism, those types of things, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| are not limited to public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| It's a tradeoff and a risk, and I would suggest it adds excessive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| complexity to what we've all heard today, which is quite a complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| algorithm of rewarding people for their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| So not a knock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| I'm just saying you get a tradeoff when you add more individualized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| bonuses and it adds complexity to the overall system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| So just something I've noticed being performance-based for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| And just a brief philosophical comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5356)|
| 1:29:23| The true intent of performance reviews is not necessarily to top hay to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5363)|
| 1:29:30| The gist of performance reviews is to use it as a career development tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| where you acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| prescribe specific measures by which they can compensate for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| deficiencies or weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| The fact that we top hay to it should be secondary to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| I appreciated the distinction regarding that related to career ladder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| versus what it was versus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| But, yeah, there's a different dynamic there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| but there's tradeoffs associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| One quick point on that, and I'm not sure if Harold Cannon is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| but I think Mr. Cannon, who came from the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| one of the biggest challenges he had was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| and I've worked in the private sector myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| the ability to cultivate and develop especially really high performers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| You can do that through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| maybe buying lunch where the company buys the lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| or maybe there's an annual trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| And, you know, we don't have any of those tools at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| We have a lot of stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| We have other benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| That's why people want to work in the public sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| plus a commitment to service and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| But I think that I would argue very adamantly that that small amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| I agree, as a tradeoff, has been really important for the directors like Chad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| and Nick and Susan with our finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| I know Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| But we'll have to weigh that, obviously, with the downsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| We have a 2.5% employee wage increase every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| And it's my understanding that that was put in place largely to mitigate things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| like inflation spikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| So for the past 10, 20 years, wages have increased higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| sometimes two, three times the inflation for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| The inflation we're experiencing right now, while severe and real,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| if you average that over the past 10 or 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| it seems like we'd be ahead, although feeling an immediate pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| So talk a little bit about how you apply the 6% recommendation associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5489)|
| 1:31:37| with the current inflation pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| It's like a stock market investment over the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| We've been ahead of inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| Well, first of all, the 2.5%, how did you come up with the 2.5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| Because if you really want to tie the cost of living adjustment to the true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| cost of living from the employee perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| you would be benchmarking the cost of living to the Employment Cost Index,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| which is the ECI, which is calculated by the Federal Department of Labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| And it is a measure of the cost of increased compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| and the increased cost in benefits from the standpoint of the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| So if you really wanted to do it that way, you'd benchmark it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| And if you go back and look at the last four years, it's been running over 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| It's about 2.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| Okay, for the last four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Yeah, 2.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| All right, and then I have a couple questions specific to fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| One of the things that I heard first when I joined council was that there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| lack of incentive for career development specifically related to EMT, AEMT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| where there are incentives but it's not worth as much as the cost it is to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| firefighter to go get those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| So I appreciated that addition because I know that's critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| and I think you mentioned it serves two purposes or serves two functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| One of the things I've also learned is that the sick time that firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| accrue is unique, I think, compared to other city employees in terms of not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| necessarily how they accrue it but how many have to be accrued before they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| be used, how it relates to retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| It creates a mess of sorts or some really complicated dynamic associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| firefighters' time related to sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| So I didn't see that addressed in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Mr. Brace, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| So there is a program where uniformed bodies can accrue a certain amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| sick time and then use that time at the end of their career towards retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5624)|
| 1:33:51| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| It's complicated, and it's pretty complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| and so we did not get into that with this assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| We did not get into the nuture of how it's calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| What we did when we look at that, we look at it from a standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| what's the annual number of vacation time the organization provides fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| police, and general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| One thing that we have been discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| and I'm glad that Mr. Faddis has done his homework and is continuing to push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| this request that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| It's complicated, and we've worked on it with Mr. Faddis for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| and I think it needs to be looked at in a very comprehensive view because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| think how do we attract the next generation of firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| and is our current paid leave, sick, and vacation the best model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| It may be the best model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| I think what I've heard from police and firefighters is it's difficult to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| folks to work beyond normal hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Newer folks really value their time off, and so do we need to do a full assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| It was not part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| Again, at some point you've got to draw the boundaries in getting in to define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| benefit pensions and how we do our sick time buyout at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| At some point you've got to draw the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| and so that was not something we dug into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| Okay, two more quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Dr. Drummond, how much have employees received during the pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| I know there was a hero pay bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| There were others, but can you talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| I know there's a reference to a specific bonus related to the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| but talk about what's already been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| I don't have the exact figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| We did a hero pay component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| This payment is essentially a retention payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| the one that has been recommended by MAG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5740)|
| 1:35:46| Employees have been surged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| I worked with our Deputy Finance Director, Boyce Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| and he has said that from his experience managing large groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| you can surge for six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| and we've been surging for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| And so we really need a carrot to keep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| especially our police officers and firefighters here and all of our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| but right now especially police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| And so what we hope and believe this plan does is that it provides optimism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5769)|
| 1:36:16| and some cash in folks' pockets to stay through June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| and then see the benefits of this so we can continue to grow the numbers in our police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| maintain the numbers in the fire service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| and then we've got to get our public service department, public works back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| We're getting to the breaking point on services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| So I can get counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| I'm going to write that down and say I'll get a summary of everything we did during the COVID period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| It's a little foggy right now, but we'll get that unless Erin's got it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| I have it for 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| So this is a fiscal year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Yeah, so we'll get it with the right qualifiers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| But so when we were looking at this in September last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| we paid out a total of $1,000 average to fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| and then general government apparently was an average of $500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| and we have the total cost of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| And we want to add to that anything that was done more recently through recent budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| Yeah, what we'll do, I've written down, provide basically the last two fiscal years, current, previous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| what have we paid out, and I'll just say bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| I mean it may have been framed slightly differently, the HERO pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| but we'll get that to counsel in an e-mail and to Will so you've got that info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| Okay, last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| And on the sick leave, I'll get some more details on what the current program is as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| so everybody understands it because I don't have that in front of me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| Mr. Campbell, one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| Did you evaluate our turnover rate or attrition rate for the city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| and if they left did they go to another public institution or private sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5875)|
| 1:38:02| That was one of the factors that we looked at when we were designing the new compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| Particularly in police, the pay was driving the turnover in most cases, and also in general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5888)|
| 1:38:16| The fire didn't have as much turnover, very minimal in fact in fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| but, yes, it was a driver in general government and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| Did you compare it to the other municipalities that are in the study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| Thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| Counsel Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| First of all, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| I'll reiterate what my colleagues have said, that this is a very well done report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| I know it takes a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| I really appreciate a lot of the analysis and dialogue around culture, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| so I commend all of you for the time invested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| Going back a little bit to Council Member Fugate's question, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| salary increases, 30% fringe, a little bit of what we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| Again, there are things that compound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| There's overtime pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| There's payroll tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| There are all of those things that will escalate as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| A little bit about incentive pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| First of all, around education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| My understanding is there is already some incentive pay that includes education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| I've heard 7.5% or some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| So I just want some clarification about the one-time incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| Is that just for new hires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| Is that for everyone within APD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| Yeah, let's talk about so right now we do not, besides the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| we do not have a comprehensive education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| We have a tuition reimbursement, but there's no one policy that guides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| If David Brace gets an associate's degree and it's not required for my job, what do I get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| So there become these kind of negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| Some people may get a slight bump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Some may not, and it's messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| So what MAG has recommended is that across the city we have an education incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| associates, undergraduate bachelor's degree, and a master's degree, and that those be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| There would be a one-time to individuals when they achieve that accomplishment to their base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6025)|
| 1:40:31| but it's not for folks if that's required for their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| If an undergraduate degree is required for your job, that incentive does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| It's not retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| So this would be from this point forward anyone that achieves that and it's not required for their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| then that would be an incentive to their base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| There is a current program that I don't have all of the historical details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| It was back when Mayor Asch was here and Chief Keith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| where police officers received an annual 7.5% on to their base every year for their degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6055)|
| 1:41:03| And so anyone in that program now, we are proposing that they be grandfathered in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| and that moving forward we would have this new model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| That model is not necessarily a sustainable or equitable model when compared to fire and general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| So we're saying one program for all city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| If you're in the old program, you would stay in that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| and then we can get it all, what I'll say, tidied up into a single incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| And I'm not sure if you want to elaborate on the benefits to that for education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| but that's where we're at now and what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| So that's just moving forward and it's not in addition to those who are already receiving that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| No, if you're in the 7.5 program, you'll stay in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| If you've started your education right now and you started it at KPD under that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| with approval from your supervisors, then you would be in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| But upon adoption of this, assuming there is adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| there would be a new education incentive for all employees, general government, fire, and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| Okay, thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| I have a couple of questions that Dr. Drummond, I think, will probably be better served offline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| But I did want to ask on the pay ranges, the minimum, the mid, the max,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6136)|
| 1:42:24| sort of based on and what the new proposal of that range is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| can you sort of give some clarity around if you're starting at the minimum, how that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| I mean, there's the STEP program, obviously, that's being proposed for first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| but I'm just curious how, like at what point does that minimum start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| you start to move into the mid to the max?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| What does that timeline sort of look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| Well, if I could take a shot at that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| What you're asking is how does an employee progress through the salary range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| Roughly a typical organization, probably 70 to 75 percent of the people you hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| and your pay ranges are competitive enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| you're going to get them somewhere around the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| assuming they meet the minimum qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| There will be some folks that you want to hire who have credentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| education experience that exceed the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| and that's when the policy kicks in, the provision that talks about hiring rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| so that you apply that equally, maybe up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| maybe they can be brought in up to 10 or 12 percent above the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| if they have credentials that exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| But the majority of the people will be brought in at the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| In government, there's only two vehicles by which someone can move from the bottom of the range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| toward the middle and the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| That's through the COLA and any type of bonus that's applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| One of the things that has been done administratively that has created the salary compression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6226)|
| 1:43:54| is in the past, whatever you did for the COLA, 2.5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| current employees will get the 2.5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| but then you raise the range by the same 2.5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| So they never went anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| If you were at the bottom and you got 2 percent and the range went up 2 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| you were going to stay at the same juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| So schematically, you've got to manage how you administer the range adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| So if you're going to do the 2.5 percent cost of living adjustment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| and I think the recommendation says only move the range maybe 1.5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| that will allow current employees theoretically to move an extra 1 percent through the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| And then when you get to the merit program, that will help further move them within the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6272)|
| 1:44:38| But there are not a lot of tools in the toolkit when it comes to salary progression in local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6278)|
| 1:44:45| other than cost of living and some type of merit incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| Are those municipalities that are part of the comparables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| are they doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Are they raising that range below the COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| When they're enlightened to the benefits of it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| A lot of people just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| Compensation is a very narrow field in human resources administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| on human resources management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| And so often, most HR departments, when leadership changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| it's just usually status quo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| unless you have someone who's really dived into the schematics of compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| compensation management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| to realize that there is no one tool or one approach that's going to address all the issues around pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6330)|
| 1:45:37| You've got to be creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| You've got to look at ways within the constraints that you work with to achieve whatever end you're trying to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6339)|
| 1:45:46| And so it becomes administratively important to understand that through the policies to help manage...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6346)|
| 1:45:54| Your biggest asset is your current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| Those that may come are an unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| So we've got to make sure that we have policies in place that help move our existing employees through the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| Now, someone once asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| well, Russell, if I came in at the minimum, reasonably speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| how long should it take before I got to the middle of my pay range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| Well, in theory, it should take about seven or eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| And I say that based on the fact that I've never seen a job that couldn't be mastered within seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| where someone's pretty proficient at what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| And so when you think about compensation and you look at the pay range itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| if you broke it down in a particular occupational group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| probably 15% of the people in an occupational group are going to be paid somewhere around the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| They're new to that career field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| But the majority of people are going to be paid somewhere around that midpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| probably two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| And those are not people that are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| Those are people that are proficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| Their performance meets expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| And they're senior people who know what they're doing, and they do it the way it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| So probably two-thirds are going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| The remaining 17%, 18% are going to be up toward the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| That's some good clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| To what my colleague talked about between career path and career ladder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| I have a lot of energy on learning and development with my day team and really creating opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6434)|
| 1:47:22| I'm just curious, how are we budgeting for learning and development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| Sort of our philosophy as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| Well, again, this goes back to my recommendation about the HR department doing an assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| One of the things that is really exciting right now is organizations that have gone to an e-learning platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| where employees at their leisure, at home, at the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| they can pull up modules on different subjects and enhance their skill sets rather than having to sit in a classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6469)|
| 1:47:58| you know, three or four hours to get that type of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| And so that's one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| And then the other thing, a career ladder is beneficial when you have a particular occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6484)|
| 1:48:12| or job where it's proven that if someone gains an additional certification or license or skill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6492)|
| 1:48:21| it merits more pay within that classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| So you see something like that, and you have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| Maybe you have a mechanic one who's just a basic mechanic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| but then maybe you have a mechanic two who can work on diesel equipment, which is more advanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| Then maybe you have a mechanic three who can do electric vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| So it's the same occupation but different skills within that occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| Those are career ladders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Career pathing is something different, and this is one of the things that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| as the HR department develops and evolves, they'll be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| But let's say, for example, I came to work here in the city as a customer service rep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| but I'm going to school, I'm working on a degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| and ultimately I'd like to be in middle management in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| Well, under career pathing, I should be able to pull up a career path plan that shows me what skills that I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6545)|
| 1:49:15| in education to navigate from customer service all the way over to finance as an accountant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6555)|
| 1:49:22| or a deputy finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| So it's showing employees, if you want to stay with the city long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| and you have aspirations moving beyond your current job in your current department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| here's your track, here's your career path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| It takes a lot of detail work to put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| Right. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| And I just wanted to elaborate on how we're approaching that from creating those opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6579)|
| 1:49:48| regardless of the path you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| I think what Russell will allude to, it really depends on your culture and your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| And I can say that I know the creation of an HR department, staffing it, providing resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| and then hiring the right leaders who value career development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| And then you've got a budget for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| I think over the last five years, we've started to increase employee training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| the line item in that, in small increments in different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| But it really is about who's at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| I know an American candidate said she wants to be the employer of choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| and we want to be the model employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| And so part of that is making sure you retain, develop, and attract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| Attract, develop, and retain those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| So looking back to KPD and the proposed police incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| just kind of going down the list for annual supplements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| For instance, like I see violent crimes, and this is anybody in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| this is fully support that, but for their incentive pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| But I also know there are other specialized interagency departments, be it organized crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6655)|
| 1:51:03| be it Internet crimes against children, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| And just curious why, you know, for those other specialized units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| that incentive pay does not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| Well, there has to be a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| That is not a closed-ended document or recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| It can be expanded or modified going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| But based on information that we've gotten from the police department and HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| we thought those were appropriate certifications to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| Yeah, just to jump in and dovetail into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| So MAG highly recommended incentives within uniformed bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| and an education incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| They gave us a bit of a laundry list, and so MAG, HR, myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| sat down with uniformed bodies and talked about where not only the leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| but the representative for that body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| and they really provided deeper perspective on incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| But this is a starting point, and these can be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| One advantage to, again, embedding class comp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| which has always been its own piece within HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| is to be able to tweak these and to be able to adjust these as the market changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| Or as we see higher demand in one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| maybe we need to incent folks to go into that specialty area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| So it was a collaboration, but it was highly recommended by MAG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| and then details hammered out with the groups on what they really valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| and where they saw a need in the community for their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| I just know a lot of those departments are very interdependent on each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| in order to do, so that just stuck out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| and a question that I wanted to question and have consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6765)|
| 1:52:53| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| A lot of my questions have been asked by my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| but first let me say, Mr. Campbell, thank you for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| Very comprehensive and very detailed in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| My first question goes back to slide 15 where you said after the 6%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| there would still be a few positions that would be below entry level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| Do you have an estimate of what percentage that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| Do we have a guesstimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6801)|
| 1:53:35| We can get you those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| I'd be interested to hear what percentage that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| and in what category those percentages fall in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| I think it would be very important for us to have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| We can do it on the fly if you'd like, or we can get it to you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| They know the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| They've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| Because I think it's important for us to know that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6844)|
| 1:54:13| While that's being calculated, let me just move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| and we can circle back to that if I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| But I was glad to hear you mention inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| Even though we know that right now inflation is at a 40-year high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| we don't know what the future looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| So to know that we have dedicated employees, police, fire, government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| and service that have been working diligently for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| and some folks grossly underpaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| I really have a lot of respect and appreciation for our men and women in uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6883)|
| 1:54:50| Today really hit home to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| When we talk about COVID, and this is going back to incentive pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| in the workforce, all of us were impacted by COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| Let's say that our police, fire, and service, it hit harder for you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6903)|
| 1:55:10| because not only are you working mandatory overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| that's time away from your families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| That's stressful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| It's an increase in violent crimes and overdoses that you all have to deal with up close and personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| And time, you cannot get that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| And so the level of stress, not just that you experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| but that your family members experience also because of your time away from your families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| I definitely understand the incentive pay and why that was recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| even though I know that we've done some hero pay as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| But it takes a lot to run a city, and it takes people who are dedicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| And I feel that we are very fortunate as a city that we do have people that are dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| that still continue to come to work day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| And I'm sure most of you guys are tired, but you keep moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| and you keep providing services to us and our citizens in a very professional way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| I think that with the inflation and given the fact that the years that have been worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| where some people may be the only person that's only income in their family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| I do think that this would be a good gesture on behalf of the city to make us an employer of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| because it's all about how we treat our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| And so, again, I think this is very eye-opening today on a lot of levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6993)|
| 1:56:38| So I just wanted to put that out there that it's about investing in our people, and I fully support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=6998)|
| 1:56:46| Councilman McKenzie, let me make sure I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| You ask what does it cost to bring each group up to their minimum, the new minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| Well, what percentage were still going to be below entry level if these things are implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7016)|
| 1:57:05| So when we look at FHIR, it will take to get them to adjust to the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| it will be 161 individuals with the new minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| For police, to get them to the new minimum, it will be 296 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| And to get, for general government, it will be 247 individuals to get them to the new minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7041)|
| 1:57:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| I'm trying to understand the higher end of the salary scale, the higher earning members of the city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7056)|
| 1:57:48| You're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| Did your study find that, you know, the compensation was an issue with retention at those higher pay levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7074)|
| 1:58:03| It's an issue at all levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| The lower level hourly paid-in people, middle management, not so much so at senior management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7087)|
| 1:58:14| but the lower level hourly and the middle management and the technical skilled craft jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| those are the people that primarily lead because of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| I did have some concern with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7105)|
| 1:58:31| individuals at the higher levels receiving an automatic increase in pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| And I still have, you know, I've started reading through the compensation study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| but I still have more to read through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| But that's one thing I wanted to get a sense of is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7124)|
| 1:58:49| folks at the top end of the scale, how they were comparing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| to other cities and whether an increase would help with retention or if that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| Well, when we did the market survey, we gathered and used what we call a family of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7139)|
| 1:59:05| We looked at clerical, technical, IT, middle management and senior management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7145)|
| 1:59:10| when we developed the new pay ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| I'm a big advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| As much as you can do for one group, you should do for all the groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| and not pit one group of employees against another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| What you're paying here for compensation for the senior management people is not outlandish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| It's not the highest that we've seen by no stretch of the imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| And so what we put together is competitive ranges across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| Like I said, we're not going to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| Like I said, we weren't trying to replicate the highest end of the market averages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| from any one organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| We took a composite average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| And what we came back with speaks to what it takes to get you in line with the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7189)|
| 1:59:55| but not break the bank, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| So I don't see any issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Recently, reports have come out that show Knoxville has one of the largest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7201)|
| 2:00:08| fastest-growing gaps in wage between the higher-earning wage earners in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| and the lower-earning wage earners in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| That gap is where the third in the country for the fastest-growing gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7216)|
| 2:00:22| between those two income groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| And so I know compression was an issue with looking at this salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| But I didn't know if the reverse were true in looking at whether there is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7231)|
| 2:00:38| and, in fact, with public service, it was more clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| because you outlined the step plan with public service to ensure that there wasn't a wide range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7243)|
| 2:00:50| between the top-income earners and the lower-income earners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| But in terms of general government, I'm trying to get a better understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| Once we set a minimum pay of $15 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| what's that range look like between the lowest earners in government and the top earners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7261)|
| 2:01:06| We didn't do any type of analysis on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| If you want to get us the study you have, it would be nice to see those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| Sure, I'll send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| The Bloomberg study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| The final thing that I wanted to say is, you know, I do have some questions that I've raised tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7279)|
| 2:01:29| But overall, I really appreciate the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| I really appreciate your presentation. It was very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| And I'm a huge supporter of raising the salary of city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7295)|
| 2:01:44| and it's something that I ran on when I ran for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| So I have a lot of support for implementing the results at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7307)|
| 2:01:55| How it's implemented, we might have differences, but I'm in full support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7315)|
| 2:02:04| One of my concerns, though, and I'm going to continue reading the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| is that I'm not fully convinced that this answers our recruitment retention problem in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7328)|
| 2:02:18| And, you know, we've had multiple items come before us in the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7338)|
| 2:02:27| and city councils before us that looked at ways to increase our recruitment efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7347)|
| 2:02:36| And we've continued to fall short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| And I think that we're going to have to commit to really looking internally at some of our departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7359)|
| 2:02:50| and some of the concerns that are coming out of those departments and interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| And I'm not speaking to you. Obviously, this may be a little awkward for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| I'm not speaking to you, but speaking in general, that beyond this compensation study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| we still have work to do as a city to ensure we have healthy working environments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| that are able to retain our good staff that we have in place. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7388)|
| 2:03:15| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| Yeah. So I just wanted to clarify one more point from the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| in the classification and compensation study final report, not the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| So in that, it's recommending a $2,000 incentive pay in the 2022 ending fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7409)|
| 2:03:41| Okay. So should we be expecting a budget amendment? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| I just wanted to clarify that because I had an employee ask me about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| and I want to make sure I give the right information out and everyone understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| So the recommendations of the plan, if implemented, are $2,000 bonus across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| in fiscal year ending 2022, and then 6% raise across the board for classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| Can I also clarify that? Like, it's important to acknowledge council members are not part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7447)|
| 2:04:15| Yeah, that's a really good point. Let me answer your first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| Who's not covered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| Yeah, let me answer your first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| So we're talking about the $2,000. The recommendation is that there be an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| MAG did not say when you should do it, how you should budget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| So the feedback we have received from police and fire is that some type of six-month retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7469)|
| 2:04:36| because people have been strained until this plan can be implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| getting something in would be really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| So one model would be we pay this out of the current fiscal year 2022 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| That would require a budget amendment to come before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| So that could be the best way to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| but we are still developing the approach and the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| and anything like that would need to come before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| The question about who is not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| So Mr. Swanson, the city law director is here, and if you want details on this, or Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7505)|
| 2:05:12| So the compensation for council members and for the mayor has very specific rules around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7512)|
| 2:05:18| which it has to – it actually would never take effect until the next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| so that it's a fail-safe to prevent people from voting on their own salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| And so council and the mayor are not included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| Okay. But everyone else that gets a city paycheck is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| Everyone else was included in the analysis and the studies, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| Okay. Just not the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| Good point. So we did not include – so we have some temporary part-time people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| like think of lifeguards, referees, officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| but there is a separate proposal that Parks and Rec has put in through the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| Actually, I met with Ms. Ely today about some of those wages are $8 or $9 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| We're not able to get lifeguards, referees, officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| So that will also be analyzed separately from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| But, yes, all employees, but not temporary part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| Okay. Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| I've got a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| Mr. Campbell, on page 13 of the presentation, we see more of a lag in the entry or at the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7580)|
| 2:06:29| and you said that in your remarks that 5% is a big warning sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| Unfortunately, you get higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| I don't know what alarm bells are going to start going off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| So we have 5% is we're starting to have some real problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| We're over 10% there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| But then following up on some of my colleagues' questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| specifically I look at police officer recruit, and that's significantly higher than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| I think it's – if I can read small print – I think it's at 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| Can you tell the folks watching at home what – if that isn't changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| what kind of impact they're going to see in the ability to retain and recruit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7631)|
| 2:07:17| Because I think that what I saw in the report was at the entry level positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| we really see a lot of lag, just like you show there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| Well, you know, it's a pretty known fact that nationally police recruitment and retention is a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7647)|
| 2:07:36| Many people, many officers have retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| Some have decided to go into other careers and professions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| And make no mistake about it, the officer you put on the street, not only is that a representative of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7664)|
| 2:07:51| but there's huge liability if you put someone on there who's a marginal officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| And so if you want to be able to put the very best and brightest officers on the street in the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7676)|
| 2:08:05| then you're going to have to pay a competitive wage for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| That's to get them into the door for the training and then get the rank structure to where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| as they advance through the rank structure, they're seeing a noticeable pay adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| And so it behooves the city to move, to implement the structure as we've proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7700)|
| 2:08:27| to make sure that you do have the right caliber of person representing the city in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7707)|
| 2:08:34| I would assume, then, that if you stay at the current situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| we don't make some significant adjustments here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| then there would be a very serious implication to the service that is being provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| You're going to have a very difficult time finding the individuals with the skill set, the background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7727)|
| 2:08:54| the psychological profile that you need to be a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| You're going to have a difficult time not only bringing in new folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| but you're going to have a difficult time retaining because a lot of folks are talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| when I get my time in, I'm gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| And that's going to have a domino effect down the rank structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| And this question might be better suited for Mr. Brace, but just in talking with employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7755)|
| 2:09:23| I'm glad you addressed the education incentive issue because that was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| But I also heard some comments about current longevity pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| Would that also be grandfathered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| At this point, we have not changed any of the current longevity program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| That stays completely in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| Anyone who's in an existing longevity program, they're going to stay in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| It's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| Folks that are in it now and at this point, we're not recommending changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| And so anyone coming in would still have that existing longevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7793)|
| 2:09:58| And I know especially when you look at the steps and when we're, I think it was on page 52,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7798)|
| 2:10:07| the police steps, you know, you see a massive wall of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| And so one of the questions I had was or had received was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| can we expect some charts in the future where it will be a little easier to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7816)|
| 2:10:21| Yeah, we've actually talked about that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| and I know that we're going to continue to work to make sure that compensation is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7824)|
| 2:10:31| How do we make it very user-friendly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| Because communications on the back end is just as important, if not more important, once we implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| And so we're going to get with Ms. Farley and the policy team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| and we'll figure out how to make these very user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| But, again, this is incremental, so we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| But that is one message we've heard from fire, police, and general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| is it's a little confusing, so we've got to make sure it's easy to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| Yeah, definitely making sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| uniformed services can look at that chart and really see what they're going to be expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| That would be a big help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| I told them the COO had to be able to understand it, so it should be down pretty low on the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| There was reference to hiring more human resource staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| How many human resource department staff have been budgeted for currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7879)|
| 2:11:30| We currently have a total of six, and that includes me and the other five people that's behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7890)|
| 2:11:40| So we have a full team of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| Mr. Campbell, there are 25 steps in each of the parts in the step classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7905)|
| 2:11:57| Is that indicative of a number of years that it will take to go from entry to max?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7917)|
| 2:12:03| I mean, I guess that was another one of the questions I had, which I think will be helped with the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| Yeah, that's reflective of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7930)|
| 2:12:11| So it would take you from entry to meeting the max 25 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7931)|
| 2:12:17| Unless you've got some raises outside the guaranteed raises that are built in, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7937)|
| 2:12:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| Just a very quick point on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Those ranges need to be adjusted, and so I know sometimes employees have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| I can't ever get the max, you don't want to get the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| That always needs to be adjusted based on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| And so if we're doing our job, HR, and we're bringing in an expert every five years to help us stay competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7958)|
| 2:12:44| those should be raised, but it is years, 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| Well, I guess one thing that would be helpful for council to look at is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| what is the current time frame from going from entry to max?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| And I don't know if there's a statistic on that, but Dr. Drummond, if you could help us with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7978)|
| 2:13:04| because we certainly wouldn't want to make that change different than it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7984)|
| 2:13:10| The current system is in place, is set up to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7990)|
| 2:13:16| but they really think it takes 25 to 30 years to get to max at the current rate that is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=7996)|
| 2:13:26| And looking at page 15 of the presentation today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| that's the page where we look at the 6% cost of living adjustment increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8011)|
| 2:13:38| I think it's important to note that that is, I guess, a one-time increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8018)|
| 2:13:45| but its ramifications would proceed after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| You're not going to see, this is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| so we're not talking about a one-time investment of, you know, $9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| or, you know, plus the 30% for benefits that we've already had a discussion about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| This is a long-term approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| The 8.9 is the annualized cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| So it's reoccurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| It's reoccurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8050)|
| 2:14:20| I think that I wanted to thank you for the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| and for the very detailed discussion that we've had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| Mayor Kincannon, I understand you wanted to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| I just want to say that the City of Knoxville, we have a lot of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| We have a lot of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| We spend a lot of money on equipment and fuel and paying for our electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| But as Mr. Campbell stated and as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| our most important resource is the people who work for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| A lot of them are here today, and I think I appreciate their turning out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| A lot of them are watching on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| And when I first took office, compensation was a huge priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| and I wanted to address it my first year as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| Other events interceded and prevented that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| So I'm committed to putting compensation at the forefront of my budget proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| and not just doing it in a Band-Aid way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| but doing it in a comprehensive way that fixes it and fixes compression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| and fixes the issues with inflation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| and gives our current employees hope that they're going to get fairly paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8129)|
| 2:15:34| according to the services and expectations of the people we serve every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| So I really appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| I didn't want to just roll it into a budget proposal willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| We needed the study to know where we were and where the gaps are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| And now we know, and we've got a lot of gaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| and the biggest gaps aren't in benefits, although we need to keep watching those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| It's not in equipment and capital things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| It's in compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| So thank you for funding the study, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| Thank you and the HR team for getting it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| I look forward to council members' input and support on compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| as we move forward with the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| That's it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220303?start=8173)|
