| 0:11:03| a temporary ceasefire that we have seen recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=663)|

| 0:13:22| the Palestinian people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=802)|

| 0:17:34| So I don't know who Craig Pickett Jr. is, but what I do know is Craig Pickett Jr. ain't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| from the poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Craig Pickett Jr. ain't from the lower income community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| Craig Pickett Jr. ain't from the struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Craig Pickett Jr. is probably going to make decisions that are going to cost me more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| in my light bill that's already too damn high in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| And so I say for the final time, start thinking about the decisions you all are making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| This room has tension all over it because of the decisions you're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| India started this thing, but guess what's going to happen tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| We're going to finish it and I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| Council members, that concludes people who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| Oh, someone else signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| That concludes people who have signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| There was a commitment to, um, when we discussed a charter change for KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1102)|
| 0:18:32| the charter change did not move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| but I believe the administration committed to appointing a low-income board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1114)|
| 0:18:42| I can't remember what the commitment was to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| but would you mind reminding us what the administration's position is on KUB board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| The commitment is that all the board members that I nominate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| will make sure that equity is an important part of what they consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| as they determine their issues on the board, and Craig Cricket is no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| All the members of the KUB board that I have interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| and brought to this board for their approval, which have all been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| have taken that into account since that time and even before that time, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| We also committed to having a standing committee of community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| who are actively meeting with KUB leadership all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| to share information to KUB's leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| and also receive information out about resources for people to help pay their utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| I continue to feel that we need that representation on KUB board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| a seat at the table, that decision-making power, more so than just an advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| So that would be my encouragement is that we start to see some candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| that come before us for a vote that can reflect that experience on the KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| I believe that's a really reasonable expectation from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| Well, as I said, the nominees tonight and my nominees and approved board members in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| do represent that lens and that perspective very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| I'm really grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1221)|

| 0:21:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1274)|

| 0:21:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| I voted against this the last time and plan to vote against it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| Last time when we spoke about this, I didn't get a chance to talk about Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| I was just kind of dismayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| We had a public meeting, a public presentation by the disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1296)|
| 0:21:44| by the firm hired to do the disparity study for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1304)|
| 0:21:53| I asked why we didn't have a workshop, and they said they were denied a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| So myself and Gwen were the only council members who were at this disparity study presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| so I believe we were the only two who were able to get an understanding of where we were lacking in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| One of the major concerns was the amount of resources that we're putting towards it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1331)|
| 0:22:19| When I was first elected, it was clear from the community's perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| that we needed more resources dedicated to our anti-discrimination work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| That was one of my first asks, that we increase staff availability in our Title VI office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| Now we have no Title VI office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| That's been moved to HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| We need additional staffing to coordinate and to implement the Title VI program here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1363)|
| 0:22:55| Now we have essentially all of our other civil rights obligations also being added to the plate of our HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1375)|
| 0:23:07| All of them, all civil rights obligations, and these include both personnel and external.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| I'm quite disappointed and discouraged by how this will impact our ability to not only uphold our responsibilities under civil rights law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1395)|
| 0:23:40| but to be a proactive advocate for equality in our city when we're overloading city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1420)|
| 0:23:51| and not including those staff members who have served in these leadership roles on these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1431)|
| 0:23:59| who've been the experts in our city, not involving them in helping to design this new proposal that's moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| It seems everything's just getting kicked over to this one department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1447)|
| 0:24:17| No additional resources that I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| No additional commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| It shows a lack of commitment to anti-discrimination efforts, and it concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1462)|
| 0:24:34| We're in the midst of a budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| I know the community is coming together and determining what their budget priorities are that they can present to the city, to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1477)|
| 0:24:47| City council members are meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| Departments are discussing what their budget priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| We need additional resources for our anti-discrimination work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| We cannot just funnel it all into one department without having the adequate resources or the people in place who know the work, who really understand the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1500)|
| 0:25:17| Personnel issues, I have no question that Dr. Drummond knows what she's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| We are now loading up on her more than what she's qualified to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| That may be an HR decision for the mayor, but it's coming before us because we as a council have to determine whether city dollars are being used fairly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1531)|
| 0:25:50| efficiently, in a way that will actually reach our goals as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| In this situation, I do not believe that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| I look forward to hearing more of what commitments are going to be made to increasing our capacity to address these anti-discrimination issues, which we continue to be sued over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1558)|
| 0:26:11| Just got sued over disability issues within KPD, and they won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| We can put money towards legal expenses, or we can put money towards our staff and do the work right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you. Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| I would like to call on Dr. Drummond to help provide some clarification around...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1588)|
| 0:26:37| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Dr. Drummond, if you could come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1599)|
| 0:26:48| I would like to ask if you could provide some clarification around the consolidation of these responsibilities, as well as your expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1608)|
| 0:27:00| as well as the tools and resources that will now be able to be allocated to elevate our policies and speak to this issue of Title VI and other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1620)|
| 0:27:15| Dr. Kelly Drummond, Director of Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| As a director, I have received specific training on Title VI, ADA, and on EEO issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1639)|
| 0:27:29| So specifically, I am trained and I have a certification to be able to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| As we look at individuals within my staff, I have currently five HR generalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| One of them has already been trained specifically on ADA issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| Depending on the results of this vote here, the remaining four will get trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| And as we look at this, we will work in conjunction with the ADA coordinator, who we've already spoken to regarding these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1674)|
| 0:28:03| and talked to her actually earlier this summer about coordinating efforts to ensure that ADA receives what they need to increase services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1683)|
| 0:28:16| When it comes specifically to Title VI, we will continue under my leadership to increase services, to look at compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1696)|
| 0:28:25| and to ensure that we're meeting all of the needs on an issue of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| I'm working with the TDOT already to look at different services that can be offered and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1710)|

| 0:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| I had some concerns in the last reading about the lack of ground for retail opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| but in speaking with planning staff and looking at it a little closely, I plan to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| I think that there's an opportunity for retail in the future as committed by the developer, so I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| You need to turn your mic on, the little button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| You didn't keep it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| We got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| For the third time, I almost also have similar concerns as Mr. Smith did about the lack of retail on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| I think that was kind of a thing that we've been moving toward as we built newer structures in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1947)|
| 0:32:35| Ms. Brooks, could you kind of elaborate on that and what the Planning Commission's feeling is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| And also, if we pass this, what would be the opportunity, even though he may not be required to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| the developer would add such retail on the ground floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Amy Brooks, Knox-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| The Planning Commission did vote in favor of this rezoning, as you all know, to let it move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| The comments of the Planning Commission centered around that it still allows for mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| Additional housing would activate the site that is currently underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| There's quite a bit of discussion around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| And they also made note that anything proposed on this site would go before the Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| Those concerns did cite similar things that you all just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| which was the need for this street to have more street level activation and commercial uses on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| But they did say that that's still a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| So the zone that they have requested still allows for them to do mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| It just doesn't require it on the first floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| And Ms. Brooks, this is directed to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| And so when these requests are made, such as this one, it is specific to this particular property, to the specific property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| So any of these types of requests will come before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| So there will be an opportunity if there are some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| But, again, I don't think that we should limit a property because we do have quite a bit of retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| And so I think that's what makes downtown unique is just the different variations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| But it's good to know that we do have the channels in place that regulate that and bring it before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Yeah, I would just add, just generally speaking, that's something that I think we should move toward is more retail on new buildings at the storefront level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2073)|
| 0:34:41| I think all of us that frequent downtown realize what an amenity it is when you've got housing up above, but then you've got retail on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2081)|
| 0:34:51| It makes a much more lively place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| So I'm not necessarily going to oppose this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| But in the future, I think generally the current should be in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2103)|

| 0:43:58| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| Because of our recent newsworthy event where we had an employee of the Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| Department indicted on federal charges in this particular area, the timing of this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2649)|
| 0:44:18| request is not odd, but I guess it's timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| I'd like, just from the little bit that I read on the resolution, I would like for Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| Noel or any other police department personnel present that might have some input on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| to kind of flesh this out so that people can understand what this grant is about, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2679)|
| 0:44:49| it entails, what the obligations of KPD in terms of training, what type of personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| is it going to, to what level, personnel level is this going to reach within the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2696)|
| 0:45:05| We always end up coming up with this situation where we have something happen, and at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| last minute, there seems to be some type of corrective action involving a grant or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| training, and it's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| And I want to thank everybody for coming out tonight just because we hardly ever see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| kind of crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| So now y'all are witnessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Because if you didn't know this, just up to this point, they've given away a whole bunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| of property to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| We've got a housing crisis going on, and it's a, dare I say, a racket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| But I'd like to hear some comment from someone, preferably Chief Noel, as he referenced the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2751)|
| 0:46:01| whole indictment situation that still haven't gotten word about what you guys really knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| about what was going on inside your department with a command sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| You said it was horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| So how is this going to make the KPD better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| How is it going to make children in Knoxville or hell, in the southeast region of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2785)|
| 0:46:34| safer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Next person is Constance Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Ms. Everett, you can come to the podium, state your name and address, and you'll have up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2805)|
| 0:46:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Y'all knew I was going to sign up for this initiative because it's going to have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| the elephant in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| As Rick said, thank you all for showing up, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| We come to these meetings day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| And you see how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Y'all are worried about a geopolitical issue, and that's cool, but there are issues in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| impacting every last one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| We just talked about KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| There's a lot of us that can't afford KUB right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| I'm sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| So the reality is that, as Rick has highlighted before, the concern is that, one, we had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| officer federally charged for child predatorial behavior from a DA out of Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| But there's a second one, since we're talking about TBI and David Rouse, who used to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| the KPD police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Did you know about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Oh, let's talk about the nepotism that's obviously tied to this funding situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| The other concern we have is that, shout-out to Representative Sam McKenzie for calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| for Knox County Sheriff's accountability, who just beat up a black man, a manager of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Starbucks, and recently just had all the charges dropped because the representative called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| for the release of the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| How ironic that when we start calling for accountability, we start seeing charges dropped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| but then we continue to fund these police initiatives without true accountability of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| either department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Now, in all fairness, for both governing bodies, the city and the county, to some extent, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| does not solely fall on your shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| That's a Charm Alley issue, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| However, you are accountable as this elected body to say something out loud about these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| type of concerns and issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| And I'm with Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| You know, we've got to address the other elephant in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Shout-out to Push Black, a black media outlet who recently reported, did you know, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| that you're one of the cop city sites in America?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| I told you all that when they took over the hospital site, that that was going to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| a cop city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| And how ironic a black media outlet has recently reported that Knoxville, Tennessee, holds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| a cop city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| But here's my favorite part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| How does that help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| And more importantly, who's watching them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| I watch cops zip and run all down through the streets, committing all kinds of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| violations all day, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Y'all have still not settled the issue of Andy Thompson Jr. and his murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| You have still not addressed Brooklyn Bell and her racism, or matter of fact, the known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| documented racism throughout the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Chief Paul Noel, when he came in, he has an all-white staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| Does that convince me that he's doing the DEI of diversity inclusion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| But then the irony, as I said before, is that David Rouse used to be the police chief of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| Knoxville, and now he's the director of TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| And I don't find it to be a coincidence of any form that he's getting $130,000 of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| taxpayers' money to come to his department, but to serve a criminal justice program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| But the problem is that the department is corrupted itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| What are you all doing up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Like, let's be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| What are you doing up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| Legitimately, why are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Because if you're not going to hold them accountable and then tell us to trust the police who kill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| us too, who choke us out too, who brutalize us too, who's trained by the Israel police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| forces that come back and beat up black and brown communities too, then what are you talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| So we've got to keep it real now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| We've got to have a real conversation about what's happening in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| And the corruption is rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| You enforce it, you influence it, and then you turn around and reward it by funding it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| I cannot express enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| This is why, voters, you have to pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| You all vote based off your feelings and never off the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3009)|

| 0:50:41| 11F is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Young Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| Animal Center of East Tennessee to lease part of the facility located at 913 East 5th Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| for an amount not to exceed $1 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| Yes, can you share more information about intended plans for this type of collaboration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3062)|
| 0:51:15| Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3075)|
| 0:51:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| So this is something that will allow the Knoxville Police Department and Knoxville Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| to focus on our core mission, which is law enforcement and providing quality police services to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| Sheriff Spangler and I have spoken about this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| We both fully support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| This is both going to be better for both of our agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| What this is going to do is going to centralize animal control, care, and welfare to an agency, Young Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| that's an expert in providing those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| There's going to be no reduction in law enforcement capacity at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| The Knoxville Police Department currently employs nine sworn professional staff that provide these services on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3115)|
| 0:52:04| Those employees will either have the option to go work for Young Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| or we will find them comparable jobs within the city of Knoxville and the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3128)|
| 0:52:17| I saw it's two agenda items forward, but the $3 million for Young Williams said that there would be a reduction in three full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3137)|
| 0:52:31| Four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| A Boy 7 CFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| What's going to happen is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Right now you've got eight animal control KPD civilian employees that perform the animal control services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3161)|
| 0:52:54| Once we do this, four of them will go elsewhere within KPD, and then the other four will essentially be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3174)|
| 0:53:08| The budget positions will be eliminated as we go through the FY25 budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| Those will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| If we were to have concerning incidents in our neighborhoods between pet owners and violations of our animal care ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3198)|
| 0:53:33| I guess I'm talking back to the chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| it would now be the responsibility of Young Williams to engage in those disputes in our neighborhoods and not KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3216)|
| 0:53:47| So calls of animal control issues, animal welfare, will go to Young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| Just like now, they go to our nine sworn animal control officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Law enforcement would still get involved, just as we do now, if there's allegations of criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| So right now, the non-sworn animal control officers that we have can't investigate state crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| So if there's an allegation of a state crime, law enforcement would have to get involved now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| And under this agreement, they still would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Most of the calls that we handle do not involve state crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| They involve animal welfare issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| And so the lease that's before us, can you explain more about what that lease would allow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3264)|
| 0:54:35| I could jump into that. David Brace, chief of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| So currently, the animal control team utilizes a space at Fifth Avenue, which is where it's that former building over by the cat facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3278)|
| 0:54:48| And so this lease is to allow Young Williams to continue to use that exact space for their use to run that operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3288)|
| 0:54:57| So imagine right now that unit runs out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| Those vehicles, the space at the building will then be transferred in a lease over to Young Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| and their operation will run out of that facility for a dollar a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| And so that is what the lease is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| And they will handle day-to-day maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Any major structural issues will be handled by the city, like most of our nonprofit leases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| like the work we do with Iams Nature Center or other nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| Well, is there a plan to, is there a commitment from Young Williams that they will commit resources that will make up for not having eight officers dedicated to this, but only four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3324)|
| 0:55:47| Council Member Testerman, you know, in your capacity as executive director of Young Williams, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3347)|
| 0:55:56| So we will actually, we have budgeted 17 positions, which is the number that is consolidated with the city and the county currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3356)|
| 0:56:06| So collectively, that is the number of positions that are budgeted for this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3366)|
| 0:56:15| Just one point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| So Chief Noel made the decision and discussed this with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| The full eight positions essentially are being reduced, and those resources transferred in the agreement to Young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| Chief Noel has asked to retain four civilian positions that he would utilize in other ways in civilian roles at KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3390)|
| 0:56:38| So we've gone from eight to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| That is one reason that there's some added cost to the city in the agreement with Young Williams was a decision to use those civilians to help fight crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3400)|
| 0:56:49| Council Member Parker, I'm going to move on to Council Member McKenzie, and if you still have further questions when she's done, keep your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Chief Noel, I know we spoke, but I don't think that I asked you this specific scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| In the event that I know people are very passionate about their animals, but I know that there are some situations where animals do have to be removed from an owner, from the pet owner's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3427)|
| 0:57:17| In that event, would that still fall under Young Williams going forward if this is approved, or would KPD be engaged if it starts to escalate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3437)|
| 0:57:29| So law enforcement would have to get involved any time we're forcibly removing property from an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| Law enforcement would still have to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Again, that really doesn't change from what we're doing now because we have non-sworn personnel that are doing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| So any time that we have something where law enforcement would have to get involved, I need to bring one of my uniformed officers in to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3464)|
| 0:57:52| So any time, if there's duties that cannot be done by my current animal control, non-sworn, then law enforcement has to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3472)|
| 0:58:00| Same thing under this new agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| If Young Williams cannot legally perform a duty, law enforcement would have to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Chief Noel, is there any, or Mr. Evans, is there any additional cost to taxpayers with this agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Once we get into the annual contract amount, it'll be a net increased cost of what we currently pay for animal control services of $123,810.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3501)|
| 0:58:40| And in terms of oversight, Chief Noel, will the Animal Control Board still be intact and have the same authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3520)|
| 0:58:48| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| The Animal Control Board essentially becomes an appeal board now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| So Young Williams would perform the work that KPD was doing, right, again, and I was looking at just the bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3535)|
| 0:59:03| So all the things that the current officers that are civilian officers do, when there's a time and they need to get a warrant to enter someone's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3543)|
| 0:59:13| seize an animal, seize an animal against the owner's permission, charge anyone with a crime, they're going to reach out to law enforcement, sworn law enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| And so, but the Animal Control Board does change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| They're not going to issue permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| It's going to be much more streamlined, but they become an appeal should someone disagree with Young Williams on their permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| which I think a lot of people that have to get these permits will be appreciative of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| The Animal Control Board will act as that administrative court on appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| They'll meet quarterly or when a permit application requests it, they can request it as an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| The Animal Control Board will still advise the mayor as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| There is a shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| There was one board member that was a KPD Animal Control Unit officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| Now that that unit will be, again, pending your approval, will be disbanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| That will become an at-large position appointed by the mayor to still have that representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| So hopefully that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Yeah, and just to repeat, Mr. Evans, you said it was $120,000 net increase to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| It will be $123,810 increase in the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| In other words, yeah, what we need to appropriate to provide the Young Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| In other words, if you take the total cost of the $628,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| you subtract out what we currently provide in animal control dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| you end up with a net increase of $123,810.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| I do want to add to that there is an initial upfront, what I'll call capital, of $166,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| that Young Williams will need to buy radios, convert over some vehicle wraps, laptops, desktops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| So there's an initial $166,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Then there's the amount that Mr. Evans, the $123,000 above and beyond what we pay now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| A portion of that, by the way, is adding about $10,000 to the starting salary for those officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| Right now that entry-level position is $36,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| That's going to be bumped up to $46,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| So there will be higher paid officers, again, $46,000 compared to $36,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| And there's going to be 17 folks for the whole city and the county together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| So there's not a reduction in the number of officers in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| It maintains its constancy, and they're paid a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| Not all of that money, but a big chunk of it is increased salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| You mentioned the appeal responsibility of the Animal Control Board in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| Is that what it currently is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| How does a resident appeal an animal control decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| I would have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| So right now they go directly to the board to get permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| I'm not as well versed on it, but let's say there's a big reptile event at the convention center, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| That event has to go and get a permit when the Animal Control Board meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| Now they'll be able to go to the Young Williams, get their reptile permit for the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| Should it be denied, they could then appeal to the board as an administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| and they can always then seek injunctive relief through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| I think at that point, Mr. Swanson, but I'm out of my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Mr. Swanson, if you could respond to that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| You are absolutely correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| If they're dissatisfied with the decision of the board, then they have their rights under the law to appeal to a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3744)|
| 1:02:31| And that was for a permit, the scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| Stay as far away from reptiles as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| But I think the main question I had is if a resident has an issue or an appeal with something that the animal control officer does or rules, how do they appeal now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3757)|
| 1:02:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| The Animal Control Board will continue to advise the mayor and this council with regard to issues related to animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3768)|
| 1:03:00| I think it will directly be advising the mayor because they have had a lot of trouble being able to meet as a board because there's a lot of folks with expertise on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3780)|
| 1:03:11| And they seem to be unable to get together in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| If we have them advising the mayor, not the mayor and the council, then they are not subject to the open meetings record requirements that say they can't meet virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3795)|
| 1:03:25| So in order to avoid that problem, so they can meet more often and can meet virtually, they will be principally advising the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| But they will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| When folks still have problems with animal control issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| If a resident receives a fine related to an animal, where do they appeal that now if they disagree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3816)|
| 1:03:44| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| If a resident receives a fine associated with an animal, where do they appeal that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| Oh, they go to city court now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| And that won't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Ultimately, if somebody gets cited, they still are going to end up going to city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| That was what I was after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| I just wanted to add a little clarification on the animal control board as I've served on it for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| Largely, the purview of that board is to approve permits like hen permits, goat grazing, pigs, that type of thing, exhibits that involve animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3847)|
| 1:04:17| There's never been virtually animal control goes and makes sure that certain specifications outlined in the ordinances are accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3857)|
| 1:04:26| say for number of hens and that kind of thing, and exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| So nothing in my time has been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| There's also other things that the animal control board has worked on, like establishing guidelines and standards for pet retailers in the city, which there are three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3876)|
| 1:04:48| So those are other responsibilities that the board has essentially taken on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| But for the most part, it's been a permit approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3893)|
| 1:05:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Council Member Precker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| So we've heard about multiple responsibilities that will have to remain with KPD, and they'll have to continue responding to some calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3907)|
| 1:05:18| What are the calls that will be taken off the KPD's plate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| Chief Newell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| Normal calls about animal control, animal welfare, just like now that my non-sworn animal control officers handle, those calls will be handled by Young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3924)|
| 1:05:34| We will continue to engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Our law enforcement will continue to engage when there's an allegation of a state crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| Let me stop you there because you've been very clear about when KPD will engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| But just saying animal welfare calls we won't engage in is not clear to me because some of those could trigger some of those other issues that you raised, like an animal needing to be removed, some state law issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3950)|
| 1:06:07| So specifically, day-to-day work of our animal control officers, what work that they do day-to-day will they no longer be engaged in through the City of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3967)|
| 1:06:21| The duties of our animal control officers now, those duties will be handled by Young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| Yes, and I'm asking specifically what those duties are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| Calls about animal welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| What specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| An animal potentially being neglected, any type of animal welfare call, animal in distress, dog loose or an animal loose on the street, an animal looks like it's emaciated and not being properly cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=3994)|
| 1:06:48| That's what our animal control officers do now, and those calls will be handled by Young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| The examples that you've given to me all speak to issues that could come back to KPD once investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4014)|
| 1:07:02| So I'm really struggling to see how this removes work from KPD's plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| If it's an animal welfare issue and they have to be removed, well, let me ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| If there's an animal welfare issue that needs to be investigated to determine whether that animal will be removed, is that investigation to be conducted by Young Williams or KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4037)|
| 1:07:29| So the answer to hypothetical is very difficult here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| Our animal control, non-sworn animal control officers handle an overwhelming majority of those calls now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4053)|
| 1:07:41| If they determine through looking at the scene that there is likelihood of a state criminal act, then law enforcement would get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4061)|
| 1:07:53| Our animal control officers, just like Young Williams, will have the ability to issue municipal citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| If a municipal citation needs to be issued, law enforcement does not get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| I have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| My main concern, though, is the continued consolidation of decision-making power into the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4089)|
| 1:08:22| I don't like this move that disconnects the Animal Control Board from City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| When we will continue to be the ones to set policy and to pass ordinances that deal with animal care issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4110)|
| 1:08:41| So for only the mayor to be advised by the Animal Control Board, which will now not meet very regularly or be as transparent, not have be obligated to be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4121)|
| 1:08:58| I have very real concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| And so I don't believe I'll be able to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| Just as a reminder, the item you're voting on is item F about the leasing part of the facility on 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4145)|
| 1:09:13| Council Member Fugett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| I'm going to call the question on the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| All those in favor for calling for the question on item 11 F, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Then we'll vote on item 11 F, back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Motion carries 7-0 abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| 7-0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| 6, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| 6-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| Resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Young Williams Animal Center of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| to lease animal control equipment and vehicles for an amount not to exceed $1 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| Motion is approved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| From an expense perspective, these are the existing vehicles that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| What is the plan for replacement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Like when the vehicles wear out, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| That will be on Young Williams' responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| They'll be, you know, responsible for fueling them and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Ms. Tesserman, did you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| So I'll directly ask Ms. Tesserman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Ms. Tesserman, what's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| What's the equipment replacement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Do you know how long these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| I have no idea what the service life is left of the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| Do you plan on fundraising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| How do you plan on covering them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| There are currently multiple years with these vehicles, and we do have budgeted some allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4255)|
| 1:11:05| So, for instance, none of the trucks now have heat and air, so that causes more frequent trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| In the back for the animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Correct, for the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| So ultimately, we would like to retire, you know, maybe a truck a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| To that point, to invest in vehicles that are equipped and customized with heat and air, that type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4281)|
| 1:11:29| so they can stay in the field longer and more efficient vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| So, yeah, I mean, part of that, I mean, it's, you know, it's an equipment lease with the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| Again, the city and the county, the equipment is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| But part of the agreement, you know, is budgeted to help, what am I trying to say, to help upgrade the trucks over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4303)|
| 1:12:02| Some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4322)|

| 1:14:13| Mayor, I'd like to introduce this agenda item, if that works for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4453)|
| 1:14:24| There is one person signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Mr. Roach, in favor of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4467)|
| 1:14:36| I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| Can we get some explanation again, some clarification on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| If you're being asked to petition the congressional delegation to not support their bill, and it has to do with broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4494)|
| 1:15:13| and we're right now in a situation where, you know, we're doing a real big switch with our broadband system, KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4513)|
| 1:15:28| doing a pretty decent job from all accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| But some explanation as to how this is going to affect future plans for expansion and provisioning of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4532)|
| 1:15:42| and who's really going to have say-so in terms of responding to the needs of the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4542)|
| 1:15:55| I'd like to hear from all of you guys, you know, because right now, between the private providers and now KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4555)|
| 1:16:07| we've got a situation where, you know, KUB's got this new thing going on, this new revenue source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4567)|
| 1:16:18| and, you know, it's not going to be cheap forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| It's not going to be the lowest price gain in town forever as far as broadband services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| You know, especially if you guys are going to have purview, the city council's going to have purview over what that's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4587)|
| 1:16:37| So, you know, maybe we can get some explanation, clarification on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| Council, that concludes people who signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| As the city council representative on the Knoxville Community Media Board, formerly CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4610)|
| 1:16:57| we've been asked to help generate an overwhelming amount of support from the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4617)|
| 1:17:07| in support of our CTV staff or KCM staff, I should say, who are traveling to D.C. in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4627)|
| 1:17:15| to lobby for the Protect Community Television Act and to lobby against the American Broadband Deployment Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4635)|
| 1:17:30| I wanted to bring this before city council because it was requested to bring it before city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4650)|
| 1:17:38| because we passed the resolution in support of the Protecting Community Television Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| and our amazing staff members from CTV traveled to D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| And what they were told in their meetings was that they needed to bring more support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| a show of more support from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| And so CTV staff have a petition on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| You can go to ctvknox.org or you can go to knoxcm.org, same website, and sign the petition as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4687)|
| 1:18:18| But they also would like a resolution from the council of the city of Knoxville to show that we also have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| as a legislative body about what this act could mean for our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4705)|
| 1:18:33| and for our ability as a legislative body to continue to have the oversight we have over land and zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4713)|
| 1:18:45| The American Broadband Deployment Act would limit our ability to regulate certain land uses and zoning issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4725)|
| 1:18:56| as it pertains to cable franchise activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4736)|
| 1:19:04| I know that we've had multiple members of council who have, I think multiple members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| hopefully multiple members who have already offered up a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Our mayor has written a letter in support of not supporting the American Broadband Deployment Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4753)|
| 1:19:25| And I hope that we can take this action tonight to show our support as a council so that our staff members are able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4765)|
| 1:19:36| our city employees who work for CTV are able to go to D.C. this December confidently with letters in hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4776)|
| 1:19:48| with petition signatures in hand, and with resolutions in hand that show our city's unified support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| of the Protect Community Television Act and our opposition to the American Broadband Deployment Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4797)|
| 1:20:04| So I would appreciate if you all would support this resolution tonight and we can send it along with CTV staff in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4804)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| With that, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| And I'd like to move that we approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4821)|
| 1:20:28| Motion's been made on item 11K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| I am interested in this, but I don't have a lot of knowledge and information yet about what this encompasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4837)|
| 1:20:45| It sounds like something that we should be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| I haven't had a chance to talk with anybody from CTV to see how that might affect them or KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| So, yes, I don't feel informed enough right now to take a position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| Council Member Thomas, Law Director Swanson has some information to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| Let me just explain it in short layperson terms, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| This proposed act is an act that is being proposed by the lobbyists for the big cable companies who are trying to save themselves some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4875)|
| 1:21:25| One of the ways they're trying to save themselves money is to never have to pay any franchise fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| Right now, we are financing our community television facilities and operations through those franchise fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4891)|
| 1:21:43| They want those franchise fees to go away because they don't want to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| And we think they provide a real service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| We don't want to lose those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| This is one way we could lose those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| And so, generally, as a city, we are opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| And that's just the simple truth of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| It's just an advocacy on behalf of big companies to keep from paying money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4920)|
| 1:22:07| and advocacy on our behalf to try to reserve to ourselves the opportunity to provide community television and do the many great things that it does here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4927)|
| 1:22:19| And just to reinforce everybody's knowledge, I already did send a letter on this exact issue asking our congressman to oppose this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4939)|
| 1:22:29| and to support an alternative bill that's more favorable to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Also, I have had several people inform me that there's been some technical issues with the Knoxville community media stream right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| and I just want to let everybody know we have alerted them and they are working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| Councilmember Ryder and then Mackenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Did we not vote on something in June that mirrored this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| Someone from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| I thought that was my understanding from my conversations with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4983)|
| 1:23:12| That was the Protect Community Television Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| So the petition that CTV has on their website wants people to sign in favor of the Protect Community Television Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=4995)|
| 1:23:23| and in opposition to this American Broadband Deployment Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| Which are two different acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| How do the acts differ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| Well, I can't really go through it with you specifically, but I can tell you the problems with the American Broadband Deployment Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5014)|
| 1:23:43| I guess, Councilmember Ryder, you're saying that council passed a resolution in favor of something that supports Knoxville community media in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5023)|
| 1:23:52| and I think that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| The names of the bills...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| They're two different bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| So what we passed in June is not the same as what is up for voting on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5038)|
| 1:24:05| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| Not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| Councilmember Mackenzie and then Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| And so just to be clear, the Knoxville congressional delegation, for those watching and those in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5054)|
| 1:24:21| would that just be specific to Congressman Burchett or would that also include Blackburn, Hagerty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5061)|
| 1:24:31| You're asking me about Councilmember Parker's resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| Yeah, I think that Ms. Parker...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| It looks like it's on the House side, but I didn't write it and I don't know what her intentions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5078)|
| 1:24:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| So just to be clear, Councilwoman Parker, do you confirm that this would be going to Congressman Burchett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| My question was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Sounds to me like the two different...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| One was for something and this one is opposed to something, but both of them are about supporting community TV, which we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5106)|
| 1:25:16| The mayor's done and we all know Congressman Burchett's address ourself and can send and I will send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5116)|
| 1:25:29| So I just wonder about the necessity of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| And, Councilwoman Parker, when you said they asked, was it the media board that asked you to bring this resolution to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5134)|
| 1:25:44| It was a request made by CTV staff during a board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| So CTV staff asked this resolution to come before Council, but none of them have talked to us, but they've only talked to you about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5150)|
| 1:26:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| I haven't been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| No one from the organization has spoken to me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| So I just wondered, did the board take action and ask Council to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| But it sounds like it was just staff that mentioned it at a board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5173)|
| 1:26:22| I would have to review our minutes to see if we voted on the actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| Is Ms. McAnally here, Fiona McAnally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| So I'm just trying to get clarity on the question I asked a few moments ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| It is my understanding what we voted on in June was brought by the administration because Paige Travis, who works for the city and is also on the community television board, brought that as a result of concerns from their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5207)|
| 1:27:08| Do I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Fiona McAnally, Director of Government Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| I honestly would have to go back and review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| I don't remember the specifics of what you passed in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| That rings a bell with me now that you bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| That was a resolution I wrote and introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| The one in June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| But Ms. Travis is on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Mr. Johnson, I believe we passed a resolution supporting CTV or community television in I think it was June 23rd of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5264)|
| 1:27:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| I'm pulling that up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5279)|
| 1:28:07| Do you have any further comments or questions while he's pulling that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| To the best of my recollection, and obviously Mr. Johnson is looking it up, I think we already did pass this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| The mayor has already sent a letter about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| I think individual members can send letters about it if they'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| I think, you know, any negotiations that are going on on behalf of the city to this, obviously we've already expressed our desire to support community television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5303)|
| 1:28:33| We should support community television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| So I don't really find this resolution necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| We have already taken action on this and they have everything they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| Go ahead, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| On June 13, 2023, council adopted a resolution expressing support of and protecting Community Television Act, HR 907 of the 118th U.S. Congress, to clarify that franchise fees are only monetary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5326)|
| 1:29:04| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| Is anyone from CTV here that we could ask some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| Is anyone from Knoxville Community Media present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| No, I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| The main person leading on this is out with a dying pet this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| I had a conversation several weeks ago with someone from CTV and they were expressing their deep concern about this act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5365)|
| 1:29:38| I haven't heard from them back since, but so I did have a conversation from someone directly from CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5378)|
| 1:29:48| In light of what Attorney Swanson said and the fact that I have had a conversation with someone from CTV expressing concern about this House bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5388)|
| 1:30:07| I know we may have already expressed a certain amount of support, but I'm struggling with why we shouldn't go ahead and add this to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5407)|
| 1:30:17| I think it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| It is a local issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| It does affect Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| I'm open to what my council people say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| I'm also wondering if maybe we should postpone it for two weeks until we can look more into it and talk with perhaps KUB and CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5427)|
| 1:30:38| So those are my thoughts right now, but I'm certainly open to what my other council members think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5438)|
| 1:30:49| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| I'll go back to Council Member Smith after you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| I appreciate the comments of Council Member Thomas and agree that I don't see any harm in us going forward and passing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5457)|
| 1:31:09| As was clarified by Mr. Johnson, the Protect Community Television Act was about franchise fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5469)|
| 1:31:19| This act is about land regulations, zoning regulations, even more pertinent to our role as city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5479)|
| 1:31:30| So I think it's really important that we as the legislative body add our voices to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| It's already been written, introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| It would be much easier for us to pass this tonight than for us all to take individual actions following this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5499)|
| 1:31:49| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| I just want to add, Mr. Oaks reached out to me a few weeks ago and I sent my letter in to Congress representatives in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5511)|
| 1:32:02| So it seems duplicative to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| If our colleagues want a couple of weeks to consider it and dig into it, it sounds like there's confusion around what we have passed and haven't passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5525)|
| 1:32:12| I personally supported this on my own accord at the request of Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5532)|
| 1:32:21| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| Point of clarification to Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| So did you support it, this bill, this H.R. 3557, the American Broadband Act of 2023, you supported it or you opposed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5549)|
| 1:32:44| I supported the, I'm getting confused now, but I supported the request made by Community Television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5564)|
| 1:32:52| To oppose it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Because you said, okay, because it came off as if you supported this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| And I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| I supported Community Television on my own as advocacy because I felt it was important to do so as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| And so just to be clear, we all know that, you know, this would be symbolic for us just to, as a body, if we decided to vote in favor of opposing this House bill, this House resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5591)|
| 1:33:28| because we know what the House composition is and that the odds of it not passing are slim to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5608)|
| 1:33:37| But I do think that it makes a difference when we do make a stand and at least send our voices individually and collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5617)|
| 1:33:48| Council Member Parker does serve as council's representative on the CTV board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| And so with that said, with her, you know, bringing this back to council at their request, I think should not necessarily be questioned, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5635)|
| 1:34:06| because we did, you know, have her to become to be our representative on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| And so with that said, I'm not opposed to collectively sending something to Congressman Burchett, opposing it as well as individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5651)|
| 1:34:25| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5665)|
| 1:34:32| Sorry, I think I'll be voting in favor of this for discussions that have already taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=5672)|

| 1:43:42| and actively support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Several weeks ago, I did contact Mayor Kincannon about the statement she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| made saying that Knoxville stands with Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| And she met with a group of us, myself and several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6235)|
| 1:44:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| And I explained to her and she listened to us as I explained how standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| with Israel while it was collectively punishing the Palestinian people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| made us feel dehumanized and devalued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| And I appreciate you there, after making a new statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| expressing support or sympathy over the loss of both Palestinian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| and Israeli lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| But since that time, we've seen many more weeks of indiscriminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| bombings, of collective punishment, of siege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| leading to the deaths of thousands more civilians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| the displacement of at least 1.7 million people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| and the destruction of at least half of the homes in Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| More children have been killed in Gaza in the past 53 days than children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| have been killed in all other conflict zones annually since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| And so our conscience demands that our city do more than express sympathy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| over the loss of innocent lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| We must do what is within our power to try to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| And I know many of you are asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| what does this have to do with the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| So I want to spend my remaining time telling you three reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| why it's something that the Knoxville City Council should care about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| and should act on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| The first is so that you are on the right side of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| So that when our children and our children's children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| and our children's grandchildren ask us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| what did we do to stop the ethnic cleansing and the genocide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| of the Palestinian people, we can tell them without shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| And please know that we are not being hyperbolic by calling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| ethnic cleansing and genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| These are the words of hundreds of genocide scholars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| who say that what is happening in Gaza today is either genocide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| or will become genocide if it is not stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| And so we have a moral duty to oppose violence that is actively taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6344)|
| 1:45:51| The second reason why you should care and act on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| is for the trust and the credibility of your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| You heard Hassan say that almost 70% of Americans demand a ceasefire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| or support a ceasefire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| But instead of reflecting what the people want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| our president has literally scoffed at the idea of a ceasefire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| Here in Knoxville, you mentioned dozens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| several families have lost dozens of their family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| We want to know that you do care about our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| and that you do value the lives of all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| And third, in passing this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| you would join the growing list of cities who have passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| similar ceasefire resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| Cities as diverse as Detroit, Atlanta, Akron, Ohio, Providence, Rhode Island,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| Carbo, North Carolina, just to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| By joining this growing list, you will motivate and inspire more cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| and citizens to call for a stop to the war,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| a stop to violence against civilians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| and a stop to the seemingly endless suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| Because whatever our detractors say, we are not motivated by hate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| The people here and elsewhere in support of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| represent a diversity of religions, backgrounds, and perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| But we come together as Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| and as Americans motivated by a desire for peace and justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| No nation state has impunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| Israel has vowed to continue the fighting once this current pause is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| And we want you all to make a statement expressing support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| We want you to join people around the world demanding a ceasefire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| Please be our voice and vote in favor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| Thank you. Next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| The third and final person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6458)|
| 1:47:47| If you could state your name and address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| Go ahead, start the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| Start the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6473)|

| 1:48:05| The clock has started. You're taking time out from your speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| Can we please reset the time, Mayor Kucinich?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| I'll reset the time when people are quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| The time is waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Please stop. Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| I ask everyone to please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| Hey, hey. Everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| Please quiet down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| I ask everyone to please be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| Members of the audience, please quiet down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| If you cannot be quiet, we will ask you to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| If you cannot be quiet, we'll ask you to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| I would ask the speaker, we'll reset the clock to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Please start speaking and people will listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| If you cannot be quiet, you will be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| Please start by stating your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| My name is Rachel and I live in 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| I'm also a lifetime member of the Knoxville Jewish community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| I grew up at Heskamuna where I was a bat mitzvah tutor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| Audience members, please be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| And a Sunday school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| I was a camp counselor at the Arnstein Jewish Community Center for seven summers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| And as an adult, I most recently served on the KJA board from 2019 to 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6551)|
| 1:49:18| Growing up Jewish here in Knoxville not only gave me a spiritual home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| it also instilled within me powerful values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| All of you instilled within me powerful values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| Values like tzedek, which means justice, and tikkun olam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| which is a Jewish concept that implores us to create a world in which everyone has basic human rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| dignity, equality, and freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| Judaism also teaches that the death of one person is the loss of an entire world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| And these Jewish values and my love for the Jewish people are why I'm standing before you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| asking you as a city council to pass this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| Over the past seven weeks, we have witnessed unspeakable losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| Nearly 1,200 Israelis and 15,000 Palestinians have been killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| And I grieve each of these lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| Entire worlds lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| Ma'am, if you could just pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| It's too many people at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| One person at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| Can we please stop the clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Members of the audience, one person at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| The person who came up and stood behind her, please sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Please sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| One person at the podium so she can speak in peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| I'm going to start the clock again in a few minutes, in a few seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| Okay, you're going to lose your opportunity to speak unless you're quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| Everybody, let this woman speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| And when we hear the people opposed to this, we're going to let them speak in peace as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| Okay, please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| What we have witnessed also is the collective punishment of the Palestinian people of Gaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| which is a war crime under international law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| The mass bombing of hospitals, schools, and refugee camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| and the shutting off of all access to electricity, water, food, and humanitarian aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| Entire generations of families killed, wiped from the registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| This is genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| There is no other way to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| But what we've witnessed over these past seven weeks is not an exception or a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| The root cause of this violence is the occupation of Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| For 75 years, Israel has maintained an apartheid system of discrimination, dispossession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| and overwhelming violence against Palestinians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| For 16 years, the Israeli government has suffocated Gaza under a military blockade, and it has to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| They did not teach me when I was growing up as a young Jewish girl in Knoxville about the Nakba,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| about the violent expulsion of more than three-quarter of a million Palestinians from their homes and lands in 1948| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| in order to establish a Jewish state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| At synagogue, they told me it was a land without a people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| because many of them had been taught the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| They did not tell me that before the founding of Israel, Jews, Muslims, and Christians had lived beside one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| as neighbors in Palestine for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| They told me what they'd been told, that a Jewish nation-state was the only solution to Jewish safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| So to my local Jewish community here tonight, speaking in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| I want you to know I hear your grief, and I share it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| I also hear your fear that is rooted in generations of trauma, oppression, and anti-Semitism that is all real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6739)|
| 1:52:26| I know because this fear lives in my body, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| But Jewish safety will never, never be found through a militarized nation-state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6749)|
| 1:52:37| The only path to peace and safety for everyone is through ensuring justice and equality for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6757)|
| 1:52:44| Because Jewish liberation and Palestinian liberation is intertwined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| I come from a Judaism that for millennia has opposed empire, colonization, and nationalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6770)|
| 1:52:57| a tradition that values every human life and is rooted in social justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| I am the descendant of people who have survived genocide, like many of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| displacement, ethnic cleansing, and persecution because of who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| Never again means never again for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6791)|
| 1:53:19| Never again includes Palestinians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| Never again is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| It is not anti-Semitic to condemn this violence and the Israeli government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| just like it is not un-American to criticize and question our American government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| Zionism is not Judaism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6820)|
| 1:53:48| I encourage my Jewish community to listen tonight, to listen to your Palestinian neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| many of whom you've probably never met before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| I encourage you to listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| I stand before you, all of you as city council, alongside my Palestinian neighbors and beloved community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| along with many other Jews, many other Jews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| and allies calling for a ceasefire and an end to the occupation, calling for a free Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| As a city council, I ask you to please pass this resolution and to join us in building a Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| and a world where everyone is free and able to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| Okay, now we have three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| Members of the audience, please quiet down so we can hear the next speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now! Ceasefire now!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| Thank you. Thank you to the audience members who have allowed the speakers to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| Now we will hear three speakers who are opposed to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| If you could please clear the aisles so the speakers can get to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| And again, I appreciate everyone's respect for the speaker's right to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| and also for council members' need to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| If the first speaker, who is speaking in opposition, could make his way to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6914)|
| 1:55:20| please make room for the people to get to and from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| First speaker, if you could state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Brian Goldberg, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| I stand before this council as the president of the Knoxville Jewish Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| To help provide perspective of whom I speak for and to clarify what our alliance is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| we run both the Arnstein Jewish Community Center in Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| and the Knoxville Affiliate Office of the Jewish Federations of North America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| We all know what a community center is, and many of you may be familiar with ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| Out of it, we run both a preschool and a summer day camp with our beautiful pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| But we are so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| We run the following agencies from under our own umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| BJ Library, BBYO and BBYO Connect, Hillel at UTK, Jewish Family Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| the Jewish Archives of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| In addition to the affirmation agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| every single major Jewish organization has a seat on our board with fiduciary responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| Those include Temple Beth-El, Heska Amunah Synagogue, Chabad of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| the Knoxville Jewish Day School, Hadassah of Knoxville and Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| the Knoxville Jewish Endowment Fund, the Jewish Community of Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| and the Greater Knoxville Jewish Men's Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| Personally, I am also a member of the Federation's National Youth Leadership Cabinet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| I am a member of the Federation's Advocacy Corps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| and I sit on the overall board of trustees for the Jewish Federations of North America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=6996)|
| 1:56:40| I think it is safe to say I am qualified to speak for the Jewish community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| As that spokesperson, I am shocked at the lack of outreach to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| by both the author of this resolution and of its supporters and its crafting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| Both claim to have Jewish supporters and to be working with Jewish groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| Now there are those amongst us tonight who may pretend to speak for the Jewish community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| and support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| If they represent the Jewish voice for peace, they are not members of the Jewish community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| This organization is a con made to disguise itself as an altruistic entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7028)|
| 1:57:17| while exposing some of the most anti-Semitic rubbish I have ever heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| Amongst the litany of hurtful actions that the organization has taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| against the interests of the American Jewish communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| they have attempted to co-op and demonize the word Zionist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| I believe they do this so they and others feel more socially accepted by bashing Zionists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| instead of outright bashing Jews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| Zionism is the movement for self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| and their ancestral homeland, the Land of Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| Zion, the biblical term for both the Land of Israel and Jerusalem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| has been a cornerstone of Jewish communal life for 2,000 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| As a leader, I recognize the truth that some people in attendance tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| do not believe in the validity of the State of Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| and will not stop in their attempts to create a revisionist history narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| which justifies their hatred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| However, as a son and a grandson of avowed Zionists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| and myself a proud Zionist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| I say to you enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| Full stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| Let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| Members of the audience, please let the speaker speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| Let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| I have received absolutely nothing but unabashed outrage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| and deep sadness over the mere prospect of this resolution from my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7112)|
| 1:58:37| My community is hurt by this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| The sheer volume of communication we have received has been both overwhelming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| from the Jewish community and from those outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| I should be helping plan our community Hanukkah celebrations that start in nine days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| not speaking to you all about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| The assumptions in this resolution's wording are base conjecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| not supported by fact, and this alone should be reason enough to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| that this resolution not move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| Even more importantly, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| which has neither the mandate to wade into geopolitics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| or the experience to opine on foreign affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| should not waste its citizens' time and resources as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| But alas, the detractors of the only democratic country in the Middle East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| exercising its right to self-defense against a terrorist organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| will stop at no lengths to gain traction for their revisionist goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| Their recent efforts have failed spectacularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| with great bipartisan support against them at the national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| They have failed at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| and so now they turn their efforts towards local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| By the way, earlier it was mentioned the United Nations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| In 2020...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| Members of the audience, please let the speaker speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| In 2020, there were only 60% of the United Nations in 2020 were not democracies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| This year, over 70% of the UN Rights Council members are not democracies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| And by the way, Iran is the president of the Council of Human Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| While I hope we end this resolution's charade shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| there is one lasting effect these proceedings will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| Completely avoidable acrimony and hurt within the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| to two distinct communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| Both communities are hurting deeply and both have suffered immeasurable losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| and we should not diminish those truths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| But to the supporters of this resolution and to its author,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| I stand here representing the entire Jewish community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| against your effort to create a revisionist history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| that breeds divisiveness and hate within this great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| Let me conclude by emulating what the great state of Israel...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| I'm grant... Mr. Goldberg, please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| You've been interrupted several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| Let me conclude by emulating what the great state of Israel has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| time and time again to its warring neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Please let the speaker speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| By offering to sit down in good faith with anyone to repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| what others have tried so hard to tear apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| Mr. Goldberg, just wait until we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| Mr. Goldberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7264)|
| 2:01:15| Okay, let's get them very nervous going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| I called it every time that we hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| Speakers and members of the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| every time council members cannot hear the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| we're going to pause the clock and give the speakers more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| So, Mr. Goldberg, I apologize for the interruptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| We'll take the next speaker in opposition of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| And, again, I've asked Mr. Johnson, the timekeeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| to pause the clock every time we cannot hear the speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| So every time you interrupt the speaker, they're going to get more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| Mr. Johnson, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| You may start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| State your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| and you'll have up to five minutes and we will pause it if we can't hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| My name is Mark Siegel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| I live at 3827 Glenfield Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7321)|
| 2:02:07| I'd like to ask those people who have come here tonight in opposition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| the resolution to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| We didn't prepare any cheers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| We're not standing in the aisles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| But I do want you to note that we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| I don't have a five-minute summary of the Middle East situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7343)|
| 2:02:34| We can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| I speak softly and carry a big sheet of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| What I do have is a three-word summary about the Middle East situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| It's extremely complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| It's also not what the city of Knoxville is here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7367)|
| 2:02:54| As we've already seen amply tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| weighing into the Middle East situation will not bring Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| It will separate us and create conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| I'm Jewish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| I was born in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| I'm currently chairman of Hezkemenah Synagogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| For my entire adult life I have prayed for two states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace in the Middle East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| I stand with Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| but the devastation that we're seeing in the Middle East right now pains me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| and my soul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| It's also horrifying but entirely predictable that this war has caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| concurrent outbreaks of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism here in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| From my perspective, the reason that this is happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| the root cause is the refusal of Palestinians to accept the state of Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| and to live side by side in peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| When you hear the chant, from the river to the sea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| this means Israel should be destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| When I was growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| this was accompanied by the promise that the Jews would be driven into the sea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| That part is usually no longer said out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| Some of my congregants have told me that they were scared of what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7455)|
| 2:04:22| at your last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| What scared them is they know that what from the river to the sea means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| Pause the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| Mr. Siegel, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| My congregants know what from the river to the sea means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| and they know Jews have experienced murder and expulsion time after time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| for hundreds and hundreds of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| After the Nazi Holocaust, we swore never again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| So when Hamas inflicts the bloodiest day in Jewish history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| since that Nazi Holocaust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| when grandparents and babies are slaughtered and kidnapped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| when women are raped and marched naked through the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| there's going to be a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| There have been multiple opportunities when the Palestinian people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| could have stepped forward and had a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| Somebody said, this didn't start on October 7th, it started in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7521)|
| 2:05:27| I don't know if it started in the times of the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| I don't know if it started when the Balfour Declaration was declared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| I don't know if it started when the Palestinians rejected the partition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| plan of the United Nations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| In 1947, when the Oslo Accords failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7544)|
| 2:05:51| it's been going on for decades and decades and maybe centuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7551)|
| 2:05:59| But the truth is, until last month, Israel had not occupied Gaza since 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7559)|
| 2:06:07| when Israel unilaterally uprooted all Jewish settlers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7567)|
| 2:06:13| and turned Gaza over to the Palestinian Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| Since that time, billions of dollars have gone into Gaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| but the standard of living there is still deplorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| Yet a massive supply of modern weapons of war has been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| and an infrastructure from which terrorist operations are run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7588)|
| 2:06:39| If you feel compelled to weigh in on the Middle East situation, help Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| People in this area overwhelmingly support Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| As chair of my synagogue, I have heard Jewish people elsewhere saying they feel alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7610)|
| 2:06:58| To the contrary, here, apart from tonight, I feel very supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7618)|
| 2:07:04| On virtually a daily basis, people contact the synagogue to tell me of their support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| and prayers for Israel and the Jewish people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| People here tonight have told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| We'll take the next and final speaker in opposition to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7638)|
| 2:07:25| Rabbi Yossi, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7645)|
| 2:07:43| Good evening. My name is Rabbi Yossi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| I'm the Chabad rabbi serving the Knoxville Jewish community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| I'm a chaplain with the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| and when called to duty, I serve indiscriminately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| On October 7th, the most joyous holiday of Simchat Torah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| a barbaric enemy perpetrated a despicable attack on the Holy Land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| No one was spared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| Women and girls were brutally raped, even the elderly and the frail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| Pause the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7697)|
| 2:08:25| Members of the audience, you need to be quiet and let the speaker speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| Please be quiet and let the speaker speak, just like we heard from the other speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| Even the elderly and frail were tortured and executed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| and over 240 adults and children were taken hostage to the terrorist-controlled Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7724)|

| 2:09:07| On October 7th, on the holiday…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| Stop the clock. Stop the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7751)|
| 2:09:20| Members of the audience, you need to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| Ms. Evry, Ms. Evry, you need to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| Can I just say something outside of my minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| Let's take a deep breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| We are in disagreement, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| the same God that you believe in is the same God that put me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| So let's be respectful of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| Members of the audience, please let the speaker speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| and pay them the respect to let them exercise their First Amendment rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| just like the other speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| And then also let city council be able to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| Rabbi, please continue. Start the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| On October 7th, on the holiday of Simchat Torah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| every synagogue in Israel and throughout the world read the first chapter of Genesis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7810)|
| 2:10:16| the story of creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| Rashi, the 11th century classic commentator of the Bible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| asked why the Torah, which is a book of instructions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| begins with the story of creation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| followed by the chapters about the life of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| the forefathers of the Jewish nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| Instead, the Bible should have started with the story of the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7836)|
| 2:10:43| He explains that a day would come in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| when people will accuse the Jewish nation of stealing the Holy Land from others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7848)|
| 2:10:54| The Bible, therefore, sets down the premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| that God, as the creator and the master of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| He alone chose to gift the Holy Land to the Jewish nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| And all claims to the contrary have no basis in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7866)|
| 2:11:19| In Genesis 12, God promises Abraham, the patriarch of the Jewish nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7879)|
| 2:11:25| that his descendants would receive the Holy Land as an internal inheritance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7885)|
| 2:11:31| This promise is reiterated to Isaac in Genesis 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| and then again to Jacob in Genesis 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| Our right to the Holy Land, to the land of Israel, was given to us by God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7898)|
| 2:11:46| This privilege...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| Our right to the land of Israel was given to us by God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| This privilege comes with an obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| An obligation recognized by international law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| and practiced by every country on the globe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| to defend its people and its borders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| Calling for a ceasefire is a call for Hamas to wipe Israel and the Jewish people off the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7934)|
| 2:12:28| Please, please be quiet. Let the speaker speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| Calling for a ceasefire is a call for Hamas to regroup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| and indiscriminately shoot rockets at civilians in Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| Calling for a ceasefire is a call for Hamas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| to continue to hold the civilian population in Gaza hostage as human shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| Calling for a ceasefire is a call to continue the instability of the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| and allow Hamas to continue to wreak havoc throughout the Middle East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| Anyone supporting this bill is disguising their true mantra,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| from river to sea, the one and only genocidal call in this conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| Perhaps the most important question we must ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| how did we get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| How did we lose our moral compass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| How has the genocidal chant from the river to the sea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| Palestine will be free, become acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| Hate speech is the first stage, violence comes soon after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| We must not forget the promise humanity made never again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8015)|
| 2:13:44| In two short weeks we will be celebrating the holiday of Hanukkah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| Hanukkah celebrates the victory of a small Jewish army of Maccabees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| over the mighty Syrian Greek army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| We celebrate the miraculous victory of good over evil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| light over darkness, the weak over the mighty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| and the submission of the wicked into the hands of the righteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| On October 7th, Hamas drew a line in the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| On one side is evil, hate and destruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| On the other side is humanity, good and righteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| This attack transcends religious and cultural differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| It is a clear fight between the forces of hatred and evil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| and those of good and light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| Thank you. Thank you, Rabbi Yossi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| Members of the audience, it's time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8076)|
| 2:14:52| Members of the audience, please, please be quiet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| so council can't discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8096)|
| 2:15:21| Members of the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| thank you for the three people speaking from each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8123)|
| 2:15:28| Clearly there are some very strong feelings on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| We have upheld our First Amendment duties as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| Now the public has had their chance to speak to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| both pro and con on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| Now it's the public's chance to listen to council discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| I ask that you take your seats and be quiet and listen to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| as they discuss this and consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8156)|

| 2:16:18| You have to speak loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| Mayor, I'd like to propose that we take a brief recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| as emotions are very high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| and let the audience regroup so we can have order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| Is that what the council wishes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| Okay, let's reconvene at 8.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8194)|
| 2:16:41| Oh, nine-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8201)|

| 2:16:48| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8208)|
| 2:16:57| It's 8.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I'm calling this meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8219)|

| 2:18:27| I wanted to return to the statement released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| by the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8310)|
| 2:18:34| where it states that such egregious violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| cannot be justified in the name of self-defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| after attacks by Hamas on October 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| which we have condemned in the strongest possible terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| the experts said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| Israel remains the occupying power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| in the occupied Palestinian territory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8330)|

| 2:18:54| and therefore cannot wage a war against the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| under its belligerent occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| In order to be legitimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| Israel's response must be strictly within the framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8341)|

| 2:22:15| is not only the fate of Israelis and Palestinians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| but a serious conflagration of the conflict in the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| leading to more human rights violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8542)|

| 2:22:39| by the international community to prevent a genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| I wanted to read those words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| from the United Nations Human Rights Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| of the High Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8568)|
| 2:22:51| so that we would have independent experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| who presumably have no tie to this conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8576)|
| 2:23:04| that can give their independent opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| of what we are seeing happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| And according to their expert opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| what we are seeing are signs of genocide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| if we do not take action as an international community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| That is why I brought this resolution forward today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| not only because it concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8605)|
| 2:23:29| to see the words that have been shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8609)|
| 2:23:35| about standing with Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| when we have a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8618)|
| 2:23:44| that UN experts have identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| as potentially leading to genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8627)|
| 2:23:54| In that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| we must lift up our voices as an international community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| and particularly if our voices have been lifted up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8641)|
| 2:24:07| to state that we condone the actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8647)|
| 2:24:13| of the State of Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| then we must come and clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| that we do not condone the violence in Gaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8658)|
| 2:24:24| that we do not support the continued bombardment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| that threatens genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| I am concerned about some of the statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| that I heard today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| that would call on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| to ignore the violence that we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8681)|
| 2:24:45| that is being paid for with our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8685)|
| 2:24:48| That is something that I'm just not able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| and I think that we're called upon to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| And so I brought this resolution forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| in hopes that we can come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| as a Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| to call for a ceasefire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| for both Israel and Hamas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| and to call for a lasting peace in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8713)|
| 2:25:17| That's the purpose of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=8717)|
