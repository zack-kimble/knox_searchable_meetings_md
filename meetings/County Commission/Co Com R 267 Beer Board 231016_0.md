| 0:05:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| This is your second time in six months selling beer to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=334)|

| 0:05:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| This girl was new and she was appointed, I think, just a couple of weeks before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| incident happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Okay, because you know if it goes to a third term, third violation, that gets very, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| I know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Does your employee also know that the driver's license, they don't even have to key in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| date of birth if they just look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| You know, the driver's license that you have looks like this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| But if someone's under the age, it's like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Yeah, it's vertical, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| So they're aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Yeah, they are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| But I think sometimes they really don't care and I take that responsibility because my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=388)|
| 0:06:36| PURE system has the 3D scanner which scans the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| But I mean, I take that responsibility but my cashier don't understand that, how serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| this issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Well, and as you know as the owner of the beer permit, that it's a privilege to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| beer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| It is not a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| So you can lose that privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Yes, sir, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Do we have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Seeing none, I will turn it over to Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=427)|

| 0:07:20| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker, for your line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| You know, Mr. Donani, I do notice that this establishment has had a beer permit for almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| eight years and these are obviously the first two violations but they are very close together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| and I would reiterate what my colleague said about, you understand, the third violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| is a very serious matter to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Under our precedent and our rules, I will move that we impose a 30-day suspension of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| the license or a $1,500 fine at the choice of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| I apologize, a 60-day suspension or a $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Okay, that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| Motion made by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=491)|

| 0:16:45| felt like under our charter that this beer board could present a change in the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| that would satisfy our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| We've adopted a comprehensive ordinance on beer alcohol sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| I tend to take an expansive view of the powers that we have under our charter, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| that we could amend that ordinance to prohibit the kind of transfers that you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| You just have to figure out how to word it so it accomplishes what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| But I do believe we have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| I'd like to request then that if there's no objection or if we need a motion to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| Director Moyers to work on that rewording so that it's an appropriate ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| we could bring for our rule changes for beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| Do we have any discussion before the motion and the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| I think Commissioner Jay, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Have we discussed the time period in which, I mean, I think the goal of this is Bob Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1073)|
| 0:18:03| gets his third violation, and then he basically transferred the business to Linda Smith, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| she takes over and keeps on going, and it obviously is still a place that violates beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| board laws, and we're trying to sort of close that loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| But have we talked about the time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Is that once you've hit your third or fourth or it's been revoked, that establishment loses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| it for a year, six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I mean, is there a time period in which a family member, let's say Bob Smith, screws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| it up and he can't sell beer for a year and decides not to be in the business, maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| year later, you know, a son or daughter decides to pick it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| Have we talked about that timeline yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Well, under the ordinance, if a beer license is revoked, no beer can be sold on the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| That's the punitive period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| I would not think it would be, I mean, my personal feeling would be if after a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1135)|
| 0:19:03| Bob Smith's wife wants to open up a place there, that shouldn't be a problem because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| there's not been anything there for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Bob Smith himself would not be prohibited after a year of trying to get a new license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| That would be allowable under the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| So the big punishment, if you revoke, is that no beer can be sold in that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| That's enough to put most places that rely on beer sales out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| Okay, so what, then help me understand what's the loop we're trying to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| Sometimes we'll see, if I may, a request for when they get to their second or their third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1177)|
| 0:19:48| violation and they know that next time there's going to be a revocation, then they sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1188)|
| 0:19:56| or they transfer ownership to another family member so their number goes back to zero again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1196)|
| 0:20:06| at the same location with essentially the same management and leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| Okay, and so you, Director Moyers, you think there's a way to, I'm trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| how do we word that in a way that doesn't, you're putting a scarlet letter on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| regardless of who owns it essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| There's some language in the state statutes, and they may be in our ordinance, I need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| take a look, that does address this, not directly, but it talks about failing to transfer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| transfers to family members who could take under the laws of intestacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| That's how the state has decided to make this definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| You could still probably sell to your third cousin twice removed, but not your son, your wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| your father, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| So that may be something that we need to add to our line of questioning if we do get a sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| or a transfer of license or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| I think the way I would conceive of it is that no beer license could be transferred to a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| member, however defined, while there is a pending violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| I think that would take care of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Or you could say while there's one pending or after three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| This board, I think on three violations, still usually, unless it's particularly egregious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| offers the finer suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Revocations, I haven't seen generally unless there's four or more, in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| So we can word it to say, you know, after three, you can't transfer to a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| If there's a violation pending, you can't transfer to a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| We can work on those things and try to come up with something that's not overly punitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| but does accomplish what the board is trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| I think, if I remember correctly, Vice Chair Hill, you're thinking of something that happened about two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1324)|
| 0:22:14| where the father had his third beer sales, and then we gave him a 90-day, he couldn't sell anything for 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1334)|
| 0:22:30| and then he tried to transfer the business 30 days later during the 90-day period to his daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| And the sheriff's office caught that and told us what was going on, and so we didn't allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| But we probably do need to have that in writing so somebody who's under a 90-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| can't just turn it over to a family member or somebody else and then, hey, I'm a new business now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| while it's still going through the process of ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| And I would actually like to catch it even before the suspension, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| And I have ‑‑ I think we've all kind of felt a time or two where that was probably going to be in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1387)|
| 0:23:17| So I just ‑‑ if there's just some way that we can just stop this, we just, yeah, need to close this loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1397)|
| 0:23:27| Is there any other discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1409)|
| 0:23:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| When you said, Mr. Wall Director, when you said family member, would that also include ex‑spouses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| Because I think we had a situation a few months ago with an ex‑spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| Not under the definition that's used by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| Gosh, that would be a wild situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Can we put that language in there that it would, you know, in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| I believe there was an ex‑spouse that was in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| I mean, we can work on the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| As I stated, the state says persons who could take under ‑‑ in an estate under the rules of intestacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1452)|
| 0:24:21| Those rules don't include ex‑spouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| But we could add that to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Can we add that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| So, I hear before Commissioner Lee or Hill gives your motion, Director Moyers will be doing some research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1472)|
| 0:24:42| and putting together this, and obviously it will come back in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Yeah, well, there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| I have to wait for this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Yeah, it would need to be an amendment to our Bureau ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| So, it would have to go before the full county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| So, if you pass this and then Commissioner Hill wants to make it, put it on for November as a first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| we'll have something drafted up for you by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Commissioner Hill, it's in your court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| I believe I understood that we needed a motion to have you go ahead and draft this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| to bring back to us for consideration and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| There's a motion on the floor by Commissioner Hill, a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| If there's no more business to come in front of Knox County Beer Board, I'd like to have a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| Motion by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| And we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016?start=1554)|
