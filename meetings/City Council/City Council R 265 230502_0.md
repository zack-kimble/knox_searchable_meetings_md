| 0:02:37| successful Youth Violence Prevention Week last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=157.5)|
| 0:02:40| There were countless organizations, nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=160.5)|
| 0:02:43| and many volunteers who helped make that week a big success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=163.5)|
| 0:02:47| I want to give a special kudos to LaKenya Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=167.5)|
| 0:02:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=171.5)|
| 0:02:52| Mustafa Ali Smith and Emily Norris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=172.5)|
| 0:02:55| part of the Office of Community Safety and Empowerment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=175.5)|
| 0:02:57| who helped coordinate a lot of those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=177.5)|
| 0:03:00| There were more than two dozen planned events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=180.5)|
| 0:03:03| including a huge turnout for Saturday's kickball tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=183.5)|
| 0:03:06| which was held at the UT practice field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=186.5)|
| 0:03:08| So we had beautiful weather and a great turnout and a lot of kids who felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=188.5)|
| 0:03:14| supported, and I was really, really happy to have such a good event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=194.5)|
| 0:03:19| So thank you to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=199.5)|
| 0:03:21| Tomorrow I want to remind council members that we are cutting the ribbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=201.5)|
| 0:03:25| on Caswell Manor tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=205.5)|
| 0:03:29| We, as you know, contributed $1.4 million to support Caswell Manor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=209.5)|
| 0:03:33| which is a volunteer ministry center's second permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=213.5)|
| 0:03:37| community, and as we all well know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=217.5)|
| 0:03:41| that permanent supportive housing is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=221.5)|
| 0:03:43| It provides safety, stability, support services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=223.5)|
| 0:03:47| and workforce reentry training for people who are working to get back on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=227.5)|
| 0:03:50| their feet after experiencing chronic homelessness sometimes for many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=230.5)|
| 0:03:53| many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=233.5)|
| 0:03:54| Many residents have already moved in earlier this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=234.5)|
| 0:03:57| but it's not until tomorrow that we've been able to celebrate the ribbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=237.5)|
| 0:04:01| cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=241.5)|
| 0:04:02| So it's going to be tomorrow, 11 a.m., at 1501 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=242.5)|
| 0:04:06| You're all invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=246.5)|
| 0:04:12| Also tomorrow we're kicking off the 20th season of the Farmer's Market on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=252.5)|
| 0:04:17| Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=257.5)|
| 0:04:18| I can't believe it's been 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=258.5)|
| 0:04:20| I remember when it first got started, it was sort of a fledgling thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=260.5)|
| 0:04:24| Sometimes the markets had a lot of things to buy and sometimes not so many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=264.5)|
| 0:04:29| but it's certainly thriving now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=269.5)|
| 0:04:32| and I know that we are regular customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=272.5)|
| 0:04:35| as I'm sure thousands of Knoxville residents are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=275.5)|
| 0:04:38| So come out and enjoy all the local vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=278.5)|
| 0:04:41| And a big thanks to a small group of volunteers who had a vision for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=281.5)|
| 0:04:45| market 20 years ago and to nourish Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=285.5)|
| 0:04:48| who helped grow the market into what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=288.5)|
| 0:04:51| This is a huge asset to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=291.5)|
| 0:04:53| It's been fun to watch it evolve over the last two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=293.5)|
| 0:04:56| So that's tomorrow at 10 a.m., and then a short distance away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=296.5)|
| 0:05:01| 11 a.m., is the Caswell Manor ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=301.5)|
| 0:05:05| Finally, a quick reminder about the rules of decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=305.5)|
| 0:05:08| Those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item or during public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=308.5)|
| 0:05:12| forum should sign up with our city recorder, Mr. Johnson, ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=312.5)|
| 0:05:16| Please do not use profanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=316.5)|
| 0:05:18| And when speaking to specific agenda items, please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=318.5)|
| 0:05:22| Those who fail to adhere to those rules may be ruled out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=322.5)|
| 0:05:25| and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=325.5)|
| 0:05:27| For those who are listening, please note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=327.5)|
| 0:05:29| you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=329.5)|
| 0:05:31| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=331.5)|
| 0:05:33| Appreciate it in advance, everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=333.5)|
| 0:05:36| And that concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=336.5)|
| 0:05:38| Are there any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=338.5)|

| 0:05:56| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=356.5)|
| 0:05:57| Yes, we just had a very successful Rossini Festival in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=357.5)|
| 0:06:01| and there was one person that was missing, that was Brandon Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=361.5)|
| 0:06:05| He was a very talented opera singer and a true talent in this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=365.5)|
| 0:06:10| and I just wanted to note his passing of natural causes earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=370.5)|
| 0:06:17| Also, he was a writer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=377.5)|
| 0:06:18| and some of his work is being published in the weekly blank of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=378.5)|
| 0:06:23| newspaper on the stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=383.5)|

| 0:06:28| But we will miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=388.5)|
| 0:06:29| He was a real pillar in the opera and in the art community in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=389.5)|

| 0:06:39| The KTA board met last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=399.5)|
| 0:06:41| I want to give my colleagues an update on CAT Reimagined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=401.5)|
| 0:06:45| As a refresher, the board voted last year to increase frequency in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=405.5)|
| 0:06:48| network and published a draft with the help of a consultant to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=408.5)|
| 0:06:53| frequency in a 45-minute network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=413.5)|
| 0:06:57| In the resulting draft, some stats are 16% more access to jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=417.5)|
| 0:07:03| 20% more access to jobs for those of low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=423.5)|
| 0:07:06| 22% access to jobs for those without a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=426.5)|
| 0:07:10| Residents of color have access to 24% more jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=430.5)|
| 0:07:14| 23% more jobs within 15 minutes of a ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=434.5)|
| 0:07:17| and Sunday service that would match current Saturday service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=437.5)|
| 0:07:21| So a lot of improvements in the draft network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=441.5)|
| 0:07:23| Still, there were multiple public meetings where some issues are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=443.5)|
| 0:07:28| unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=448.5)|
| 0:07:29| So we're working to resolve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=449.5)|
| 0:07:31| The staff is looking at three or four priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=451.5)|
| 0:07:35| One is access at Broadway Towers, Route 23 reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=455.5)|
| 0:07:41| service to the O'Connor Senior Center, Route 90 reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=461.5)|
| 0:07:47| and paratransit and microtransit opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=467.5)|
| 0:07:50| So CAT staff has gone back to the consultant for draft version two to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=470.5)|
| 0:07:57| address these gaps specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=477.5)|
| 0:07:59| and will bring that second version of a draft network either to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=479.5)|
| 0:08:04| May or June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=484.5)|
| 0:08:05| So I just wanted to give you all an update on where we started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=485.5)|
| 0:08:08| where we are, and where we still have room to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=488.5)|
| 0:08:12| So look for an announcement for the May or June meeting for an updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=492.5)|
| 0:08:17| draft, and we'll do another round of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=497.5)|
| 0:08:20| much like we have throughout the whole CAT reimagined process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=500.5)|
| 0:08:23| The board has all agreed on one thing particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=503.5)|
| 0:08:26| and that is that we will take as long as we need to to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=506.5)|
| 0:08:30| So May or June will be the new draft meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=510.5)|
| 0:08:33| or the new draft network for CAT reimagined for the public to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=513.5)|
| 0:08:37| So you're welcome to join.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=517.5)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=520.5)|

| 0:13:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=810.5)|
| 0:13:52| Okay, next on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=832.5)|
| 0:13:55| The next item on the agenda is a resolution authorizing the Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=835.5)|
| 0:13:57| Development Board of the City of Knoxville to negotiate and accept from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=837.5)|

| 0:14:28| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=868.5)|
| 0:14:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=870.5)|
| 0:14:31| A question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=871.5)|
| 0:14:32| Is there a, I did not see it in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=872.5)|
| 0:14:34| but a but-for analysis for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=874.5)|
| 0:14:36| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=876.5)|
| 0:14:37| There, Rebecca Jane Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=877.5)|
| 0:14:39| I thought I, there's, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=879.5)|
| 0:14:41| If you could come up and respond to this question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=881.5)|
| 0:14:47| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=887.5)|
| 0:14:48| Yes, there, there is, there should have been a but-for analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=888.5)|
| 0:14:51| The Municap report in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=891.5)|
| 0:14:53| If there wasn't, we can certainly send that to you afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=893.5)|
| 0:14:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=897.5)|
| 0:14:58| If you had a specific question, I have it here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=898.5)|
| 0:15:01| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=901.5)|
| 0:15:05| The, I mean, if you can point it out what page it's on, that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=905.5)|
| 0:15:13| Page 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=913.5)|
| 0:15:15| Is that what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=915.5)|
| 0:15:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=916.5)|
| 0:15:18| Page 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=918.5)|
| 0:15:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=919.5)|
| 0:15:23| Ms. Justice, perhaps you could just give us the takeaways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=923.5)|
| 0:15:26| They did the analysis and they said but-for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=926.5)|
| 0:15:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=929.5)|
| 0:15:30| So, this project is a really unique infill opportunity for a vacant site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=930.5)|
| 0:15:34| in our downtown on West 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=934.5)|
| 0:15:37| It is 144 total residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=937.5)|
| 0:15:40| That include workforce, live-work, and market-rate housing opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=940.5)|
| 0:15:45| as well as retail and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=945.5)|
| 0:15:48| This is a 10-year pilot with a three-year construction period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=948.5)|
| 0:15:52| and the estimated annual rate of return with the pilot is 9.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=952.5)|
| 0:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=960.5)|
| 0:16:01| So, on page 62, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=961.5)|
| 0:16:06| Municap's scope of work does not include an analysis of qualitative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=966.5)|
| 0:16:09| considerations as to whether the project would proceed without public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=969.5)|
| 0:16:12| assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=972.5)|
| 0:16:14| Municap believes that qualitative factors should be contemplated in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=974.5)|
| 0:16:18| full but-for analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=978.5)|
| 0:16:20| I was wondering if there's a full but-for analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=980.5)|
| 0:16:25| KCDC, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=985.5)|
| 0:16:30| Yeah, so, in this limited analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=990.5)|
| 0:16:32| I think the way I would think about it is the city has a pretty robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=992.5)|
| 0:16:36| process on the front end that's more qualitative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=996.5)|
| 0:16:38| so it really speaks to some of the development priorities that are listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=998.5)|
| 0:16:42| on the front page, and it's sort of an up-down of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1002.5)|
| 0:16:45| do we as a city support this type of effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1005.5)|
| 0:16:48| And if we were hiring an external party to come in and tell us as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1008.5)|
| 0:16:53| inform us what, from a qualitative perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1013.5)|
| 0:16:55| would be a good way to go, then we might undertake that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1015.5)|
| 0:16:59| But the process that we've created is, locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1019.5)|
| 0:17:03| what are the development priorities for a project like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1023.5)|
| 0:17:06| And then Municap comes as more of a financial review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1026.5)|
| 0:17:10| So, in this case, they're looking specifically at, with a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1030.5)|
| 0:17:16| the return is 9.1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1036.5)|
| 0:17:18| Without a pilot, the return is 7.4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1038.5)|
| 0:17:24| So, just to summarize what you've stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1044.5)|
| 0:17:31| we do an informal analysis internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1051.5)|
| 0:17:34| Are we looking at whether this project would move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1054.5)|
| 0:17:39| but for the public assistance being provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1059.5)|
| 0:17:41| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1061.5)|
| 0:17:42| I think the qualitative factors, and it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1062.5)|
| 0:17:45| it's unusual wording, but they're getting at the things that can't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1065.5)|
| 0:17:50| that's an I hate it when I make an obvious statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1070.5)|
| 0:17:52| the things that can't be quantified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1072.5)|
| 0:17:54| And so, yes, we do part one internally as more of those qualitative factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1074.5)|
| 0:18:00| analysis, then we move on, and Municap helps us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1080.5)|
| 0:18:04| with the true financial but-for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1084.5)|
| 0:18:07| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1087.5)|
| 0:18:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1088.5)|
| 0:18:09| Do you all put that analysis in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1089.5)|
| 0:18:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1091.5)|
| 0:18:12| So, that analysis is, as the mayor stated, it starts on page, did you say 54?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1092.5)|
| 0:18:18| So, it is, oh, you mean the qualitative piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1098.5)|
| 0:18:20| She means the qualitative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1100.5)|
| 0:18:21| So, the qualitative piece, if you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1101.5)|
| 0:18:24| and there are actually some of the bulleted points from that are mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1104.5)|
| 0:18:29| in the background, just the very beginning page of this item, page 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1109.5)|
| 0:18:34| So, you can see the expansion of permanent housing supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1114.5)|
| 0:18:38| the workforce housing unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1118.5)|
| 0:18:39| So, there's 14 workforce housing units within this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1119.5)|
| 0:18:43| There's a few other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1123.5)|
| 0:18:44| Obviously, that was a very underutilized piece of property near a transit line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1124.5)|
| 0:18:49| So, there's a lot of those qualitative factors that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1129.5)|
| 0:18:56| I guess part of my concern with the analysis, and not necessarily this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1136.5)|
| 0:19:01| but I believe this has come up in discussion before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1141.5)|
| 0:19:07| outside of the quantitative analysis that says the developer needs to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1147.5)|
| 0:19:12| you know, 10% return rather than 7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1152.5)|
| 0:19:16| is just whether these projects would actually move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1156.5)|
| 0:19:24| It might look a little bit differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1164.5)|
| 0:19:29| but, you know, would we still see the redevelopment of this underutilized parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1169.5)|
| 0:19:39| under this current market is what I'm questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1179.5)|
| 0:19:44| Ms. Parker, there's some other people with lights on, so I'll go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1184.5)|
| 0:19:48| If you have an answer to that question, then I'll go on to the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1188.5)|
| 0:19:51| I'll take a stab, and I'll lead with a terrible straddling of the fence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1191.5)|
| 0:19:56| We don't know, but we're very confident the 14 workforce housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1196.5)|
| 0:20:01| would not be included otherwise, so we're certain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1201.5)|
| 0:20:06| In terms of the return, the return that they are 7.4%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1206.5)|
| 0:20:12| is probably not going to get the project done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1212.5)|
| 0:20:15| but we don't know their capital needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1215.5)|
| 0:20:17| Each project is a little different, so it might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1217.5)|
| 0:20:22| Council Member Ryder and then Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1222.5)|
| 0:20:26| Okay, I have a question, and then I want to throw back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1226.5)|
| 0:20:29| and re-summarize what you just said, Mr. Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1229.5)|
| 0:20:32| So the project might move forward without the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1232.5)|
| 0:20:35| but it might not include workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1235.5)|
| 0:20:38| That's correct, and I would say it definitely would not include the workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1238.5)|
| 0:20:42| So that's the part that we negotiated, and that is what are the total number of units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1242.5)|
| 0:20:47| The total number of units is 124.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1247.5)|
| 0:20:50| Okay, the other thing that â€“ I have a parking question specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1250.5)|
| 0:20:54| The other thing that's interesting in this is I see in here in the sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1254.5)|
| 0:20:58| average monthly rent per live-work unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1258.5)|
| 0:21:01| Tell me what a live-work unit is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1261.5)|
| 0:21:03| because I don't think we've seen one specifically with that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1263.5)|
| 0:21:06| Right, so this is also part of what we are able to negotiate into this deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1266.5)|
| 0:21:10| is by proposal of the developer, these types of live-work units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1270.5)|
| 0:21:14| where there may be a small office space included in the residential space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1274.5)|
| 0:21:20| that has a storefront or a maker space or a jewelry shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1280.5)|
| 0:21:25| or somewhere where they can have meetings or sell their goods by right of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1285.5)|
| 0:21:31| That's also incorporated into their residential space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1291.5)|
| 0:21:34| So that would be like the ground floor units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1294.5)|
| 0:21:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1297.5)|
| 0:21:38| Okay, that is fascinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1298.5)|
| 0:21:40| I have a question about parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1300.5)|
| 0:21:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1302.5)|
| 0:21:43| Someone asked me if bike lanes were being requested to be removed to accommodate parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1303.5)|
| 0:21:49| and I hope the answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1309.5)|
| 0:21:51| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1311.5)|
| 0:21:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1313.5)|
| 0:21:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1314.5)|
| 0:21:55| We are working with engineering and the developer to adjust the right-of-way cross-section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1315.5)|
| 0:22:02| to still have bike lanes, parallel parking, and two lanes of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1322.5)|
| 0:22:06| Okay, and I just want to state out loud why that should be a hard no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1326.5)|
| 0:22:10| I'm happy to hope that that was never a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1330.5)|
| 0:22:15| We've had other businesses in the community that have asked for bike lanes to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1335.5)|
| 0:22:20| so that they could have the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1340.5)|
| 0:22:23| and the answer to them was no, no matter how much they begged and pleaded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1343.5)|
| 0:22:27| because people were using those bike lanes, and that's a commitment that we have as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1347.5)|
| 0:22:31| So I don't want to start on that slippery slope to gain housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1351.5)|
| 0:22:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1357.5)|
| 0:22:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1359.5)|
| 0:22:40| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1360.5)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1361.5)|
| 0:22:42| I just want to thank Mr. Bentley, Ms. Justice, and Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1362.5)|
| 0:22:45| Whoever made sure these four bullets are in here, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1365.5)|
| 0:22:48| because I think it helps round out the conversation for why we would accept this pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1368.5)|
| 0:22:53| I think there is it fair to say in the past there was a qualitative narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1373.5)|
| 0:22:57| that we didn't have specific 13 redevelopment priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1377.5)|
| 0:23:01| so Municap would have taken a look and given their best argument or four against why we need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1381.5)|
| 0:23:09| And over the past few months, I guess more than a year, we've established 13 priorities for redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1389.5)|
| 0:23:16| and now that qualitative work is done by us on the front end and stated as such in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1396.5)|
| 0:23:22| Am I following all the right dots, connect all the dots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1402.5)|
| 0:23:24| You're following, yes, and that is correct, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1404.5)|
| 0:23:27| We have a process that is new to the city where we have a multi-step application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1407.5)|
| 0:23:33| where we begin those initial conversations with the developer to guide the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1413.5)|
| 0:23:39| to fulfill as many of those key development priorities as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1419.5)|
| 0:23:43| It would also be directionally correct to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1423.5)|
| 0:23:47| 10 years ago pilots may have been butt forward for the deal to work period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1427.5)|
| 0:23:54| Now it seems like it's not only that, it's also meaning butt forward this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1434.5)|
| 0:23:59| we wouldn't get workforce housing, butt forward this, we wouldn't get public parking garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1439.5)|
| 0:24:04| not instead of bike lanes, but public parking in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1444.5)|
| 0:24:08| Is that a fair assessment of the evolution of pilots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1448.5)|
| 0:24:11| There are a lot of other facets and parameters that we're able to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1451.5)|
| 0:24:15| in the negotiation of coming to a deal in a project, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1455.5)|
| 0:24:20| But generally speaking, it's now for pilots, it's not just that the deal is possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1460.5)|
| 0:24:24| it's also we're asking for you to contribute in certain other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1464.5)|
| 0:24:28| that align with whatever the need is for that particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1468.5)|
| 0:24:31| For sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1471.5)|
| 0:24:32| The way we frame that, Councilman Smith, is it's butt forward plus these other public benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1472.5)|
| 0:24:38| It's the butt forward, the deal, plus what are the other public benefits and those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1478.5)|
| 0:24:43| Yeah, more eloquently, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1483.5)|
| 0:24:46| Thank you, Councilmember Smith, for articulating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1486.5)|
| 0:24:49| And just for people who may not be aware, who might be watching in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1489.5)|
| 0:24:53| you can see these clearly articulated public benefits by just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1493.5)|
| 0:24:59| City of Knoxville Public-Private Partnership Opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1499.5)|
| 0:25:02| Google that, it all comes up, and it's our way of letting potential developers know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1502.5)|
| 0:25:07| what are we looking for if you are applying to get a tax incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1507.5)|
| 0:25:11| It's not just helping you to develop a project and that's it, just to make your returns better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1511.5)|
| 0:25:18| It's to meet these public benefits, and those are clearly stated in a way they hadn't been before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1518.5)|
| 0:25:24| So thank you to Ms. Justice and your team for getting that on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1524.5)|
| 0:25:29| I think it's really well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1529.5)|
| 0:25:31| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1531.5)|
| 0:25:33| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1533.5)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you all for the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1536.5)|
| 0:25:40| The reason I wanted to raise it, and it kind of feels like it's been echoed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1540.5)|
| 0:25:46| is that the public benefit I see here is the workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1546.5)|
| 0:25:52| But the other items I worry if really this were strictly how we were applying or making the analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1552.5)|
| 0:26:03| a lot of developments would fit into this category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1563.5)|
| 0:26:06| Just essentially anyone who commits to a development, if it's a mixed-use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1566.5)|
| 0:26:14| if it's located in a walkable area, it sounds like they're going to get a tax incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1574.5)|
| 0:26:19| whether it's really needed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1579.5)|
| 0:26:22| And so I will just keep emphasizing that we have to see workforce housing included as a part of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1582.5)|
| 0:26:30| And I wanted to ask also about parking and the rationale for the 40 spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1590.5)|
| 0:26:36| especially hearing more detail about the live-work spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1596.5)|
| 0:26:41| and that there is anticipation that those spaces will entertain folks from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1601.5)|
| 0:26:49| There are 40 per zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1609.5)|
| 0:26:52| Parking is not required for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1612.5)|
| 0:26:55| So we do see it as a positive that there are 40 spaces included on the private parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1615.5)|
| 0:27:03| But it's also, as Councilwoman Ryder pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1623.5)|
| 0:27:06| important for us to integrate this development into the streetscape with transportation corridors, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1626.5)|
| 0:27:12| bike lanes, and parallel parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1632.5)|
| 0:27:14| But we have an agreement with TDOT under the bridge where we have public parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1634.5)|
| 0:27:19| and we're looking into extending the ingress and egress of that parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1639.5)|
| 0:27:24| so shared parking can be utilized for the whole area to support not only the local businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1644.5)|
| 0:27:30| but the businesses in this development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1650.5)|
| 0:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1653.5)|
| 0:27:37| Council, I just wanted to add that as someone who's lived and walked and biked in this immediate vicinity for over 20 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1657.5)|
| 0:27:45| and it's been not a heavily utilized space, not a very active space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1665.5)|
| 0:27:51| I'm really excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1671.5)|
| 0:27:54| It's a redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1674.5)|
| 0:27:56| It's going to activate a part of the neighborhood that, you know, hasn't seen much activation in over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1676.5)|
| 0:28:04| So I'm really pleased and hope you'll move forward with a positive vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1684.5)|
| 0:28:09| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=1689.5)|

| 0:36:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2166.46)|
| 0:36:07| My name is Moira Connelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2167.46)|

| 0:36:21| been advocating for almost three years for an alternative response team in the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2181.46)|
| 0:36:26| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2186.46)|
| 0:36:27| As you may recall, an alternative response team pairs a nurse or medic with a behavioral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2187.46)|
| 0:36:32| health professional to respond to mental health and non-violent incidents in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2192.46)|
| 0:36:37| Knoxville deserves a commitment to creating an alternative response team, but that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2197.46)|
| 0:36:42| is not currently reflected in the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2202.46)|
| 0:36:45| We think it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2205.46)|
| 0:36:47| Alternative response teams are used across the country, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2207.46)|
| 0:36:52| Eugene, Oregon, Chicago, Denver, and most recently, San Rafael, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2212.46)|
| 0:36:58| In fact, many mental health professionals consider an alternative response team as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2218.46)|
| 0:37:03| best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2223.46)|
| 0:37:05| Interestingly, other local professionals also consider alternative response teams to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2225.46)|
| 0:37:10| a best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2230.46)|
| 0:37:12| Recently, the University of Tennessee Law School held a public panel discussion on alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2232.46)|
| 0:37:19| to policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2239.46)|
| 0:37:21| Our panelists included Chief Noel, Ms. Middlebrook, a UT professor on sociology, and our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2241.46)|
| 0:37:28| member, Ms. Infame, who works with Community Defense of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2248.46)|
| 0:37:32| When all those panelists were asked about the number one thing that could be done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2252.46)|
| 0:37:39| improve public safety, an alternative response team was affirmed by all four members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2259.46)|
| 0:37:46| panel as essentially the number one thing outside of the police force that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2266.46)|
| 0:37:52| done to improve public safety in any community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2272.46)|
| 0:37:56| And those four panelists had a very divergent point of view on many other questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2276.46)|
| 0:38:01| were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2281.46)|
| 0:38:02| But when they were asked about the single thing that they would recommend to any community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2282.46)|
| 0:38:07| the consensus among all four of them was an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2287.46)|
| 0:38:12| In May of 2021, almost exactly two years ago, I spoke to city council on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2292.46)|
| 0:38:19| As I say, we've been working on this for almost three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2299.46)|
| 0:38:23| At that time, I asked this question, will it take a tragedy before we realize that Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2303.46)|
| 0:38:31| needs an alternative response team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2311.46)|
| 0:38:34| Unfortunately and horribly, that tragedy has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2314.46)|
| 0:38:40| In that incident, video showed police responding to a situation at a hospital that did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2320.46)|
| 0:38:46| need a police response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2326.46)|
| 0:38:48| The city had no other way for anyone to respond to that situation because we do not have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2328.46)|
| 0:38:55| alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2335.46)|
| 0:38:57| I want to acknowledge that our group has had conversations with city officials about alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2337.46)|
| 0:39:04| response for almost three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2344.46)|
| 0:39:08| At the end of all those conversations, the takeaway that we understood was that we, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2348.46)|
| 0:39:15| group of community volunteers, should go figure out how to do alternative response in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2355.46)|
| 0:39:21| and come back to the city when we got it all figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2361.46)|
| 0:39:24| That's not collaboration and it's certainly not leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2364.46)|
| 0:39:30| This year's budget proposes a reorganization of the Office of Empowerment and the Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2370.46)|
| 0:39:35| of Public Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2375.46)|
| 0:39:36| As that reorganization progresses, we believe that the new entity should be tasked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2376.46)|
| 0:39:42| finding a way to facilitate an alternative response program for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2382.46)|
| 0:39:47| That may mean helping to create a community-based nonprofit to run the program or creating a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2387.46)|
| 0:39:52| program within the city structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2392.46)|
| 0:39:54| Both models are used across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2394.46)|
| 0:39:56| Even as, tonight, city council is being asked to approve funding requests to federal agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2396.46)|
| 0:40:04| such as the U.S. Justice Department and the Housing and Urban Development for worthwhile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2404.46)|
| 0:40:08| violence prevention programs, city council has never been asked to approve such funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2408.46)|
| 0:40:14| requests for an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2414.46)|
| 0:40:17| That money has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2417.46)|
| 0:40:18| It's been sitting there in the federal government and the city has never asked for it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2418.46)|
| 0:40:23| we've never looked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2423.46)|
| 0:40:25| The city administration needs to make a public commitment to create an alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2425.46)|
| 0:40:29| team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2429.46)|
| 0:40:30| Specifically, we ask that city council refrain from approving this budget unless part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2430.46)|
| 0:40:36| the mandate of any reorganization of public safety offices includes a mandate to facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2436.46)|
| 0:40:42| the creation of an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2442.46)|
| 0:40:45| The city's public safety infrastructure deserves evidence-based best practices and the consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2445.46)|
| 0:40:51| is that an alternative response team meets that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2451.46)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2454.46)|

| 0:41:13| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2473.46)|
| 0:41:18| This budget process, we've had three years of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2478.46)|
| 0:41:24| We've watched things get pushed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2484.46)|
| 0:41:28| Same old, same old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2488.46)|
| 0:41:31| We don't have any way for the citizens of Knoxville, for the people of Knoxville, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2491.46)|
| 0:41:39| have direct input into this process and to actually state what the real priorities should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2499.46)|
| 0:41:47| be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2507.46)|
| 0:41:50| We've been through this over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2510.46)|
| 0:41:55| So we have people right now, right up the block, who are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2515.46)|
| 0:42:10| It's not hard to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2530.46)|
| 0:42:13| It's not hard to tell what's going on, but we've been doing this whole process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2533.46)|
| 0:42:18| same old, same old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2538.46)|
| 0:42:21| And if we haven't figured out that it's not working, then that means that a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2541.46)|
| 0:42:31| needs to be made in how we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2551.46)|
| 0:42:37| Bottom line is, the budget is a moral statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2557.46)|
| 0:42:42| It's about what you actually believe is important and who is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2562.46)|
| 0:42:48| I was raised to respond to what a need was, what people's needs were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2568.46)|
| 0:42:56| So when you see people in need and you see people in pain, you figure out how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2576.46)|
| 0:43:03| alleviate that situation as best you can with the resources that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2583.46)|
| 0:43:12| And the city of Knoxville has not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2592.46)|
| 0:43:15| At least it feels like there's nothing really happening here that will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2595.46)|
| 0:43:23| okay, we've got this opportunity to take care of this, to take care of people out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2603.46)|
| 0:43:30| on the street, to make sure we have affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2610.46)|
| 0:43:36| The resources are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2616.46)|
| 0:43:38| So the question is, are the priorities there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2618.46)|
| 0:43:40| Do you all actually believe it's a priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2620.46)|
| 0:43:43| If you don't, say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2623.46)|
| 0:43:46| Baseball stadium, that was a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2626.46)|
| 0:43:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2631.46)|
| 0:43:53| Bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2633.46)|
| 0:43:54| And we've gone through multiple scenarios now where the characterization of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2634.46)|
| 0:44:02| all that in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2642.46)|
| 0:44:05| I mean, we've had misrepresentation of the history behind it, what's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2645.46)|
| 0:44:10| happened, the people who have been negatively affected and are still being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2650.46)|
| 0:44:15| negatively affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2655.46)|
| 0:44:17| That type of thing we can't continue to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2657.46)|
| 0:44:22| I know you guys lay your plans out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2662.46)|
| 0:44:24| When I say you guys, you all come in and fill in a position and there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2664.46)|
| 0:44:30| You keep pushing the plan, whatever the plan was 30 years ago, 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2670.46)|
| 0:44:37| You guys are just pieces to put in and carry out the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2677.46)|
| 0:44:43| And the only person that's going to benefit are those who already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2683.46)|
| 0:44:48| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2688.46)|
| 0:44:50| And we've got to break this cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2690.46)|
| 0:44:52| If we don't, you're going to have just a group of haves and a group of have-nots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2692.46)|
| 0:44:58| In fact, I think we're already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2698.46)|
| 0:45:01| So I don't know what else to tell you to do except search your souls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2701.46)|
| 0:45:07| I said to you, Mayor, several years ago, City Council meeting, I watched you act up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2707.46)|
| 0:45:12| It was a Zoom meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2712.46)|
| 0:45:13| You acted up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2713.46)|
| 0:45:14| You were rude to Councilwoman Parker, outright rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2714.46)|
| 0:45:20| And I spoke to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2720.46)|
| 0:45:22| I said, you know, you need to have a change of heart, a change of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2722.46)|
| 0:45:31| Otherwise, you know, there's going to be a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2731.46)|
| 0:45:37| I've got 35 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2737.46)|
| 0:45:38| Chief, you've got to wake up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2738.46)|
| 0:45:43| I'm saying that respectfully, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2743.46)|
| 0:45:45| Knoxville is not New Orleans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2745.46)|
| 0:45:50| Man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2750.46)|
| 0:45:52| I'm frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2752.46)|
| 0:45:53| A lot of people are frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2753.46)|
| 0:45:55| Y'all need to know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2755.46)|
| 0:45:56| Y'all really need to know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2756.46)|
| 0:45:57| A lot of people are frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2757.46)|
| 0:45:58| And we don't know what else to do and say to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2758.46)|
| 0:46:01| We don't know, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2761.46)|
| 0:46:03| We can't get the truth from you, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2763.46)|
| 0:46:06| We asked for transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2766.46)|
| 0:46:07| You said you were going to give us transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2767.46)|
| 0:46:09| And what did you give us in the search process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2769.46)|
| 0:46:12| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2772.46)|
| 0:46:13| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2773.46)|
| 0:46:14| My time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2774.46)|
| 0:46:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2775.46)|
| 0:46:16| Councilmembers, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on this item of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2776.46)|
| 0:46:21| I wanted to first thank all of you for attending the State of the City last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2781.46)|
| 0:46:26| where I gave the broad highlights of the budget proposal that's before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2786.46)|
| 0:46:31| As Vice Mayor Roberto mentioned at the top of the meeting, we're ready to have a full hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2791.46)|
| 0:46:38| The legislative hearings are scheduled for all day next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2798.46)|
| 0:46:42| And so we will be ready to take any and all questions at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2802.46)|
| 0:46:48| Also, my deputies, Aaron Gill and David Brace, have reached out to each of you by email to invite you to set up meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2808.46)|
| 0:46:57| to go in detail with them either before Tuesday or after Tuesday, before the second reading of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2817.46)|
| 0:47:04| So I just wanted to thank you for attending the State of the City and participating in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2824.46)|
| 0:47:10| Also, Ms. Gill, if you could just take a minute to sort of the alternative response is an issue that has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2830.46)|
| 0:47:17| That's something that we have worked to try to address and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2837.46)|
| 0:47:23| So if you could just speak to the process we've followed so far on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2843.46)|
| 0:47:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2849.46)|
| 0:47:30| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2850.46)|
| 0:47:31| Aaron Gill, Deputy to Mayor McCannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2851.46)|
| 0:47:34| And yes, I think, Council, you've actually had a workshop on this, if you recall, back in June of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2854.46)|
| 0:47:40| And the action step that the City staff recommended at that time in partnership with McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2860.46)|
| 0:47:45| who of course is the core staff support for our co-responder program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2865.46)|
| 0:47:49| was to fund and complete the sequential intercept mapping process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2869.46)|
| 0:47:54| which informs where there are gaps in the existing system and what resources exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2874.46)|
| 0:47:59| And so that process was completed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2879.46)|
| 0:48:02| And alternative response, while it was considered one of the considerations of that workshop very specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2882.46)|
| 0:48:08| it did not emerge as one of the top recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2888.46)|
| 0:48:11| In light of that, as well as some of the ongoing priorities that we have related to standing up the new violence interruption program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2891.46)|
| 0:48:18| and knowing funding constraints as well, this budget does not include funding for alternative response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2898.46)|
| 0:48:24| but it does include the continued funding for, of course, community safety initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2904.46)|
| 0:48:28| including Turnip Knocks and, you know, continued discussion and the ability to continue to explore the types of programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2908.46)|
| 0:48:34| that can not only serve the community, but also help the police department focus on core law enforcement actions that they need to prioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2914.46)|
| 0:48:44| Thank you. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2924.46)|
| 0:48:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2930.46)|
| 0:48:54| I have a question, but I'm also needing to respond to what was just shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2934.46)|
| 0:49:02| And I'm not prepared enough to respond to it, but I remember that conversation about the sequential intercept mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2942.46)|
| 0:49:13| And essentially that's, you know, how to ensure those in our community struggling with mental health are not coming into contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2953.46)|
| 0:49:29| with the justice system unnecessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2969.46)|
| 0:49:33| And so I remember at the time arguing that the best way to ensure that is an alternative response model that doesn't use police in the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2973.46)|
| 0:49:42| So I'm still confused, and I would love to get the city's report or analysis that came out of that sequential intercept mapping process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2982.46)|
| 0:49:55| because how it does not lead us to alternative response when the point of it is supposed to be to keep folks with mental health challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=2995.46)|
| 0:50:05| out of the criminal justice system when there is no need, you know, when they have not committed a criminal act, but are simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3005.46)|
| 0:50:13| we're just relying on a criminal justice system because we don't have other tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3013.46)|
| 0:50:18| So I continue to support alternative response, and I hope that we as a city will actually do our due diligence around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3018.46)|
| 0:50:33| and put some thoughtful consideration into what this could do for our city, because I think it's desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3033.46)|
| 0:50:42| In terms of the budget, one question I had was looking at the, looking through it, you know, I compare it to older budgets because that's what helps me see things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3042.46)|
| 0:50:59| I did not see reserves budgeted in here, so I wanted to ask where do we find our reserves in this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3059.46)|
| 0:51:07| Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3067.46)|
| 0:51:08| The proposed budget is a balanced budget, and there is no unassigned fund balance that needs to be appropriated for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3068.46)|
| 0:51:18| That's why you don't see any mention of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3078.46)|
| 0:51:24| Wait, what? There's no unassigned fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3084.46)|
| 0:51:27| No, we have not, we are not proposing the appropriation of any unassigned fund balance dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3087.46)|
| 0:51:35| For reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3095.46)|
| 0:51:36| In other words, we're not dipping into our reserves, we're not dipping into our reserves to cover our operating budget for capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3096.46)|
| 0:51:43| But to budget a certain percentage of our budget to serve as our reserves and to have a balanced budget, would it not need to show up in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3103.46)|
| 0:51:57| Or are we not budgeting for reserves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3117.46)|
| 0:52:00| I'm thinking you may be thinking of the annual comprehensive financial report where we do lay out fund balance, the five different categories and what's in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3120.46)|
| 0:52:11| What we do in this, I mean what we do in the proposed budget is we talk about the sources of revenue in full and the expenditures that are going to be made and are being proposed in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3131.46)|
| 0:52:25| Those have to balance out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3145.46)|
| 0:52:27| So let me ask this, so our reserves are simply sitting in our unassigned fund balance and we don't include that like a 1.5% of our expenditures by policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3147.46)|
| 0:52:42| We are required by charter to set back between 1 and 5% of the general fund as a reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3162.46)|
| 0:52:53| That was something put in many, many years ago and we always put 1% aside in the budget for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3173.46)|
| 0:53:02| But that is, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3182.46)|
| 0:53:08| And unassigned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3188.46)|
| 0:53:11| Actually that would be committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3191.46)|
| 0:53:14| That would be in a category called committed because the legislative body at one time approved of that so it would have to be in what's called committed fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3194.46)|
| 0:53:26| So either it's in unassigned fund balance or it should show up here for us to be able to submit that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3206.46)|
| 0:53:32| Actually there's five categories of unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3212.46)|
| 0:53:35| You've got non-spendable, okay, which you can't touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3215.46)|
| 0:53:39| You've got restricted, which somebody's put restriction on you by a grantor or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3219.46)|
| 0:53:45| You've got committed, which means it's gone before this legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3225.46)|
| 0:53:49| At some point you put some rules in place so that that goes into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3229.46)|
| 0:53:53| For instance, not only that 1% but 20% of the general fund goes into what's called a stabilization account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3233.46)|
| 0:54:02| That's in committed fund balance because that was approved by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3242.46)|
| 0:54:07| Then you have what's called assigned, which are by practices put into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3247.46)|
| 0:54:12| And then you have unassigned fund balance, which essentially it's available for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3252.46)|
| 0:54:18| Now, when we are projecting right now ending this FY that we're currently in at right around $29 million in unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3258.46)|
| 0:54:30| We're not having to use any of it in this budget that's proposed before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3270.46)|
| 0:54:35| Ms. Parker, your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3275.46)|
| 0:54:38| You can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3278.46)|
| 0:54:40| Go to your other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3280.46)|
| 0:54:42| It's just to clarify because I really want this to not just be for me but for the public to better understand our processes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3282.46)|
| 0:54:49| So if we have a policy that says we need to budget 1%, put aside 1% of our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3289.46)|
| 0:54:56| I want to be able we can identify that and clarify that it's not in our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3296.46)|
| 0:55:01| but it's in our funds under our assigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3301.46)|
| 0:55:07| But can we just clarify that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3307.46)|
| 0:55:10| I think Mr. Evans just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3310.46)|
| 0:55:13| So we'll go to Mr. Smith, and if there's further clarity that he can provide, we will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3313.46)|
| 0:55:18| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3318.46)|
| 0:55:20| I had a lot of the same questions today, so I spent a half an hour trying to get clear on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3320.46)|
| 0:55:24| I think I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3324.46)|
| 0:55:26| The second part of this ordinance is providing the authority to reappropriate non-project-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3326.46)|
| 0:55:31| encumbrances at the end of this FY into the next FY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3331.46)|
| 0:55:35| That is correct, and that's a new part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3335.46)|
| 0:55:40| That is something we've started doing the last proposed budget for the fiscal of the year that we're in now, FY23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3340.46)|
| 0:55:48| and it's in this proposed budget for the upcoming FY24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3348.46)|
| 0:55:53| If you put that language in there, it's in the back of the, not the back of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3353.46)|
| 0:55:58| but it's after the numbers in the ordinance that you've got, the proposed budget ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3358.46)|
| 0:56:04| which basically gives us the authority to move monies around at the end of the fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3364.46)|
| 0:56:15| to balance out the various funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3375.46)|
| 0:56:17| For instance, if we fell short in, I don't know, special events, that office could very well happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3377.46)|
| 0:56:24| but we had some extra in, I'll say Tom, their engineering department, not in the capital stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3384.46)|
| 0:56:31| but in their operating, maybe we could move it over there, because you've got to balance your budget for state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3391.46)|
| 0:56:37| One thing about the departments and funds, I can tell you almost anything you want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3397.46)|
| 0:56:45| but one thing I can tell you for sure is none of them are going to be exactly where you thought they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3405.46)|
| 0:56:50| at the time you set forth the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3410.46)|
| 0:56:53| You're going to be over on some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3413.46)|
| 0:56:55| You're going to have less on some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3415.46)|
| 0:56:57| So you've got to balance that, and that part of this ordinance, I think it's paragraph 6, I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3417.46)|
| 0:57:04| gives us that authority, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3424.46)|
| 0:57:06| And so if we have surplus in revenues, well, let me back, just to replay that back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3426.46)|
| 0:57:14| At the end of this FY, between now and the end of the year, this is granting you authority to level load all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3434.46)|
| 0:57:20| to reflect all the departmental budgets the way they originally budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3440.46)|
| 0:57:24| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3444.46)|
| 0:57:25| Affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3445.46)|
| 0:57:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3446.46)|
| 0:57:27| And now I've forgotten my second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3447.46)|
| 0:57:31| I think you were talking about what's going to happen if, let's say there's excess revenues over expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3451.46)|
| 0:57:36| Yeah, it rains $5 million more than we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3456.46)|
| 0:57:38| Then those automatically go into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3458.46)|
| 0:57:41| Unassigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3461.46)|
| 0:57:42| Unassigned fund balance as it pertains to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3462.46)|
| 0:57:45| And we can only tap into those dollars if this body approves an alleged amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3465.46)|
| 0:57:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3469.46)|
| 0:57:50| We can't just spend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3470.46)|
| 0:57:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3471.46)|
| 0:57:52| We have to come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3472.46)|
| 0:57:53| So revenues are more than we projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3473.46)|
| 0:57:55| That goes into our savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3475.46)|
| 0:57:57| And if we want to use those, this body will approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3477.46)|
| 0:58:00| Affirmative, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3480.46)|
| 0:58:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3481.46)|
| 0:58:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3482.46)|
| 0:58:03| I had one more question about the alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3483.46)|
| 0:58:04| I do think, you know, I would like to discuss that more in our legislative meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3484.46)|
| 0:58:09| So I echo Councilman Parker's comments around data, specifically as it relates to the co-responder model to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3489.46)|
| 0:58:17| I remember, or at least maybe I read myself into the play, but I remember us discussing all the options, voting to proceed with this option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3497.46)|
| 0:58:27| but leaving the door open for the ability to be nimble and pivot more in a non-co-responder, alternative response only model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3507.46)|
| 0:58:39| So that data, I think, would be very welcome to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3519.46)|
| 0:58:43| Not to belabor the point now, but turn up knocks does violence interruption now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3523.46)|
| 0:58:52| Did they respond without a police officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3532.46)|
| 0:58:57| Turn up knocks does not respond to 911 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3537.46)|
| 0:59:01| Ms. Middlebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3541.46)|
| 0:59:03| Violence interruption and alternative response are two different models, and so when they engage, they are not engaging with police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3543.46)|
| 0:59:09| but it is not the same thing as alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3549.46)|
| 0:59:11| It's designed to do some very different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3551.46)|
| 0:59:13| Two different things, but turn up knocks does respond without police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3553.46)|
| 0:59:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3557.46)|
| 0:59:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3558.46)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3559.46)|
| 0:59:20| I would just add that turn up knocks did not exist a few years ago, and the city, and Ms. Middlebrook in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3560.46)|
| 0:59:27| has helped them establish themselves and create a nonprofit from scratch, and SEED has been really helpful in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3567.46)|
| 0:59:36| and that just takes a tremendous amount of work and capacity building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3576.46)|
| 0:59:41| So it's not that you can just flip a switch and say, let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3581.46)|
| 0:59:46| It takes a lot of training because we want to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3586.46)|
| 0:59:48| And similar with alternative response, to my knowledge, there is no existing entity in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3588.46)|
| 0:59:56| or in the nearby area who is ready, willing, and able to do the work similar to what we've heard about in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3596.46)|
| 1:00:03| So standing that up is something that could conceivably be done, but it's not easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3603.46)|
| 1:00:10| and it's not something that we've prioritized the violence interruption has been a higher priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3610.46)|
| 1:00:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3615.46)|
| 1:00:16| I'll just end by saying I think they're both similar in the sense that we're trying something new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3616.46)|
| 1:00:21| and we need just my opinion is that we need to remain nimble enough to adapt to what we learn from the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3621.46)|
| 1:00:27| and not feel restricted to whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3627.46)|
| 1:00:30| The same way we weren't restricted to what we did before, we should remain nimble and use data to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3630.46)|
| 1:00:37| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3637.46)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3639.46)|
| 1:00:40| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3640.46)|
| 1:00:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3641.46)|
| 1:00:42| Director Evans, since we're talking with you right now, just obviously we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3642.46)|
| 1:00:49| council's going to have our legislative budget hearings on May 9th, so we'll get into more detail here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3649.46)|
| 1:00:54| But just in general, how would you characterize the financial health of the city in this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3654.46)|
| 1:01:02| Just off the top of my head, I'd have to say financially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3662.46)|
| 1:01:06| By that I mean, yes, we're dealing with higher inflationary costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3666.46)|
| 1:01:10| but we've got sufficient unassigned fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3670.46)|
| 1:01:13| and a total fund balance to deal with any unforeseen circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3673.46)|
| 1:01:18| And we didn't have to use any unassigned fund balance to propose a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3678.46)|
| 1:01:25| So, no, we don't have money falling all over the place, but we're in a financially sound position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3685.46)|
| 1:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3691.46)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3692.46)|
| 1:01:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3693.46)|
| 1:01:34| And then, you know, just to the extent you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3694.46)|
| 1:01:36| can you talk to us a little bit about maybe like broad strokes about forecasting, projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3696.46)|
| 1:01:42| things that you're looking at in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3702.46)|
| 1:01:44| maybe in particular with trends you're seeing from the revenue side, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3704.46)|
| 1:01:49| Can you give us a little bit of a general look ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3709.46)|
| 1:01:52| Well, there's about four or five things that we really got into as we were forecasting this that were key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3712.46)|
| 1:02:01| One of them is inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3721.46)|
| 1:02:03| I mean, that's no surprise to anybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3723.46)|
| 1:02:06| You know, virtually all goods and services have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3726.46)|
| 1:02:10| Rising personnel costs, pay and benefits, those go up every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3730.46)|
| 1:02:15| We also looked at the increase in pension unfunded liability that we have to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3735.46)|
| 1:02:21| 2.35 million extra this coming FY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3741.46)|
| 1:02:26| Got less grant money, about 41 million less almost exactly than we did last FY,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3746.46)|
| 1:02:32| and if you look at our capital, proposed capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3752.46)|
| 1:02:35| you'll see that it's less by about that exact amount because we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3755.46)|
| 1:02:40| On kind of the positive side, or not kind of, it is positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3760.46)|
| 1:02:43| We do have increased property tax revenue from where this body, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3763.46)|
| 1:02:50| approved a tax increase of 36.5 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3770.46)|
| 1:02:53| and we've got increased sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3773.46)|
| 1:02:57| I had written down here right around 16.4 million more projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3777.46)|
| 1:03:03| if you combine local option and state shared sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3783.46)|
| 1:03:07| If you go from this current FY into what we're thinking it's going to be in the proposed budget for 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3787.46)|
| 1:03:13| So those were the key things that we had to forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3793.46)|
| 1:03:20| We forecast everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3800.46)|
| 1:03:21| You do a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3801.46)|
| 1:03:22| Those were primary drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3802.46)|
| 1:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3805.46)|
| 1:03:26| And you have, and you mentioned this I think in some answers to some earlier questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3806.46)|
| 1:03:31| but with regard to the economic stabilization fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3811.46)|
| 1:03:35| you've got that funded with the 20% that goes in, you know, by council resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3815.46)|
| 1:03:41| but then also the 5% best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3821.46)|
| 1:03:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3823.46)|
| 1:03:45| 20% in stabilization sound committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3825.46)|
| 1:03:48| The 5% goes into assigned best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3828.46)|
| 1:03:51| We don't touch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3831.46)|
| 1:03:52| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3832.46)|
| 1:03:53| That's not proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3833.46)|
| 1:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3835.46)|
| 1:03:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3836.46)|
| 1:03:57| And then, Mr. Frost, I wanted to turn real quickly to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3837.46)|
| 1:04:00| You had sent an email to council members just reminding us of the direction the charter gives us as to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3840.46)|
| 1:04:08| Just for, you know, folks at home, you know, can you just go over that real quickly with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3848.46)|
| 1:04:14| What is council to do per the charter with regard to first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3854.46)|
| 1:04:19| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3859.46)|
| 1:04:21| Section 901E is an echo of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3861.46)|
| 1:04:24| First sentence, the council shall pass the budget ordinance on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3864.46)|
| 1:04:29| and thereafter the council shall hold public hearings on the proposed operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3869.46)|
| 1:04:34| as well as the proposed, as well as the capital improvements budget, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3874.46)|
| 1:04:40| But the gist is council is compelled by the charter to pass the budget on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3880.46)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3886.46)|
| 1:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3888.46)|
| 1:04:49| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3889.46)|
| 1:04:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3892.46)|
| 1:04:53| I just want to follow, just go back to the alternative response conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3893.46)|
| 1:04:59| I know that we have not, to my knowledge, had an update on the co-responder unit as far as their data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3899.46)|
| 1:05:06| In the last probably eight to nine months, I think it would be good for us to be able to get an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3906.46)|
| 1:05:13| on how that unit is going, the number of calls, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3913.46)|
| 1:05:16| And then also just the cost for us to be able to run that unit and their hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3916.46)|
| 1:05:23| So we can take a more closer look at that versus alternative response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3923.46)|
| 1:05:28| knowing that, as Council Member Smith and Parker alluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3928.46)|
| 1:05:35| understanding that we should keep all options open as we look at mental health crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3935.46)|
| 1:05:41| those types of things that are increasing and the types of calls that we're receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3941.46)|
| 1:05:47| And so I think that would be good for council members to have that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3947.46)|
| 1:05:50| kind of level set in the conversations going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3950.46)|
| 1:05:53| Yeah, I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3953.46)|
| 1:05:55| I'll work with Chief Noel to see how fast we can gather that information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3955.46)|
| 1:05:59| I think it's also important, as you all know, since you've been working on mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3959.46)|
| 1:06:03| like the city can't do this alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3963.46)|
| 1:06:06| We need to work with our county and state officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3966.46)|
| 1:06:09| since it's actually under their purview to provide for the public health, including mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3969.46)|
| 1:06:14| We shouldn't let them off the hook of that obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3974.46)|
| 1:06:20| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3980.46)|
| 1:06:22| Oh, I'm sorry, Council Member McKenzie, did you have more? Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3982.46)|
| 1:06:25| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3985.46)|
| 1:06:26| I'd also like to know if we can get the number of calls where police have had to accompany| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3986.46)|
| 1:06:32| mobile crisis unit on calls, if that's available, versus the co-responder unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3992.46)|
| 1:06:38| Yeah, I think the mobile crisis unit is a little bit of a misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=3998.46)|
| 1:06:42| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4002.46)|
| 1:06:43| I don't know. We'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4003.46)|
| 1:06:45| My understanding is they don't go with police barely at all, and it's not really instant like a 911 call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4005.46)|
| 1:06:52| But we'll confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4012.46)|
| 1:06:55| That's my understanding from last time we asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4015.46)|
| 1:06:59| But I'll work with Chief Noel and Chief Sharp to gather that information for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4019.46)|
| 1:07:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4025.46)|
| 1:07:07| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4027.46)|
| 1:07:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4028.46)|
| 1:07:09| As you know, I'm a big supporter of the alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4029.46)|
| 1:07:13| What I am curious about is this question is for Ms. LaKenya and Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4033.46)|
| 1:07:18| You guys were on a panel, and from what Ms. Connolly said, you were both very much in support of a model like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4038.46)|
| 1:07:26| Can you just comment on what you think might be a good way for us to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4046.46)|
| 1:07:34| Ms. Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4054.46)|
| 1:07:37| Yes, and I did participate in that panel, and I believe what I said on that panel is that I am open to exploring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4057.46)|
| 1:07:44| how we may be able to engage something like alternative response in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4064.46)|
| 1:07:49| I do see value in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4069.46)|
| 1:07:51| I also recognize that we have limited capacity in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4071.46)|
| 1:07:55| And as we look at models, a lot of times and part of, I think, where some of the delay has come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4075.46)|
| 1:08:02| and these are conversations that we have had with HEART, is there was some misunderstanding on each end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4082.46)|
| 1:08:09| I believe, as to how the work was going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4089.46)|
| 1:08:13| I thought that we had come to some more understanding about that, and we're looking to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4093.46)|
| 1:08:18| and I'm eager to continue those conversations about how we can potentially move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4098.46)|
| 1:08:25| in engaging similar work as we explore what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4105.46)|
| 1:08:30| At this point, we have, as Mayor Fincannon said, prioritized violence reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4110.46)|
| 1:08:36| as we have seen significant increases in violence in our community and have put our resources there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4116.46)|
| 1:08:42| And, as Ms. Gill stated, in the participation in the sequential intercept mapping process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4122.46)|
| 1:08:48| with service providers who are engaging in this work at various levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4128.46)|
| 1:08:54| there was a lot of interest expressed in continuing to explore how to build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4134.46)|
| 1:09:01| and better resource the co-responder model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4141.46)|
| 1:09:05| And so we have been listening to service providers in the community around how to better engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4145.46)|
| 1:09:12| But I am, as everyone here has said, open to exploring all options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4152.46)|
| 1:09:16| and keeping all options on the table as we look at how to best serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4156.46)|
| 1:09:22| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4162.46)|
| 1:09:24| I think this isn't an exact overlap with violence prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4164.46)|
| 1:09:29| To me, what this model works on is our mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4169.46)|
| 1:09:32| and as we've been using the police as social workers to make house calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4172.46)|
| 1:09:38| I think it would actually help the police department for us to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4178.46)|
| 1:09:41| But, Chief Noel, I'd love to hear your opinions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4181.46)|
| 1:09:45| Well, as I said in the panel, I really think working with the violence interrupters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4185.46)|
| 1:09:51| and turn up knocks has been very beneficial to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4191.46)|
| 1:09:54| I believe in the co-responder program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4194.46)|
| 1:09:56| I'm absolutely committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4196.46)|
| 1:09:58| I'm committed to programs like law enforcement diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4198.46)|
| 1:10:00| The other side of things, just the reality of it is that police and fire respond to a very high volume of calls to service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4200.46)|
| 1:10:09| And any model that comes out of that is going to require a lot of staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4209.46)|
| 1:10:14| So I'm not just like Director Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4214.46)|
| 1:10:16| I'm not opposed to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4216.46)|
| 1:10:17| I'm open to working with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4217.46)|
| 1:10:19| But the reality of it is that we do respond to a high volume of calls, not only police but fire department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4219.46)|
| 1:10:27| May I ask Ms. Connolly a question, if you're still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4227.46)|
| 1:10:34| Hi. I know we talked about this a couple years ago, but please refresh my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4234.46)|
| 1:10:38| The models that you looked at, were those models run by the police departments, the city, or non-profits that were separate entities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4238.46)|
| 1:10:46| They're some of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4246.46)|
| 1:10:48| And what we would be looking to do is engage with the city, because as Chief Noel is alluding to, in most models, the calls run through 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4248.46)|
| 1:10:58| So the city has to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4258.46)|
| 1:10:59| This is not something that can be done outside the structure of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4259.46)|
| 1:11:03| So it has to involve the partnership with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4263.46)|
| 1:11:06| So we would welcome that opportunity, and we feel like we've not been as well received as we would like, but we look forward to working in partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4266.46)|
| 1:11:16| Have you had a chance to have a conversation with Knox County, because 911 covers both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4276.46)|
| 1:11:22| We talked to fire department. Is that both Knox County andâ€”no, it's just the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4282.46)|
| 1:11:28| We've talkedâ€”no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4288.46)|
| 1:11:30| So that's something that we should probably do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4290.46)|
| 1:11:33| If someone's that brave, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4293.46)|
| 1:11:35| Thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4295.46)|
| 1:11:37| And thank you for bringing this topic up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4297.46)|
| 1:11:39| I just jumped on the bandwagon of this, because we don't have this conversation often enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4299.46)|
| 1:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4304.46)|
| 1:11:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4305.46)|
| 1:11:46| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4306.46)|
| 1:11:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4309.46)|
| 1:11:52| I also had concerns about Section 6, which Councilmember Smith brought up and wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4312.46)|
| 1:12:00| You know, the public is very interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4320.46)|
| 1:12:02| We are very interested in our budgeting process and how we, through this process as city council people, can review the budget and, as allowed by charter, make potential changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4322.46)|
| 1:12:20| And the way I read Section 6, it seems like it would be possible for us to amend the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4340.46)|
| 1:12:32| but then this would give the administration authority to essentially move that funding back to where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4352.46)|
| 1:12:43| the administration wants that funding to be after not spending the funding for a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4363.46)|
| 1:12:50| Could anyone speak to whether this passage, Section 6, would allow that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4370.46)|
| 1:12:56| I'm not sure I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4376.46)|
| 1:12:58| Can you ask it again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4378.46)|
| 1:12:59| If we amended the budget and, say, moved, you know, $50,000 from animal control to stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4379.46)|
| 1:13:14| would this language on page 359 under Section 6 allow the administration to, you know, not spend that $50,000 and then move it back to the previous fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4394.46)|
| 1:13:34| I don't know if Mr. Swanson can correct me if he thinks I'm incorrect here, but I don't think so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4414.46)|
| 1:13:40| because it has the statement in there within their respective funds, and stormwater is a special revenue fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4420.46)|
| 1:13:50| So, in other words, you can move funds around like within the general fund, but you can't get into special revenue funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4430.46)|
| 1:13:57| So not on that example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4437.46)|
| 1:13:59| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4439.46)|
| 1:14:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4440.46)|
| 1:14:01| Let me switch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4441.46)|
| 1:14:02| What if we moved it from, you know, finance to public services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4442.46)|
| 1:14:07| Mr. Swanson may be able to add his two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4447.46)|
| 1:14:11| Mr. Evans, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4451.46)|
| 1:14:13| And this is for, in other words, after the, okay, this is the proposed budget ordinance for FY24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4453.46)|
| 1:14:22| After FY24 is over, this has given us the ability to move funds around at that time as we start doing year-end closeout to balance out the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4462.46)|
| 1:14:35| This would not open it up to moving it around right now before even the first reading of the budget or second reading is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4475.46)|
| 1:14:46| This is after the budget is approved, adopted, and then as we go through that year and we get to the end of it and we see, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4486.46)|
| 1:14:53| we're short a little here, over a little there, we can fix it within the respective funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4493.46)|
| 1:14:58| That's always been my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4498.46)|
| 1:15:00| And so is there anything, you know, let's say in engineering we budget $8 million for engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4500.46)|
| 1:15:13| but spending is at $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4513.46)|
| 1:15:20| You know, I'm trying to understand how you get to a scenario where at the end of the year you need to balance the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4520.46)|
| 1:15:28| Like when are you allowed to go above and beyond what's been budgeted already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4528.46)|
| 1:15:33| Well, we don't go above and beyond what's in a particular fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4533.46)|
| 1:15:41| That's got to be approved by this body by a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4541.46)|
| 1:15:47| But normally, like let's take the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4547.46)|
| 1:15:50| That's usually where you've got the most issues, and generally they're small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4550.46)|
| 1:15:55| Let's say fire, Chief Sharp hit next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4555.46)|
| 1:16:00| He's a little bit over budget for something or a myriad of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4560.46)|
| 1:16:05| And Chief Noel with KPD is, you know, they've got some additional money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4565.46)|
| 1:16:12| At the end of the FY, as we're closing it out, got the audit going on, then we would balance it out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4572.46)|
| 1:16:20| But that's for the, those are for the exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4580.46)|
| 1:16:23| They're always going to be a little bit, but, you know, we keep an eye on it through the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4583.46)|
| 1:16:27| so there's not huge surprises at the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4587.46)|
| 1:16:34| So back to my question, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4594.46)|
| 1:16:39| Would we be, within the general fund, if we move money around within the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4599.46)|
| 1:16:49| would the administration be able to, you know, not follow what council has voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4609.46)|
| 1:17:01| and not spend those dollars under a certain fund, but maintain the dollars in the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4621.46)|
| 1:17:06| and move it to other spending priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4626.46)|
| 1:17:10| Yeah, I think I'm going to have the law director try to field this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4630.46)|
| 1:17:13| and then we'll, since the five minutes are up, we'll go on to the next person who had their light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4633.46)|
| 1:17:19| I think that really gets back to, you can, as we have discussed, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4639.46)|
| 1:17:29| take $50,000 away from the police department, give it to the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4649.46)|
| 1:17:34| But you can't say specifically how those funds are to be spent within that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4654.46)|
| 1:17:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4659.46)|
| 1:17:40| So what you could do is take $50,000 away from the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4660.46)|
| 1:17:46| give $50,000 more to the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4666.46)|
| 1:17:50| They would be in those departments, and the department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4670.46)|
| 1:17:55| and the administration would decide whether or how to spend those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4675.46)|
| 1:18:00| And if you came to the end of the year and you still had that $50,000 discrepancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4680.46)|
| 1:18:07| then the finance department would true up, if somebody's over budget by some amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4687.46)|
| 1:18:14| they would true up the funds there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4694.46)|
| 1:18:19| I don't think it would accomplish what you're suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4699.46)|
| 1:18:26| I guess cynically you could try to do that, but that would be a really poor way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4706.46)|
| 1:18:32| A better way to go about it would be to appropriate the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4712.46)|
| 1:18:38| and put them back in the department you want them in if you want to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4718.46)|
| 1:18:43| For example, if that amendment happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4723.46)|
| 1:18:49| then the administration throughout the year could propose an amendment to the budget again to ship those funds back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4729.46)|
| 1:18:57| But if you don't, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4737.46)|
| 1:18:59| That's your area of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4739.46)|
| 1:19:04| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4744.46)|
| 1:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4746.46)|
| 1:19:08| Mr. Evans, just for citizen help and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4748.46)|
| 1:19:14| when we talked about the money that is set aside by a charter that has to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4754.46)|
| 1:19:21| where does that show up in this book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4761.46)|
| 1:19:24| You won't find it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4764.46)|
| 1:19:26| It used to be years ago that we would talk about the 1% and say it's set aside a reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4766.46)|
| 1:19:34| I think you can look back to some old budgets and see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4774.46)|
| 1:19:39| It was kind of silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4779.46)|
| 1:19:42| It's got nothing to do with anything because we never used it ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4782.46)|
| 1:19:47| So what happens is we are maintaining that 1% and our required reserves just like we always are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4787.46)|
| 1:19:58| we report on those as part of the audit when we do the annual comprehensive financial report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4798.46)|
| 1:20:06| That's where you find all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4806.46)|
| 1:20:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4807.46)|
| 1:20:08| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4808.46)|
| 1:20:09| I was just trying to help clarify why citizens won't see anything about the reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4809.46)|
| 1:20:16| or what the charter says in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4816.46)|
| 1:20:19| This document is only for the amount of money that we can spend this fiscal year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4819.46)|
| 1:20:27| What we believe is going to come in and what we propose going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4827.46)|
| 1:20:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4830.46)|
| 1:20:31| And so we're just budgeting based on the revenues that we know we can spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4831.46)|
| 1:20:37| whether they're assigned or unassigned, to actually make the government function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4837.46)|
| 1:20:43| not necessarily have our savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4843.46)|
| 1:20:46| We're not putting that on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4846.46)|
| 1:20:48| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4848.46)|
| 1:20:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4849.46)|
| 1:20:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4850.46)|
| 1:20:51| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4851.46)|
| 1:20:52| And what I understood Councilwoman Parker asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4852.46)|
| 1:20:56| I would assume based on my experience that when budgets are trued up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4856.46)|
| 1:21:02| it's really not significant amounts of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4862.46)|
| 1:21:06| So if it were, if council said we want to move $2 million somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4866.46)|
| 1:21:12| it couldn't just sit there and then come back at the end of the year to be trued up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4872.46)|
| 1:21:17| That would have to take a budget amendment, I assume, to move money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4877.46)|
| 1:21:21| That significantly from one department to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4881.46)|
| 1:21:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4885.46)|
| 1:21:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4886.46)|
| 1:21:27| That doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4887.46)|
| 1:21:28| I'll just give you an example, real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4888.46)|
| 1:21:30| One of the only times I've ever seen revenue kind of significantly exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4890.46)|
| 1:21:35| expenditures where we had some extra and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4895.46)|
| 1:21:38| If you'll remember when the pandemic was about to hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4898.46)|
| 1:21:43| and it was coming from other places in the world to the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4903.46)|
| 1:21:46| and we got together and we thought we're not going to make anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4906.46)|
| 1:21:50| in some of these revenue areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4910.46)|
| 1:21:52| Well, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4912.46)|
| 1:21:53| Much to our surprise, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4913.46)|
| 1:21:55| At the end of that, no, we didn't spend all that or reallocate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4915.46)|
| 1:21:59| It just goes into unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4919.46)|
| 1:22:01| That's where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4921.46)|
| 1:22:04| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4924.46)|
| 1:22:06| Just to keep on this line for a minute, using the two departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4926.46)|
| 1:22:12| well, let me ask this question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4932.46)|
| 1:22:14| In Section VI, it says respective funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4934.46)|
| 1:22:17| Am I to interpret that as departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4937.46)|
| 1:22:20| No, funds are different from departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4940.46)|
| 1:22:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4942.46)|
| 1:22:23| There's different types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4943.46)|
| 1:22:24| There's proprietary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4944.46)|
| 1:22:26| There's special revenue funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4946.46)|
| 1:22:28| There's the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4948.46)|
| 1:22:30| I mean, there's various types that are set out in governmental accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4950.46)|
| 1:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4953.46)|
| 1:22:34| So the second question is, using the two departments earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4954.46)|
| 1:22:37| if special events overspent a million dollars this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4957.46)|
| 1:22:45| and engineering underspent a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4965.46)|
| 1:22:48| where would this body see that before the true up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4968.46)|
| 1:22:54| Well, you would see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4974.46)|
| 1:22:58| If it was a million dollars in, like, special events, first off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4978.46)|
| 1:23:04| we're going to see that coming a mile away, and if it's important enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4984.46)|
| 1:23:08| we're going to have to come and put a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4988.46)|
| 1:23:11| Yeah, okay, $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4991.46)|
| 1:23:12| Sure, whatever the money number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4992.46)|
| 1:23:13| Where would they see the discrepancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4993.46)|
| 1:23:15| Well, in that instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4995.46)|
| 1:23:16| you would see that in a budget amendment that would come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4996.46)|
| 1:23:19| If it was something as small as taking a million out of the picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=4999.46)|
| 1:23:22| and say, yeah, $1,000 or $2,000, it would not come before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5002.46)|
| 1:23:26| That would just be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5006.46)|
| 1:23:28| That's what this is giving us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5008.46)|
| 1:23:29| That's what this is to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5009.46)|
| 1:23:30| But what is the true up, as Mr. Swanson said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5010.46)|
| 1:23:33| My next question is, what is that threshold between a million and $1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5013.46)|
| 1:23:38| Is there a specific one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5018.46)|
| 1:23:39| There is not a specific one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5019.46)|
| 1:23:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5021.46)|
| 1:23:43| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5023.46)|
| 1:23:45| I just have one other question, and then I'm going to try a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5025.46)|
| 1:23:52| My last question is, before our public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5032.46)|
| 1:24:00| I'd really like to get all of the an accounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5040.46)|
| 1:24:09| of the capital expenditures that have been appropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5049.46)|
| 1:24:18| but not yet fully expended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5058.46)|
| 1:24:21| Would that be possible to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5061.46)|
| 1:24:23| especially with our new fancy finance software that we've invested in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5063.46)|
| 1:24:28| Ms. Parker, we're recording that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5068.46)|
| 1:24:32| and we'll try to have some answers by Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5072.46)|
| 1:24:35| That would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5075.46)|
| 1:24:37| And then just a motion I wanted to make was that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5077.46)|
| 1:24:41| and postpone the second reading of the budget ordinance and tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5081.46)|
| 1:24:47| We'll get to the tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5087.46)|
| 1:24:49| Ms. Parker, it's been suggested to me by the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5089.46)|
| 1:24:53| that you all could vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5093.46)|
| 1:24:54| and then afterwards have a separate motion to postpone the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5094.46)|
| 1:24:58| Oh, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5098.46)|
| 1:24:59| You wouldn't close it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5099.46)|
| 1:25:00| You shouldn't postpone the second reading until you pass the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5100.46)|
| 1:25:06| I thought we would essentially be amending the AIS in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5106.46)|
| 1:25:10| No, because you're not postponing the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5110.46)|
| 1:25:15| I promise I'll call on you after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5115.46)|
| 1:25:18| and see if you want to make that motion at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5118.46)|
| 1:25:25| There is a motion right now on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5125.46)|
| 1:25:27| Are there any further questions or discussion on the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5127.46)|
| 1:25:31| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5131.46)|
| 1:25:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5133.46)|

| 1:25:35| Motion carries 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5135.46)|
| 1:25:39| Now, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5139.46)|
| 1:25:41| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5141.46)|
| 1:25:42| Following the last meeting, you all discussed your interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5142.46)|
| 1:25:46| in possibly delaying the second reading by two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5146.46)|
| 1:25:49| so now would be the time to entertain a motion to allow that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5149.46)|
| 1:25:54| and postpone the second reading to May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5154.46)|
| 1:25:57| Is there anyone who wishes to make such a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5157.46)|
| 1:26:00| I'd like to make a motion to postpone the second reading to May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5160.46)|
| 1:26:04| Motion is made to postpone the second reading of the budget until May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5164.46)|
| 1:26:07| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5167.46)|

| 1:26:18| Now we'll move on to Item 12B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5178.46)|
| 1:26:21| and I will entertain a similar motion assuming you guys pass 12B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5181.46)|
| 1:26:26| to postpone the second reading to have both A and B discussed at the same agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5186.46)|
| 1:26:33| That seems to make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5193.46)|
| 1:26:36| All right, 12B, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5196.46)|
| 1:26:38| 12B is an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties, real, personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5198.46)|

| 1:27:14| just to keep the two items together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5234.46)|
| 1:27:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5236.46)|
| 1:27:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5238.46)|

| 1:28:01| Mr. Marlowe, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5281.46)|
| 1:28:06| Hi, I'm Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas Avenue, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5286.46)|
| 1:28:11| I'm just here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5291.46)|
| 1:28:12| I would like to continue to raise the issue that we are in the midst of a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5292.46)|
| 1:28:18| This past week I listed a one-bedroom house for rent on Zillow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5298.46)|
| 1:28:23| and within 48 hours I was inundated with over 60-some-odd emails, phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5303.46)|
| 1:28:27| and by 72 hours I had over a dozen pre-approved applications paid for, submitted, and reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5307.46)|
| 1:28:34| I told everyone I would take them in the order of the approved applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5314.46)|
| 1:28:38| and I had an open house for everyone to have an opportunity to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5318.46)|
| 1:28:41| I arrived exactly on time, and there was already over a dozen people waiting on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5321.46)|
| 1:28:49| It was incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5329.46)|
| 1:28:51| I have never seen such desperation in a First World country in my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5331.46)|
| 1:28:57| It very much felt like when I visited Cambodia or other places in the Third World country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5337.46)|
| 1:29:03| just how desperate people were for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5343.46)|
| 1:29:05| I had a young couple that showed up with years' worth of bank statements, paycheck stubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5345.46)|
| 1:29:10| letters of recommendations from their neighbors, their church leaders, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5350.46)|
| 1:29:16| It's uncalled for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5356.46)|
| 1:29:20| I've been part of the Developers' Roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5360.46)|
| 1:29:24| I've been vocal here for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5364.46)|
| 1:29:26| There's a lot of very simple things like erasing the ward map that would go a long ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5366.46)|
| 1:29:31| ending a lot of the red tape, the micromanagement going on in Stormwater, and planning some review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5371.46)|
| 1:29:37| What's really shocking is I met with Cheryl Ball last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5377.46)|
| 1:29:42| I had an idea that came directly from the missing middle report that we've spent money on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5382.46)|
| 1:29:47| that we claim that we're involved in and engaged in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5387.46)|
| 1:29:51| and I wanted to upzone a large lot that's nonconforming with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5391.46)|
| 1:29:55| that was forced to be large because of ward map issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5395.46)|
| 1:29:59| Now it's this huge 10,200 or so square feet lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5399.46)|
| 1:30:04| I want to upzone it to RN4 so that I could get five dwelling units as a multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5404.46)|
| 1:30:09| instead of one single house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5409.46)|
| 1:30:13| I went through the application process to go through the upzoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5413.46)|
| 1:30:17| and I was told by planning, MPC, whatever it's called these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5417.46)|
| 1:30:22| that I needed to talk to Brian Berry, so I had a nice lengthy conversation with Brian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5422.46)|
| 1:30:26| and it's actually impossible, impossible for us to do a cottage courtyard development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5426.46)|
| 1:30:32| that was recommended and suggested by the missing middle under our current zoning rubrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5432.46)|
| 1:30:38| We looked at every which way to try to find some gray area, some wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5438.46)|
| 1:30:42| It's impossible, just flat out impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5442.46)|
| 1:30:46| What could I do if I wanted increased density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5446.46)|
| 1:30:48| I could upzone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5448.46)|
| 1:30:50| I could tear down the historic home that's there that I'm trying to save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5450.46)|
| 1:30:53| I could cut down the two mature pecan trees that I'm trying to save,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5453.46)|
| 1:30:58| and then I could build this monstrosity of a single building that has five dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5458.46)|
| 1:31:03| that would be totally out of character, but that's the only way that I could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5463.46)|
| 1:31:08| the five dwelling units on that property under our current zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5468.46)|
| 1:31:12| But then that seems to be counterintuitive with all of our historic preservation efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5472.46)|
| 1:31:18| our tree canopy efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5478.46)|
| 1:31:20| It's like you have a developer who lives in the neighborhood who is trying his damnedest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5480.46)|
| 1:31:24| to improve that neighborhood and to, at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5484.46)|
| 1:31:27| honor the historical significance and historical character of that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5487.46)|
| 1:31:32| to be true to our environmental efforts with our tree canopy and saving mature trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5492.46)|
| 1:31:37| and trying to address our housing crisis, and it's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5497.46)|
| 1:31:41| And it's impossible because of regulations that have been imposed by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5501.46)|
| 1:31:46| not necessarily you guys, but previous members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5506.46)|
| 1:31:49| The only way to fix it, and literally Brian and I came to a conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5509.46)|
| 1:31:53| that either I could rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5513.46)|
| 1:31:58| By rezoning it, all I could do is have two single family homes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5518.46)|
| 1:32:02| Well, what about an ADU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5522.46)|
| 1:32:04| Wait to rezone it, rebuild the historic house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5524.46)|
| 1:32:07| change my driver's license address to say that it's my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5527.46)|
| 1:32:11| so that I could then get a permit to do the ADU in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5531.46)|
| 1:32:15| And then once that's complete, I could then rezone it to RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5535.46)|
| 1:32:18| then come back and ask for permission to put a second single family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5538.46)|
| 1:32:22| and that's it, three dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5542.46)|
| 1:32:24| and about a year's worth of running around bureaucratic red tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5544.46)|
| 1:32:29| Or, as I said, look, the market's going to find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5549.46)|
| 1:32:32| I'll just fix the house, change my address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5552.46)|
| 1:32:36| get the permission to build an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5556.46)|
| 1:32:40| and then put an 8-foot privacy fence around it and catch me if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5560.46)|
| 1:32:43| I'll stick the three tiny homes I want to put back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5563.46)|
| 1:32:45| They just won't have separate meters, but I will address housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5565.46)|
| 1:32:49| And he told me that he knows that that's going on all throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5569.46)|
| 1:32:54| So are we in a housing crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5574.46)|
| 1:32:58| Am I the only one that sees it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5578.46)|
| 1:33:00| And are we going to do anything about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5580.46)|
| 1:33:02| Because it's going to require an ordinance change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5582.46)|
| 1:33:05| and we need this ordinance change today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5585.46)|
| 1:33:07| Declare an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5587.46)|
| 1:33:08| I mean, I believe it's an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5588.46)|
| 1:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5591.46)|
| 1:33:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5592.46)|
| 1:33:13| Next person signed up to speak is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5593.46)|
| 1:33:15| Mr. Roach, you have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5595.46)|
| 1:33:20| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5600.46)|
| 1:33:23| Good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5603.46)|
| 1:33:26| Man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5606.46)|
| 1:33:29| Whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5609.46)|
| 1:33:32| Mr. Marlowe really pointed out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5612.46)|
| 1:33:39| Whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5619.46)|
| 1:33:42| Mr. Marlowe really pointed out something that brought back a memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5622.46)|
| 1:33:52| It's at First Tennessee Bank, and it's part of a housing task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5632.46)|
| 1:34:00| We did our homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5640.46)|
| 1:34:03| and I finally had a vice president of First Tennessee in this meeting say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5643.46)|
| 1:34:10| Mr. Roach, yeah, we're in a housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5650.46)|
| 1:34:15| affordable housing crisis right now here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5655.46)|
| 1:34:19| This was seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5659.46)|
| 1:34:22| And then we had a follow-up meeting about four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5662.46)|
| 1:34:28| Same response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5668.46)|
| 1:34:30| Nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5670.46)|
| 1:34:32| We've only done a new zoning thing called recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5672.46)|
| 1:34:38| and it makes it harder on just the average person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5678.46)|
| 1:34:42| And those who are already being hit hard by the financial circumstances out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5682.46)|
| 1:34:48| in the world makes it harder for them to access not just affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5688.46)|
| 1:34:56| not just rental housing, but a home that they own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5696.46)|
| 1:35:03| That means they can't access financial resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5703.46)|
| 1:35:08| Let's go east of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5708.46)|
| 1:35:11| Let's go east of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5711.46)|
| 1:35:15| What's the financial situation right now as far as people having access to funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5715.46)|
| 1:35:24| financial institution, so that they can, if they have a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5724.46)|
| 1:35:30| they have the resources to purchase a home if that is what they desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5730.46)|
| 1:35:38| And, you know, the American dream says buy your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5738.46)|
| 1:35:43| Well, right now we're doing affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5743.46)|
| 1:35:45| and it's nothing but rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5745.46)|
| 1:35:47| If you don't have access to financial resources or if it's very hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5747.46)|
| 1:35:52| and let's be true about this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5752.46)|
| 1:35:54| Let's be true about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5754.46)|
| 1:35:56| Right now, Knoxville, Knox County, is the prime example of discriminatory practices in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5756.46)|
| 1:36:05| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5765.46)|
| 1:36:06| Financial institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5766.46)|
| 1:36:08| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5768.46)|
| 1:36:09| And it's going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5769.46)|
| 1:36:10| I think a lot of people already know it, but nothing's being done to alleviate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5770.46)|
| 1:36:15| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5775.46)|
| 1:36:17| So black folk in Knoxville, it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5777.46)|
| 1:36:22| Let's reference National Community Reinvestment Coalition, NCRC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5782.46)|
| 1:36:29| You reference them and all the information that they have just on the East Tennessee market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5789.46)|
| 1:36:36| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5796.46)|
| 1:36:37| Financial institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5797.46)|
| 1:36:39| Black folk are getting shut out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5799.46)|
| 1:36:42| Shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5802.46)|
| 1:36:44| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5804.46)|
| 1:36:45| And it's discriminatory practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5805.46)|
| 1:36:47| If you remove brick-and-mortar locations right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5807.46)|
| 1:36:52| if you remove brick-and-mortar locations from a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5812.46)|
| 1:36:57| and people can't go and sit down and talk to a local banker, finance person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5817.46)|
| 1:37:06| and say, hey, we want to get this loan for our mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5826.46)|
| 1:37:10| and we want to stay in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5830.46)|
| 1:37:14| We want to continue to live in an area that we're used to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5834.46)|
| 1:37:20| more than likely it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5840.46)|
| 1:37:23| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5843.46)|
| 1:37:24| It's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5844.46)|

| 1:38:50| Where do I begin today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5930.46)|
| 1:38:54| For Mariah and for everybody else here, Tommy Smith told a little truth tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5934.46)|
| 1:39:01| He's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5941.46)|
| 1:39:03| We had a vote on Hart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5943.46)|
| 1:39:04| It came to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5944.46)|
| 1:39:06| At the same time, Seema was supposed to bring in $4 million from other resources that she vacated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5946.46)|
| 1:39:10| And Amelia had to be the courageous voice and bring back the original $4,000 to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5950.46)|
| 1:39:15| But he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5955.46)|
| 1:39:16| Y'all voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5956.46)|
| 1:39:18| And you shot it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5958.46)|
| 1:39:20| And chose the alternative response program with the co-responder instead, which was a watered-down version of what we really asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5960.46)|
| 1:39:28| Because let's be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5968.46)|
| 1:39:29| That's what you're really good at, Knoxville, watering down versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5969.46)|
| 1:39:33| More importantly, performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5973.46)|
| 1:39:35| Because what I've sat here and watched tonight, if you watch a live feed in Knoxville, you would think this city is conducting business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5975.46)|
| 1:39:41| But that ain't true at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5981.46)|
| 1:39:42| Because let's be real, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5982.46)|
| 1:39:44| You ain't got to bring in no national council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5984.46)|
| 1:39:46| You can keep this data simple for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5986.46)|
| 1:39:49| We know for a fact that racism and white supremacy is a key part of the discrimination of housing in Knoxville, especially when you look at black communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5989.46)|
| 1:39:57| I am just blown away by the black faces of white supremacy who thought it was appropriate to let stolen black land be built with condominiums that start at $2,500 a month in front of the black neighborhoods that they are removing and erasing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=5997.46)|
| 1:40:13| And then had the audacity to name it after pioneer civil rights leaders of Yardley and Delaney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6013.46)|
| 1:40:20| How more insane and psychotic, more importantly sociopathic, can you be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6020.46)|
| 1:40:25| Like, be for real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6025.46)|
| 1:40:27| Like the Renee Kesslers and the Gwen McKenzie's and the LaKenya Middlebrooks and the Denzel Grants and the Charles Lomax's and the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6027.46)|
| 1:40:35| Hey, guess where Lois Phyllis, I mean Phyllis Nichols work at now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6035.46)|

| 1:40:46| Hey, Tommy Smith, real quick, another knowledgeable tip for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6046.46)|
| 1:40:49| The reason why the violence interruption team turn up Knox don't need the police because they're deputies of the police, which by the way is the only type of program I've been able to find in black America doing such violence interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6049.46)|
| 1:41:03| So again, watered down versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6063.46)|
| 1:41:05| So they're like the UTK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6065.46)|
| 1:41:07| All they got to do is apprehend and then they pull up or the Knox County Sheriff pull up and then they formally charge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6067.46)|
| 1:41:12| That's why they don't need the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6072.46)|
| 1:41:14| They are the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6074.46)|
| 1:41:16| That's a dangerous game y'all playing because these boys really are out here shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6076.46)|

| 1:41:34| Thomas, you don't know what we protesting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6094.46)|
| 1:41:36| That has taken bribes and other things of extortion for this baseball station she's dumping in our community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6096.46)|
| 1:41:42| Who are you to judge character of anything whatsoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6102.46)|

| 1:41:49| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6109.46)|
| 1:41:50| And so this is why Knoxville for everybody came to this podium and begged on your knees and cried for help and mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230502?start=6110.46)|
