| 0:00:00| a good debate on the issue at hand. So, I'd like to make a few introductions. I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| to introduce you to the chair of the Knox County Commission and my district mate, Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=8)|
| 0:00:12| Tank Strickland. Bob Roundtree represents the 6th District. He, as well as myself, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=12)|
| 0:00:21| an appointee. Dr. Richard Briggs represents the 5th District. Appointed Sheriff in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=21)|
| 0:00:30| back of the room, Jimmy J. J. Jones. And I don't think I'm missing out on anyone. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| introduce my wife, Gwen. So, thank you all for coming again. I'd like to just have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=38)|
| 0:00:50| dialogue about these proposed charter amendments. The people from Knox County Petition agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=50)|
| 0:01:01| or disagree, have been very, very accommodating in following us around. As we have, each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=61)|
| 0:01:09| has an open forum that they've been really good about showing up, taking easy questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=69)|
| 0:01:15| taking the tough questions, talking with people for as long as they would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| talk about it. So, again, thank them for coming. And the way I'd like to do it is to have Lawrence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=79)|
| 0:01:27| Selleck kind of give a brief discussion on the process, the timeline. I think you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| all have those. And talk about where we are and where, from their standpoint, where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=94)|
| 0:01:41| going. I'd like to ask Dr. Briggs to talk a little bit about what Commission had tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| to do at last month's meeting in terms of an alternate process. And then from that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| we'll just kind of take questions from there. Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie. And thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=114)|
| 0:02:02| every one of you for showing up. I'm really looking forward to this meeting tonight because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| I really look out into this audience and realize that people here are here to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| pros and cons and the arguments for and against and things like that as to what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| here as opposed to any kind of process that goes off on a negative kind of vein. So, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=137)|
| 0:02:26| got two documents that have been handed out to you. And what I'm going to do is use those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| documents to try to bring you totally up to date on how these amendments got posed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| what these amendments are. There are people, actually, in this audience that helped the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| process of developing Gloria Deathridge and Phyllis Nichols and A. Graham will be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| in just a little bit. I think a few more folks. But I'm sort of the one in the box to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| everybody up to date and to tell you what the amendments are. And then, once you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| what the amendments are and how they've gotten here, we really do look forward to any question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| that you have because our whole issue is to try to get these amendments on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| either in August or November, to try to make sure that people understand all the arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| for the amendments, all the arguments against the amendments, and that they're educated voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| We actually hope you vote for them. More importantly, we hope you vote and that you're educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| and that you're knowledgeable about the amendments when you do vote because they are important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| to the future of Knox County. Take the first document, which is the history and current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| timeline. This whole process, believe it or not, goes all the way back to 2000. Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| of you in this room, I know, were involved in a process called Nine Counties, One Vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| back in the year 2000, right at the turn of the century. And Nine Counties, One Vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| had 20 public meetings all over this region, the nine-county region, to try to ask people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| what their priorities were for the future. And out of that, over 7,000 people participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| Ultimately, there were 12 goals that came out of that process, and one of them related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| to government. And that governmental goal was stated as this, we want a region of citizen-driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| and responsible local governments which provide a wide range of coordinated and efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| services. Now, I can tell you that we had people involved in that whole process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| were passionate about this region, passionate about making it a better place, passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| about this community, and some of those folks were passionate about government issues. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| on January 12, 2007, to sort of fast forward to January of last year, when the Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| Court came out with their decision in the case Jordan v. Knox County, some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| people paid real attention to that decision. And the most surprising thing in that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| was not that term limits were upheld, because a lot of folks had believed that term limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| were legal before they were upheld. But what was surprising about it was the finding in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| the decision by the Supreme Court that because Knox County is one of only two counties in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| the state of Tennessee that has a home rule county government, that the citizens of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| County can change that government any way that they desire, any way that they desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| if the citizens approve, as it related to the executive branch of government and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| legislative branch of government. Now, that opened up possibilities that nobody ever dreamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| possible before. And so some of the folks who had been involved in Nine Counties, One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| Vision, organized a process that was modeled on that called Knox County, One Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| Ultimately, there were 56 people on the steering committee for Knox County, One Question. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| we wanted one question answered. We weren't giving the answer. We wanted one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| answered. What changes, if any, if we can make these changes, what changes, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| did the citizens want to make to the form or structure of government in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| There were five public meetings held around the county, northeast, southwest, and central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| We commissioned, we got the Seven Islands Foundation, which is a locally funded foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| funded by a guy by the name of Pete Claussen. Come on in, Abe. Pull a chair up if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| Abe's going to help me with this tonight. Abe Brown's a part of our steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=382)|
| 0:06:31| The Seven Islands Foundation funded the Howard Baker Center at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| the Howard Baker Center for Public Policy, to do research around the country of three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| things, really. One was what was existing conditions in government in Knox County. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| wasn't just focusing on Knox County government. It was focusing on the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| government, Knox County government, and the city of Farragut government. So what were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| the existing conditions? Number two, taking comparison counties outside the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=416)|
| 0:07:04| because there's only one other comparison county in the state of Tennessee that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| home rule government, and that's Memphis, which is far different than us. Taking similarly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| sized comparison counties outside the state of Tennessee, how does government in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| County compare to those counties? And so they chose 160 comparison counties outside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| state of Tennessee and compared us to those counties. And then the third piece of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| research was taking best practices in local government that had been recognized by national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| organizations around the country. Taking those best practices, compare them to existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| conditions in Knox County, Tennessee. And so the Baker Center did that research, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| you see at the bottom of page one there some of the findings, in fact the key findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| of that research, that structure does matter in local government. Now people matter. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| can have the best structure in the world and have terrible people, and you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| have terrible government. You can have great people and have a terrible structure, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| you're going to have pretty good government. But I think what they concluded was great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| people and a great structure is the best of all possible worlds. So structure does matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| in local government. They found that professionalism and accountability in local government is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| much more difficult in a long, valid environment. Now I won't ask for a show of hands, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| want you to answer this question yourself. Who in here can name the 55 elected positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| in Knox County government? If you can name the positions, which would be amazing, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| can name the people who are in them? I'll make it easier for you. Who can name the 27| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=529)|
| 0:08:59| elected positions in the, excuse me, 26 elected positions in the executive branch and legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| branch? If you can name those, name the people that are in them. Okay, I'm going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| it real easy for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Well, that's not really very fair because a lot of people don't know who their judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| are, and judges are elected. You don't know a judge unless you're born for divorce or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| it's a serious situation. So that's not really a fair answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| I'll make it easier for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Also, I just want to point out that while you can't really specifically name and or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| the positions, I can certainly say that if that particular elected official did something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=574)|
| 0:09:43| wrong, that we're going to know who they are and the ability to get in contact with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| All I'm guessing is this is what the Baker Center found, that in a long, valid environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| it is more difficult to hold folks accountable. But I will go forward just a second. In the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| executive branch, how many folks can name the seven executive branch officials with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| their positions, the people that are in them, and their jobs? Now, my point in this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| that that's right or wrong. It's that that was the kind of finding the Baker Center had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| They found that Knox County elects substantially more officials in its legislative and executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| branch than its peers. Knox County elects 26. The average of its 160 peers elected 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=622)|
| 0:10:30| They found that Knox County commission is substantially larger than its peers. Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| County elects 19. The average of its 160 was 9. They found that best practices in county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| commission structure include a mix of districts in that large representation and staggered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| terms. They found that Knox County had none of those attributes. They found that Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| County executive branch has seven different divisions with elected leaders, that the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| of its peers in the executive branch was one elected leader. And also, if you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| city of Knox, it elects one in the executive branch, a mayor. If you look at the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| of Tennessee, they elect one in the executive branch, a governor. If you look at the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| government, they elect one in the executive branch, a president. And I agree completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| with the gentleman here. If the president does wrong or any of his appointees does wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| we blame that president. We hold him accountable. If the governor does wrong or any of the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| branch of the state does wrong, we know who to hold accountable. If the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| mayor or any of the executive branch officials does wrong, we know who to hold accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| So that was the kind of finding that the Baker Center found. And then the last one on top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| page two, if you turn over, was the charter and ethical provisions to decrease favoritism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| to limit nepotism, and to limit conflicts of interest to make a difference in local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| government performance. We then had a six-public meeting to have reactions to the Baker Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| findings. And then the 56-person steering committee for Knox County, one question, went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| away on a retreat, full-day retreat. We took the Baker Center research, we took the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| input that we had gotten, and we came out with recommendations in a final report and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| recommendations that was published on September 9th, 2007. It is from those final recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| that these charter amendments were proposed. And on January 28th, we gave notice to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=743)|
| 0:12:33| Knox County Commission that we were prepared to go forward with a petition drive to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| those charter amendments on the ballot. You'll see, you'll see the way that we structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| the two petitions. Now we've been asked if we had eight or nine charter amendments. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| are now eight, by the way. There were nine at that time. One amendment has been dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| because it caused confusion for folks. It was called the consistency amendment. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| just one, frankly, the attorney said it'd be nice to have, but it didn't come out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| the process. And since it didn't come out of the process and it's not required to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| it, we have dropped it. So there's eight amendments. We've been asked why, if we go forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| a petition drive, we would only have two petitions and we would divide the number of amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| we go forward with between two petitions. And that, frankly, is just a matter of effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| time, and money. If you go forward, each petition is a yes or no vote, but each petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| has to get 40,000 signatures. And we just cannot possibly get eight times 40,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=812)|
| 0:13:40| The cost associated with that, the time associated with that, and frankly, for the Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| the cost associated with them having to count 40,000 times eight signatures. That's $35,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| per petition that would cost the Election Commission to count. County Commission then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| because they are in a position where they can put amendments on the ballot just if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| have two votes with a two-thirds majority on each vote. County Commission, and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| thankful to this, to tell you the truth, because we think this is a better way to go than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| petition drive. County Commission on February 27 voted for seven of the eight amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=859)|
| 0:14:30| to be on the ballot on first reading. Now remember I said on first reading. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| got to have two readings with a two-thirds vote. So that's where we are in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| right now. The second reading is, at this point, scheduled for the Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| last week in April. And so our hope is that County Commission will vote to put the seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| they've already voted on on first reading on the ballot. And we'd love them to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| the one that they did not have the requisite number of votes for. However, whatever they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| decide to put on the ballot themselves is one that we do not go forward on a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| drive. But our group is committed that whatever Commission does not put on, we will go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| on a petition drive that will start in June for putting it on the November ballot. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| again, our interest is very simple. We want people to understand these amendments. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| want them to have a chance to vote on them. We want them to be able to vote yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| and then we feel like we've done our job. I'll be glad to answer questions if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| to take questions now, but I really would like to go forward to explain the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| before we take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Well, in terms of, are you going to go through each amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Yeah, what I could do is just go through real quickly on each amendment and then summarize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Lawrence, can I ask one question? How many counties, you did 160?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| 160 comparison counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Were they the same size as Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| The Baton Baker Center tried to choose counties that were similarly situated, about the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| size, had similar characteristics. They actually set out in their report, which is online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| the full report is online at knoxcharterpetition.com. It's also on the Baker Center website. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| have that site, but you can look at the criteria that they used to choose the comparison counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| I'd like to take Mr. Antonio, I don't have a last name, so sorry to call you by your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| first name, and then Commissioner Davis's questions, and then we'll run through them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| if y'all don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| I just have a question, sir. You say that if this goes, you plan on putting this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| We would like to, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Now, is that with Commission's approval of it being put on the ballot, or no? Meaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| if it goes to a second reading where it doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| There are three ways to put a charter amendment on the ballot, and they're equal in legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| ways. One is through a citizen-driven charter petition drive, which we are prepared to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| The second way is Commission putting them on the ballot with a two-thirds vote on two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| readings. The third is through a charter review committee process that Commissioner Riggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| proposed, but did not receive the requisite number of votes at the last meeting. Any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| the three ways work, and so if Commission wants to put all of them on the ballot themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| that's great. If they don't, we still have the right to petition, and we plan to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| I just wanted to comment. In the Baker Center's findings, on page 57, with regard to the counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1062)|
| 0:17:53| the 160 counties that were compared to Knox County, it says in there that they did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| match up an elected mayor with an elected legislative body. When that occurred, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| average number of commissioners was 17. Thus, we only have two more than 17, which was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| norm. That's on page 57 of the Baker Center report. Also, Commissioner Larry Smith called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| around counties close to us. Nashville has 40 commissioners. Oak Ridge, Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| and Sevierville all have 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Here, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Just thought that you would like to have that information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| The amendments themselves are on the second handout that you got. The first amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1115)|
| 0:18:44| is establishing the number of signatures required for a citizen-driven charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| This one's really interesting. In the Knox County Charter right now, it says that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| number of signatures required for a citizen-driven charter amendment is 15% of the voters in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| the last gubernatorial election. Now, you would think that that charter provision would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| apply. It does not. There was a very little known amendment to state law, frankly related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| to something concerning Turkey Creek development. I don't understand it myself. But nobody in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| Knox County, or not many people in Knox County, knew that the amendment occurred. And it changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| the standard from 15% of voters in the last gubernatorial election to 15% of registered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| voters. And let me tell you what the practical impact of that is. 15% of voters in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| gubernatorial election, you need to get about 14,000 to 15,000 signatures on a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| 15% of registered voters, you need to get almost 40,000 signatures. We think the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| County Charter provision ought to be re-established. And the way the law works on this, according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| to the constitutional attorneys who researched it, is the last in time applies. And so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| there is a vote that indicates that citizens want the charter provision to apply, the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| would be amended to go back to the original standard. So that's the first one. The effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| date on that would be September 1, 2010. The second charter amendment is one of the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| controversial ones, the one that Commissioner Davis was just talking about. This change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| would result in every voter in Knox County electing three out of 11 commissioners, rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1225)|
| 0:20:34| than two out of 19. Right now, in this district, right now in this district, you vote for only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| two commissioners. You don't have any ability to vote for commissioners outside of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| district. So you vote for two out of 19. We believe that it would be better if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| had a smaller commission. We certainly have shorter meetings, by the way. A smaller commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| that could work together more effectively, that was more in line with the average of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| the peer counties, which was nine. And I will acknowledge, absolutely, that if you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| look at elected mayor, elected commission, the average was 17. But the average of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| whole 160 was nine. That the smaller commission...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| But they don't have the same type of government that we do, so you can't really compare that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| That's not an accurate comparison. They don't have the same type of government that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Also, when you get into the... What about the provision of the Constitution that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1285)|
| 0:21:34| elected representation proportion to population? See, that's my concern. Now, you can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| the at-large seats, but if you're going to propose reducing the size of the number of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| Because I believe that's in the state constitution. It's certainly in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| constitution, but I believe that Tennessee has a provision of you must have a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| amount of elected representatives per population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| And you would. You would still have... For example, right now you elect nine school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| members for Knox County. Those are proportional by population in the sense that the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| board districts are drawn to be proportional in population. The nine school board districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| you elect one school board member of those nine. You would still do this in this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| proposal. You would elect one of nine district representatives. You would also, though, elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| two at-large county-wide representatives, again, proportional by population. So it applies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| to... It does... It is applicable to the constitutional concern that you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| Let's go ahead and go through these, and then we'll open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| Right. All right. The third issue... And by the way, the other change there that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| significant, you need to understand this, is that the 11 would be elected by staggered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| terms right now. Everybody's elected at the same time. And particularly with term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| this is important. All 19 commissioners will be elected at the same time each time. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| you'd go to staggered terms. So part of the commissioners would be elected every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| The other thing you would go to is, right now, the commission districts and the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| board districts, even though you say, I vote in District 1, those are two different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| It's incredibly confusing. Incredibly confusing. So if you vote in District 1 for school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| it would be the same geographic boundaries as District 1 for commission. So these changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| would all occur under that particular ordinance or charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| The third is conflict of interest on an administrative matter. In the public meetings that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| the most often cited complaints were nepotism, conflicts of interest, patronage, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| And so this is one of the ethical changes that we suggest. That is, that on administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| matters, and a good example of an administrative matter is somebody making decisions on grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1449)|
| 0:24:17| If you had a conflict of interest on something you were making a decision on, you could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| make a decision on that particular matter. You would have to disclose it with a form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| that was provided by the law department and recuse yourself, which means remove yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| from any consideration of that particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Over to the next page, the fourth charter proposal is the establishment of an independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| office of inspector general. Presently, there is an office of internal audit for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1482)|
| 0:24:51| And all we're suggesting is beefing that up to where it becomes a true independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| office of inspector general. This is intended to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| departments of county government, to do management audits, reviews, and researches of all branches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| of the government, and to refer any issues of fraud to the attorney general's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1510)|
| 0:25:21| but otherwise to do the audits and make sure that the dollars are recovered in the instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| of any kind of mismanagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| What makes it independent is this. It would be a specific term, six years. It could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| reappointed. It would have a fixed salary, so that salary couldn't be messed with. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| would be selected through a process that includes both the executive branch and the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| branch of government with the ethics committee that is a mixture of both in the middle, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| that is that the request for qualifications to start off the process where someone would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| apply for this position would be issued by the purchasing department, which is part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| the executive branch. The review of qualifications would be done by the ethics committee, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| is jointly appointed by the executive branch and the legislative branch, and then the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| appointment would be done by the legislative branch. The effective date of this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| amendment would be September 1, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| The next amendment is restrictions on nepotism. Again, this is one of the biggest complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| that we heard at the public meetings, and this is that no elected or appointed official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| can do anything at all to help the employment of any relative in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| Now, relative is defined already in the Knox County Ethics Code as relative to the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| degree, which would be a son or a daughter or a parent, or relative to the second degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| which would be a grandparent, grandson, aunt, uncle, nephew, or niece. This one would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| effect right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| The next one on the next page is that county commissioners cannot be employed by other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| branches of Knox County government. This does not keep somebody who is presently employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| by Knox County from running for office. However, if they are elected, they would have to choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| if they're going to serve in that elected office, they couldn't have their employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| with the other branch of county government. And the reason for this is there is no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| you can remove that conflict of interest. That's an everyday conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| The next one, number seven, is conflict of interest on a voted matter. Right now, county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| commissioners, if they have a conflict of interest, say that they have a financial interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| in a development, they are required to disclose that conflict of interest on the record. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| has been a change that has been adopted already. And that's good. What this does is go further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1661)|
| 0:27:49| which is you couldn't be a part of the discussion on that matter, and you couldn't vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| matter. That is not the present case. Those are the seven that so far commission has voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| on first reading, at least, to put on the ballot. That doesn't mean they would vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| for them on second reading. And as you can hear from commissioners in this forum, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| got questions about several of them. There are two, though, that weren't voted on on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| first reading. They actually passed, but they didn't get the two-thirds majority. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| they got 10 or 11 votes instead of 13 or 14. And that first one at the bottom of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| page is the consistency amendment. That's the one we dropped, so just forget about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| That just stayed in existing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Can you explain that, Mr. Tulloch, the reasoning for dropping that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Yeah, very much so. The consistency amendment, frankly, was added by our attorneys saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1720)|
| 0:28:48| that a good charter would have this provision in it. However, all it does is state existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| law. It doesn't change the law. If it wasn't there, this would still be the law. And it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| seemed to be, for some reason, that as simple as this one was, and there was no intent behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| it at all to change anything, it confused people. And people thought there was a conspiracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| somehow to do something bad with this one. If it confuses one person, it's not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| So the coordinating committee for Knox Charter Petition decided to drop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| Can I comment on that? I voted against the consistency amendment. I wasn't confused by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| Numerous people from your group said that commissioners that voted against it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| didn't understand what we were voting for or against. But I'd like to explain why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| voted against it. And that was because of the language in the ordinance where it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| effectively eliminate charter language. And in one of the ordinances that you have with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1788)|
| 0:29:58| regard to the fee offices being appointed, in that ordinance, in that language, it did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1798)|
| 0:30:07| not have job duties and descriptions. Well, back in 2006, Judge Chancellor Weber said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| our charter was invalid because we did not include those things. We had a charter review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| committee include those things. And so, therefore, the consistency amendment, if it had gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| through, and those amendments with regard to appointments would have thereby made our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| charter invalid once again, and we would have had to start that whole process once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| So that was my rationale for why I voted against the consistency amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| And again, if it confused in any way those kinds of issues, it was just not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| So that's the reason we dropped it. The very last page...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| Can I ask one more question before we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Well, let's... real quick, real quick. Go ahead. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| My question is, in numerous forums, in numerous places, attorneys, and you have even said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| that you've given us opinions that attorneys have vetted these. And now you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| that you're dropping this because there's already current state law that has this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| it's already in our charter as well. So my question...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| It's not this exact language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| It's pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| There was just one aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| The severability was caused, was not included in your amendment, but is in our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| and that's the difference. But my question to you, sir, is if you do have attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| thoroughly vetting these, why is it that this amendment, as well as other discrepancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| were overlooked? Because this is the big thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| First of all...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| If an attorney says it's needed and it's necessary, and then it's in the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| and it's also already in our charter, did anyone read the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Did they marry those things up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| All I can tell you is the attorneys that we've used, Commissioner Davis, were the same folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| who won the term limits case in Jordan versus Knox County, and we think they're the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| constitutional attorneys in this particular area. We stand by this consistency amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| I mean, there's nothing wrong with it at all. However, it is not necessary because it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| state existing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| But it duplicates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| So the bottom line is if it confuses anybody at all, if it confuses anybody at all, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| it doesn't make a policy change, why include it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| So we don't think there's any concern at all that we've got with any of the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| However, we also have heard commissioners who believe that wording here or the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| structure amendments, things like that, would be a better way to put them before the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| We love those ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Anybody who has an idea of how to improve them, we want to see them improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| However, whether the substance is legal or not, we'll be glad to let our attorneys speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| on that because they're the ones who made the law in Jordan versus Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| Now, the last particular ordinance is the most controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| It is absolutely the most controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Probably the most fun to talk about, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| And that's what I really want to leave everybody with as my section ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| This is not about winning or losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| This is about real, live choices for the future of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| That's why we think it's so important these amendments be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| These are legitimate things to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| These are legitimate issues to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| And this particular amendment, if anything else, points that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| It is an amendment to restructure the executive branch of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| It would be a major change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| The one thing that the Jordan versus Knox County case pointed out more than anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| is we are not bound by the way they structured government in the 1790s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| when people were riding on horseback and keeping records in their knapsacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| That's why these positions were elected at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| They had to be trusted people to keep up with records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| The restructuring of the executive branch says this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| that as it relates to the historic fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| the trustee, the registrar of deeds, and the county clerk that have been around for 215 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2067)|
| 0:34:37| that those are purely administrative functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| And just because we always elected them doesn't mean we should continue to elect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| They do not make policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| It's like electing a dog catcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| They do not make policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| And the bottom line is that the right way to hold folks accountable in that instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| is for a mayor, not this mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Now, make sure you understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| The tax effect September 1, 2010, after the current mayor is term limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| this is about any future mayor, not this mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| that a mayor should appoint department directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| to include the trustee, the clerk, and the registrar of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| as well as the law director, those four positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| They should appoint that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Commission also would be given additional powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| We know we're requesting that a mayor be given additional powers to appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| but commission is given additional powers to approve by a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| More importantly, should there be misconduct by any department director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| not just these four, but by existing department directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| commission is given a power to remove a department director from misconduct with a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| So it's a basic American civics balance of power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| between an executive branch and a legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| And the comparison is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| The city of Knoxville elects a mayor, one person in the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| He appoints the department directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| The state of Tennessee elects one governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| appoints the department directors approved by the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| The president, executive branch, federal government appoints the department directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| or the cabinet members approved by Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| It's a check and balance American civics concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| We think that's a fair thing to put before the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| We know that it will downsize the size of and the cost of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| We know that $8.9 million, $8.9 million every single year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| will become a part of the budget priorities decided on by commission every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| and that $8.9 million in fees right now is totally outside the budget-setting priorities of this county every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2221)|
| 0:37:09| I'd rather see those dollars be going to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Now, that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| But whether or not you have a different opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| because the corresponding argument on this is you're taking away our vote on certain positions, four positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| I would just argue with you that on commission, we're actually adding a vote for an additional position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| two at large and one commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| In this one, we are suggesting that four votes be taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| We think it makes for a more streamlined and accountable executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| That's why this one, if it was put before the voters tomorrow, could easily not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| No question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| But it's game for a fair, educational discussion in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| as to what you want for the future of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| So those are the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Now, I'd like to ask Commissioner Briggs if he'd just kind of bring the people up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| about what his proposal was and where we are within the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| Where we stand right now is that in the February meeting, we passed seven of the original nine amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2289)|
| 0:38:17| We've gone over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| The two that did not pass in February on the first reading, and those passed by two-thirds majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| one of those has been dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| That's the consistency amendment that we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| And the other one that failed is this very last one where you have restructuring of the executive branch of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| That's the one where the mayor appoints the fee offices and the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| And that's where we stood at the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| In March, at the Intergovernmental Committee meeting and the Finance Committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| I proposed that we have a Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| And what our charter says about that is that the mayor can appoint a Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| to review the charter or to review amendments and make any suggestions or actually approve amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| Part of the problem with that is it's not an ideal situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| It's that those amendments go directly to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| They do not go directly to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| They go to the ballot to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| And one of the things that I want to emphasize, and I think there was some confusion at some of our previous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| is that none of these amendments, none of the proposed amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| become part of the charter unless they're voted on by the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| By none of the three methods that Mr. Tully talked about, none of those go on the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| All of them, they only can go on the charter by being voted in by the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| But with the Charter Review Committee, the mayor appoints one of the commissioners from each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| so there will be nine commissioners on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| and then he has to appoint a minimum of ten citizens with one of those from each district also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| So with the Charter Review Committee, there's always more citizens than there are commissioners on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2402)|
| 0:40:11| Now, the mayor appointed a total of 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| There were nine commissioners and 18 citizens that were appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| Now, what the charter also says is that after the mayor appoints that Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| it comes back to the county commission to approve or disapprove in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| They can't go through and say, I like this one, I don't like this one, I like this one, I don't like this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| They either have to approve or disapprove of all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And at the meeting that we had in March, on March 24th, it was not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| It lacked passing by one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| I think we can get different reasons why people didn't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Part of it is that they wanted those amendments to come back to the commission to be reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| but that wasn't permitted by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Some of the people had questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| We didn't have the biographies available on some of the citizens that had been appointed to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| We really didn't know who they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| And then there were a host of other issues that maybe because there were so many more citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| and there were elected representatives that that really wouldn't be a reflection of the voice of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| who weren't maybe represented by some of their elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| There were different reasons, but it failed by one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Let me state the reason why I really wanted to have a Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| It wasn't necessarily to endorse or not endorse a particular amendment on its merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| but I wanted to have a Charter Review Committee because I was concerned about some of the language that I thought we could make better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| I think the most important thing that we can do when I'm talking about those of us on the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2504)|
| 0:41:51| the most important thing that we can do is to send a clear, concise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| and very well-worded amendment for the voters to vote on on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| And there is some language in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| I know some of the other amendments, I mean, if you've gone to vote and you've read these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| they're 300-word sentences, they're very confusing, you're not really sure what you're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| and I didn't want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Also, if an amendment was passed and did become part of our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| I wanted to be absolutely certain that there weren't any legal ambiguities that could end up in a whole series of lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| And we can talk about some of those ambiguities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| But to any extent, the Charter Review Committee failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| And so we're back now to really two choices about putting these amendments on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| One is that they can pass with the second reading, which will take place in the April commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| and seven of the eight that were proposed now will be read and we'll vote on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| But there's still some wording problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Some of those have even been changed by the charter petition group, and they don't even agree with the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| And then the other way that it can be done is through the petition process that Mr. Tulloch told you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| where you have to have 40,000 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| One of the 40,000 voters signed the petition, and there could be two petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| One of the concerns I had also is that I called the director of the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| and he says it cost about a dollar, cost the taxpayers about a dollar a signature for them to confirm that it is a registered voter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2597)|
| 0:43:26| and they live in the district where they say they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| So if they had two amendments, we're talking about roughly $70,000 to $80,000 to approve those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| So if possible, I would really not like to go that route unless we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| One of the things, you know, we're not allowed to talk about this under the Sunshine Law amongst ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| and one of the things that I'm even proposing, we have our chairman here right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| that we can still have the opportunity to correct some of the wordings and these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| before we review them the night of the next commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| is that maybe he could appoint an ad hoc committee of several of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| We could have some citizens' involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| We can just sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| We're not going to debate the merits of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| but what we are going to do is just try to clean up some of the wording so there's no unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| And it also could save a lot of time because if we have to go through each one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| debate all of these the night of the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| I'm not sure we'll get that all finished by 2 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| But have it something where we can have a cleaner amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| There are several changes that have already been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| and have already been made by the Charter Review Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| but those changes are not on the amendments that we voted for on the February meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2678)|
| 0:44:47| and they will not be the ones that we vote for in April unless we make the changes ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| and know what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| And that's one of the things that I think that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| what I like our chairman and some of the other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| we've got Commissioner Davis, if you don't know who she is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| she's from the 4th District that came in just a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| But I think that's something that we might think about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| We've got Commissioner Rountree here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| And really the purpose is just to try to get the wording better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| We're not trying to pass judgment on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| we're not trying to change the pros or cons or the merits of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| We just look at these and see if we can make the wording better, more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| There's one word that I had some problems with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| on whether an employee of the county can sit on the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| and they define that as someone who receives direct compensation or indirect compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| And I think that word indirect compensation is very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| And I think they've recommended that they drop that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| but the way it stands now, we're still going to be voting on the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| And I would just like to get that cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| I'll stop right now and turn it back over to our moderator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| but that is one of the proposals that I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| is having an ad hoc committee just to try to clean up the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| to save some time the night of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| rather than arguing over each little word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| is saying, look, this is what we propose doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| So unless Commissioner Strickland has anything to add now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| I want to open it up for any and all questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| If you can direct your question to a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| or a member of the petition group in particular or in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| Antonio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| The problem I have, and I have a big problem with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| because you talk about the language of the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Now, you want to talk about lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| I do know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| If I put something on a petition and you're sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| talking about changing the wording of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| you're going to have a lawsuit on your hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| because I'm going to bring one myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| I want to have guarantees that what I put on a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| and what goes on the ballot is the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| and who actually makes sure that it stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| Is it the county law director or who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Because I'm getting nervous about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| you're talking about a word here or a word there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| or making sure that the language fits, you know, how you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| I understand the Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| I'm not talking about necessarily changing the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| That would be up to them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| What I'm talking about as an elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| is I think it's our duty and responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| to be certain that what the voters vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| is clear, concise, and unambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| Well, I understand the Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Now, let me just make one other point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| is that the things that we vote on on our second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| you know, we can make amendments to change those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| or we can change some of the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Now, once that passes, that's what goes on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| and it will not be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Now, what they put on the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| we don't have as elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| we don't have any control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Now, I understand the Tennessee State Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| it has to be 300 words or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| but while you're making that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| while you're making that amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| and you decide to change some words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| are there any guarantees that it's not going to be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| than what was proposed in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Are there any guarantees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Probably not, but the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| But the intent, there are some confusing words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| as it's written right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| One in particular is one that Commissioner Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| what does indirectly working for the county mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| So, this ad hoc committee, and I actually like that idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| we would just go and vet it for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Not to change the intent now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| but there might be an unintentional consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| And so what I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| that would probably lean me toward getting the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| to come out with the verbiage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| making that verbiage public prior to the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Because what's going to happen at the April commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| we're going to change those words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| and no one will have an opportunity to say anything on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| unless they're there to speak in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| I'm not talking about changing the actual petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Tell me, let me respond to the change in the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Right now, we have withdrawn all petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| And you're pointing out a terrific, terrific point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| We have withdrawn all petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| because we can hold off until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| Let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| This whole area of the law related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| when you can put a petition on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| is confusing to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| There are actually state laws that are in conflict with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| And so we got an attorney general's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| and just received it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| that confirms what the law director's opinion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| confirms what the state election commission attorney's opinion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| and confirms what our attorney's opinion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| that we can petition to be on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Now, what that does effectively is it takes the pressure off time-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| If we could only have been on the August ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| which was with the confusion in the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| we felt like we needed to go for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| If we could only have been on the August ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| we already would have started a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| If it was on the November ballot, it would have made the August ballot null and void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Yeah, but here's the bottom line of the practical effect of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| is we don't need to start a petition drive until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| So that gives us all of April, all of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| to make sure that anybody who's got a concern about any single word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| that is confusing, that that concern is cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| My intent is exactly what yours is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| You can't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| There's two ways you can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Anything that commission decides to put on the ballot that relates to a confusing word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| our commitment is to work with them on clearing up that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| before there's a vote on second reading that would finalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| Secondly, even if commission does not put these on the ballot themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| any word that we've heard that confuses somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| we'll correct ourselves before we start a petition drive in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| I'll let somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| I'm going to get back to John and then Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| First of all, thank you all for coming out to the first district tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| And, Dr. Briggs, I am a fan of clear, concise, and complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| where yes could actually mean yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| rather than some convoluted language that we've all seen on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| One thing in particular in regards to reducing the size of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| and I would like to direct this to my commissioners, McKenzie and Strickland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| my impression, based strictly on what I've read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| my limited understanding that that would serve the first district court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| Do you have any thoughts about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| I definitely have some thoughts about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| That you could share with us tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Well, I voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| And the reason I voted against it is because there is a Vote of the Right Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| and when you start diminishing minority participation on an elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| and I think I've addressed this to the committee, one question of what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| We've been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Well, that's what I was going to use, those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| But if my memory serves me right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| when they changed a lot of different governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| they had to go to the Justice Department for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| and that's something that they did not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| And that's very viable today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| The Justice Department has an interest in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| and they have turned some municipalities down on some of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| because of that ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| And my primary reason for voting it down is what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| I think it does the 1st District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| and districts like the 1st District a disservice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| In terms of, to be brutally honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| I mean, you know, I think Farragut would vote well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| and I think we have potentially three commissioners from Deep West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| and one from the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| And that may or may not happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| but I think I actually like the way, being a newly appointed commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| I do wish I could communicate with my counterpart in the 1st District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| but I think having two per district actually serves us well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| I think it allows us to be more accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| It gives the people more power in terms of having accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| to their elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| Now, let me suggest something, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| That points out exactly the kind of pros and cons, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| that you want to debate on these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| There are reasons to vote against these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| There's reasons to vote for these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| But let me point out one that may not be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| Or two, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| One is that if you're in the 1st District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| now your two commissioners have to convince eight commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| from outside this district to support something for the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| If you have 11 commissioners, two elected at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| one from the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| you have to convince three over the ones that you vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| In other words, you have a vote over your district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| You also have a vote over the two at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| That's three of a majority of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| I would argue, if I was in the 1st District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| I actually have the ability to get things done more effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| in that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Now, secondly, as to the argument that all of the countywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| at large representatives are going to come from out west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| let's look at what the history has been in county elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| Last county executive, I believe, was elected from North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| The county executive before that was elected from South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| The trustee, the clerk, and other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| have been elected from non-West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| I think good candidates running from any place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| can win countywide if they're great candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| I think in the 21st century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| where we're seeing Barack Obama do so well on a national basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| that an argument that we only have the ability to get people elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| from one part of town, I think, is inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| But it's about money, Mr. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| and about having money to fund a campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| I am not anti-West Knoxville at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| It's just not about West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| But I am very pro-1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| I am very pro-1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| But also, wait a minute, I've got to say something on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| But, you know, they are elected in the 1st District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| and I hope they are thinking like I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| wanting to be elected in the 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| that they are for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| And that they will look towards my district favorably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| without me having to convince them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| because they might have business in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| and have counterparts from their district and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| And we all have to work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| and I pray to God that when someone is elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| they aren't just going to sit in their district and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| I am not going anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Because when I'm elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| I will be elected for my district plus all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| And I hope that in the future, when everyone else is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| that that's how they're going to be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| So, Lawrence, I'm sorry, but I disagree with your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| Okay, let me go to Thera's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| and then we'll get back to Atoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| I'm sorry, did you have yours up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Yeah, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| I'm sorry, Thera Niasse and then Atoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| Thera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| My question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| You had stated that on March the 24th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| that you voted down the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| So I understand that that committee is disbanded now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| It hasn't been disbanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| It never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| It never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| You only had the nomination for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Gosh, they look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| I did, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| So now you're recommending that you have an ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| This is the first time anybody's heard about this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| It has not been proposed to County Commission yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| I think there's something that our chair has the power to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| He has the power to assemble an ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| So I think that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| A call meeting to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Am I understanding that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| I can't call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| I can't have a call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Then when is the ad hoc committee going to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| What he's suggesting is that I just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| Just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| And there's other proposals that we can wait since there's no rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| If it's going to be on the November ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| we can discuss it in the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Who all would be on this ad hoc committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| How would it be formed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Would it just be whoever Tank picked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| What's the suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| I think if what we did was to pick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| I don't care how many people are on it because it's not something that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| trying to put any merit on these things or to try to judge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| It's just we can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| So when we have our meeting in April, I can say, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| I think you all dropped the nonpartisan on the election of the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| We're willing to drop that if that's what commissioners want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| We've already voted for it to be a nonpartisan election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Sorry, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| For the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| And what we would do is if we sit down and they've already dropped that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| is that I would say or somebody could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| I'd like to make a motion as an amendment to this is that we drop the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| The important part about this is we've agreed because of commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| objections and some public objections to drop certain things that weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| really necessary for the spirit of what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| working out the wording of how that has dropped is exactly what needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| done with this committee if the committee is appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| That doesn't mean it's going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| We said, look, we've looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| We've had the law director there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| We've had there's attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| we've had citizens that want to participate if they have some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| but we're all really we're trying to do is to save time the night of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| meeting and take out things that everybody agrees that are at least the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| people that are there agree should be taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| It still has to be voted on by the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| If they decide they don't want to take that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| then it's not taken out and we leave those things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| But I think that there's I think there's enough items that we would look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| this and say this could potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| The other one that we have is that on appointing the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| is that a law director that's that see his election is off cycle with the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| He'll be two terms into an elected four year term when that law takes effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| or that amendment takes effect on September the 1st, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| I could see a lawsuit where the law director that was elected said I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| elected to a four year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| And I'm not real good with these legal terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| but there's a thing called ex post facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| It means you can't pass a law after somebody's already done something and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| take it away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| And see what I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| this is we'd have to talk it out and I'm not discussing this with anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| but I would propose it for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| We move that forward until September the 1st, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| And that way you don't get involved in a lawsuit if a man halfway through his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| term says I have the right to finish my term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| See that's the kind of things I'm talking about changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| My only other question to this is as the chair with this ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3688)|
| 1:01:37| would you be the one that would choose the members of the ad hoc committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| I mean you can do it a whole lot of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| This is the first I heard of it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| That might be a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| I apologize to our chairman and everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| We cannot talk to each other about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| and so I had to wait until tonight to be able to say it because we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| I understand, and that's why I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| I'm sorry, and I don't mean to put him on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| this is the thing he may need to study, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Can I add a comment there in response to what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| I voted against the Charter Review Committee the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| and this is one of the very reasons I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| was because on that there was nine commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| and out of the nine, five of them were newly appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| We've been appointed since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| We don't have institutional knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| We're not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| We're sitting here questioning what we can and can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| and we're wanting to totally completely restructure our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| and we're not even sure how to form a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| That doesn't give me confidence in really in what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| this process may be, these amendments may be the greatest thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| but we need to slow down and seriously talk about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| and look at them and wait until maybe 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| I don't think that they need to be put on this August or this November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| I think that that's rushing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| and it doesn't give the citizens an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| to really fully understand what we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| because the new Sentinel has not reported in the fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| That was my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| that even if you were knowledgeable about the ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| I mean, what kind of people would you be looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| to sit down and address the language in the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| that could even make a recommendation for a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| Yeah, those are all good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| My second thing is I don't like talking to people that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| This is Abe Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| He is a member of the Knox County Petition Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| I think he had a part to present, but I think Lawrence was on the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| I think I was on the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| So he's part of the Knox County Petition Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Let me make one real quick comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| and I really agree with what Commissioner Davis says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| That was part of the reason I wanted to have this Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| is that that slowed the process down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| and that was one of the points that I made all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| We need to slow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| No, Mr. Briggs, but Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| those would have been on the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| That wouldn't have slowed anything there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Let me finish, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| Part of the problem is that we have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| I'm taking the people from the Charter Petition Group serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| when they say if we don't do it, they're going to do it on petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| Then that way, the elected officials lose all control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| We have no control over the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| We have no input in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| The amendments will be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| I don't think they want to do that either, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| I think they would much rather have everyone's input into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| But if we don't take charge and we don't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| and we're working with them to try to get this wording right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| they're going to go ahead and do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| We just risk putting amendments that aren't debated, aren't discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| aren't vetted, haven't gone by the county law director on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| with maybe it'll be clear, concise language, maybe it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| Maybe there'll be ambiguities, maybe it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| We have no control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| Let me say a couple things, and then I'll get to your question, Mr. Ding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| Commissioner Briggs brought out a couple of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| that the Charter Review Petition Organization will concede on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| I think is not too strong of a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| That's the one piece they actually gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| They sent us a press release on March 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| and that was the nonpartisan piece of Ordinance 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| And they also agreed to reconsider the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3936)|
| 1:05:44| and commission districts being unified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| Those were the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| I don't know if there's any other ones that you want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| There has not been, not since that press release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| we have not had any additional, I guess I should say, reconsiderations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| Those were expressly expressed to us through the commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| and those are items that, as Mr. Talich already said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| those are items that don't necessarily affect the spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| and affect the substance of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| but it is some language that can possibly be adjusted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| can possibly be reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| I thought the property assessor was taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| Everything that's in that press release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| And it all comes out of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| I don't have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=3999)|
| 1:06:47| So let me move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| One, as a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| we have to agree that the charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| or the charter review process of having certain items removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4026)|
| 1:07:12| from the charter by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| if those items are removed by the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| and approved by Mr. Talich and the committee, the steering committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| then we won't see a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| Well, I guess you will see a two-thirds vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| in terms of the commission approving the charter as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| and then it goes to the ballot for approval by the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Is that right or wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Am I understanding that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| If the commission approves...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| I would have to strongly disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| with not downsizing the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| and let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| There are about four districts inside the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| that have county commissioners in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| that have absolutely no representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| no authority to do anything inside the city itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| but lend their vote to a true county commissioner for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| i.e., Lumpy Lambert is a prime example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| He can solicit a vote from the first district commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| to approve some type of development or funding for his district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| but when it comes to the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| the funding or the approval for the development in the first district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| is limited to the commission because they don't have that ability to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| I think having nine commissioners instead of the 18 that we have on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4126)|
| 1:08:56| it would lend the process to having reviews by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4136)|
| 1:09:04| or solicitation from the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| to come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| hey, we want to be able to set up development in the first district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| in order to say we want to lend money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| we want to do construction, whatever the case may be, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| I think having nine people on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| and stop trying to solicit six or seven votes for a particular area for growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| I think would be better for the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| I think if you downsize, you get more productivity in this particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| here than to be infighting with trying to lend a vote to whatever district throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| The third thing, if you don't mind, I want to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| I'm not commenting on the productivity piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| but nothing would change as far as if a developer wanted to do something in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| it still would not come before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Well, that is true to a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| I'm going to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| But in terms of being able to effectively create some economic stimuli in this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4208)|
| 1:10:17| the county can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| I think it would be easier with nine than it would be with the full commission body that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| I think if you downsize that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| that each commissioner doesn't struggle to gain the vote of four or five who may not be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4229)|
| 1:10:38| Because I think the way it is now, it's just a swapping process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| And the first district right here could do a lot better in terms of economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| if it had a smaller commission on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| That's just my opinion on it by looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| You've got certain district commissioners that sit from the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4254)|
| 1:11:02| but from the paper mill district on down to the West Hills exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4262)|
| 1:11:09| That has a county commissioner in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| But when you look at the district itself, it has growth to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| When you look at this same district that has the same geographical makeup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| it's an inner city district with a commissioner in it, there's no growth over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| And I think if you downsize the commission, the infighting and the politics of it somewhat goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| I mean, that's how I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| The third thing that I would ask Mr. Tulloch is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| is it a consideration, since there is concern about the loss of authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| from the commissioners in this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| is there a consideration to go to the legislative body of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| to have the district redrawn to make sure that there is enough empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| in this district to where that particular vote is not taken away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| There is provision in that particular amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| that when the district is redrawn every ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| that it would be aligned with the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| The power to redraw the district sits with county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| And so I don't think you'd have to go to the state to get it redrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| in a way that deals with what you're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| I think you'd have to go to county commission and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| this would be an opportunity in 2010 to redraw these districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| in a way that gets more minority participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Wouldn't that be a consideration for county commission then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| to take under its wing to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| so that that concern is addressed within this petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| If I'm sitting on county commission at that point, I would definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| Is it Magnolia in the first district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| There are several things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| He's talking about not having, you're getting that huge, wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| We don't have it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| There's no funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| There's no funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| There's no nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| I've got a few concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| First of all, getting back to appointing clerk, trustee, register of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4406)|
| 1:13:35| property assessor, because you say that there's no conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| there's accountability, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| But my question is, when the mayor, if this is what you're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4424)|
| 1:13:52| the mayor appoint all of these, I kind of have concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| especially in regards to property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| That is actually one of the points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| one of the pieces of language that is up for reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| in the press relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| Could you be kind of, which should he appoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| While he's finding it, I want to tell you that this has actually been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| I won't say it's the most pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| I won't say it's the most pleasant process I've ever been through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| Let me make myself clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| And this is to all the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| If you're concerned about, as far as the representation and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| call me crazy, but why not a metro government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| It's been voted down three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| It's been voted down three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| But my question to that, why it's been voted down three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| is how is it put on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Because if you want to take two commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| and you want to take one away and then have, you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| two at large, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Why not make it four or five at large based on geographical location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| So you have north, south, east, west, and central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| or just north, south, east, and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Therefore, each district has two representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| based on geographical location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| depending on what part of the city you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| And you can't say that west has five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| representation of five county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| and east has only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| You break it down by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| and you guys can come up with whatever geographical strategy you want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| I'm just being very basic, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| by north, south, east, west, and central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| so that you reduce it from 19 to 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| I think that's not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| Yes, 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| There's so many people that out west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| is that they would be greatly unrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| But that's how the voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| that's how it's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| If there are more people that live out west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| then they should have more elected representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| That's the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| There are three commissioners in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| That's just the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| And I'm saying, leave it alone, is what I'm saying personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| I'm saying it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| It may not have worked over the last year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| but that process, I think, is representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| I think population standards should have more representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| than those that are more sparsely populated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| But I wanted to ask Abe to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Let me read the piece of the release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| talking about the property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| just so you know what's been suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| Regarding executive branch streamlining amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| we have been persuaded by the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| that changing the property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| from elected to appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| should be removed from the executive branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| streamlining amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Unlike the frontier era fee offices and the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| which are totally administrative positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| the property assessor acts more like a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| by presiding over the board of equalization process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| But so does the law director, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| No, the law director is an advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| Merely an advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| I want to respond to Antonio's point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| Very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| And Abe has dealt with the property assessor issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| The second one is why not Metro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| There are a couple reasons why that's not proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| The first is that in the public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| there was a lot of people who argued for Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| There were just as many who argued against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| There certainly wasn't any kind of unanimity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| The second reason is because the Baker Center research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| indicated that in America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| there's only 33 out of 3,000 counties in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| that have successfully voted in Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| When I was in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| When I was in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| And since Nashville voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| there's been three attempts in Knoxville that have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| Now, my point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| We decided when we had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| Knox County One Question steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| that if we had consensus among the entire steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| on a proposal to go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| we would go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| If we didn't have consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| we would not go forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| We did not have consensus on Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| so we did not go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| And one of the reasons we did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| is there was a belief that in the current environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| since you have to have a vote inside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| and also in the county for Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| that in the current environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| in the sort of problems that Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| has had over the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| you would not have a positive vote inside the city for Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| You might not have a positive vote outside the city either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| But we didn't think in the current environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| that you would have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| So we believe that at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| the opportunity presented by the Supreme Court in Jordan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| argued for modernizing Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| as a good in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| If that eventually helps to consolidate functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| that are overlapping between the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| that's a second good step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| That's not where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Then try nine by district and then nine at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| because you already have an overlapping in the form of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| I mean, taxation with representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| isn't working out so well either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| So, I mean, we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| I mean, I think Commissioner Strickland said it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| The people voted on three separate occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| and just the majority of people are not in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| I guess as of, how many years ago was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Was the last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| So that's kind of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| I mean, but if a group like Knox County petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| wants to start that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| we can have that dialogue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Commissioner Davis and then Mr. Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Yeah, I wanted to make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| with regard to the offices being appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| In the ordinance, it states that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| Mr. Tulloch explained earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| that commission can remove them by two-thirds of a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| But it also states that the mayor can dismiss them without cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| And a real concern of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| is that the county trustee is in charge of our banking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| So the mayor can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Trustee, I want you to bank with Bank A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| And if the trustee says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| no, I spread it around all over the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| which is what they currently do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| the mayor can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| well, you're dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| Well, let's talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| The banking relationship for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| would be approved then by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| not by the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| Right now the commission has no control over that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| There is no check and balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Secondly, everybody in this room is a city voter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| except maybe one or two folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| The chief financial officer for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| has the power that you're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| It's an appointed official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| It is working very, very effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| because the check and balance is city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| approving the banks in which the investments are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| This is about checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| This is not about giving the mayor a power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| that doesn't give the commission a corresponding power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| for a check and balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Ms. Yen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| just to go through the ones that I would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| Number one, the 15% of voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| Voters in the last gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| That really, that was what, put in what, 98, 99?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| I was working on the living wage thing at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| and we were thinking about doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| We had the old 15% and we found out we couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| And it was a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| I would not vote for 102 as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| I don't agree with stagnant terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| I think a long ballot, actually, as we saw in this election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| the more candidates on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| the more people come out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| And also, I wouldn't vote for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| with respect to the chairman's, what he said concerning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| That's the bottom line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| With respect to 105,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| I would consider voting for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| but since you dropped the property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| I may not consider voting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| I think they should all be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| I think property assessor is not that old of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| It's what, like the 78?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| Was it 78 when it was put in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Something of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| 78 constitutional changes when we put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| the county commission we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| I don't see any reason to have to have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| but that's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| The other thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| I think that the petition people need to get down to one sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| if they're going to convince anybody to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Because if you ask the three gentlemen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| that's been elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| I guarantee you, on the polls, they give out one sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| It's not just this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| The other thing I want to ask you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| can you divide these petitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| I've heard both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| The last I heard, you may have heard something new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| the last I heard that you cannot have two separate petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| In this manner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| That's been approved by the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Let me go back and sort of tell you the history on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| The simple answer is, yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| The reason we know we can is that on September 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| when the Knox County One Question recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| were publicly released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| at that time, the initial cut on the charter language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| was also released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| We started working behind the scenes at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| after a month or so of no action on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| we started working behind the scenes at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| with the State Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| on what the form of a petition would have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| And we honestly wanted the petition to be one petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| with separate questions that would be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| That's exactly how we wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| The Election Commission attorney ruled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| that each petition is a separate yes or no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| We knew we didn't have the capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| of doing eight separate petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| And so that's when we divided them into two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| So when we went public with that in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| we informed the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| that this is the way the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| that this is the way we would have to go forward with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| unless commission voted for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| the way that they can put them on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| as separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| And so that's why we hope they will put as many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| as they are comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| So Brooks said it's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| What about the other day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Okay, the last I heard about it, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| So I just want some clarity on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| because I've also heard that it can't have but one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| You can't, but the petition can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| A petition, your charter limits an ordinance to one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| It does not limit a petition to one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| But Bill, thank you for your question, because those are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| Now this has been flowing through, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| I mean, Brooks must have come up with a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| like a day or a year ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Well, the decision about whether or not they can be on the petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| as separate issues was decided way back in November or December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| by the state election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| There may have been questions locally, but I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| at the state...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| That's what Brooks said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| That's what Brooks said, and that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| We did not want to propose petitions that we hadn't vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| behind the scenes before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| Going back to what Commissioner Davis was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| also what this gentleman was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| he was saying he didn't want to stagger it because of some situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| but she's talking about five new people coming on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| it's taking them two years to get on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| before we can even put something like this on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| I'm saying if you have those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| then you won't have people that's all new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| and have to all have to learn at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| You have people that's kind of already familiar with things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| and those that are new that can work together to bring it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| I would hate to think that since you have the Jordan v. Mount Sinai,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| you have a chance to make changes to a government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| that's going to take you two years to get that on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| on the ballot box for the citizens to be able to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| and make any kind of comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| You can comment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| You said put it on the ballot or whatever for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| because you need to have that much time to get familiar with things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| You need to make sure that the legalities are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| I don't want to put anything on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| that you can come back and have a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| or that makes our charter unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| I understand you're talking about a length of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| where we ought to have a chance to get things done a little bit more expediently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| and get people that can understand and can bring it to the people and explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| And if you have to have some kind of committee to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| to make it clear for all of us to understand, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| But I don't think we need to waste more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| not waste just a bad choice of words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| but trying to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| Let me add one comment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| In terms of a timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| one of the issues we kept hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| in the original discussions that were held at the town hall meetings last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| these are different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| These are lists of items that voters want to see changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| They want to see something changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| With that list is the expectation that they will be done soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| These issues will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Quite frankly, there are people that want them done yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| But wanting it to happen and waiting several years to get it happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| was not the option in terms of what the voters wanted at the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| We put our timeline in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| basically because there was an interest in having these changes happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| at the very next opportunity to get this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| To answer a question that may not have been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| why not wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Because our impression and our feedback was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| we don't want to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| We'd like to do it at the next possible available time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| If this would be addressed to all the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| then what should happen here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| or at the next county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| is that an ad hoc committee should be appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| by those people that are most knowledgeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| about the county charter that is in place right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| and the petition that is on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Because if the concern is what she is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| is that there's inexperience on the commission to make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| then she's asking the wrong question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| And an ad hoc committee would be the perfect choice right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| to review everything on the petition and move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| Secondly, you never, ever want to deplete your knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| and your experience on any board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| by having everybody go out in one tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| That is absolutely unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| You do not want that on any board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| You always stagger your terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| because you have to have someone on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| with enough experience and knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| to bring the other freshmen, if you want to call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| into the fold of what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| So to have an ad hoc committee would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5377)|
| 1:29:48| Also, too, these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| the original language for the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| as we've discussed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| was proposed and provided to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| on September 9th of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| Now, that was a different commission environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| Obviously, we've had several new appointments since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| and we did not expect to have those new appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| But, of course, with the county issues that had arisen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| and certain laws that had to take effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| in the immediate time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| we had five new commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Eight, sorry, since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| And so September 9th was when we wanted to provide the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| to the commission such that between that time period and now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| there would be sufficient time to review the legalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| review the language, have discussions, have forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| whatever process is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| so that the public and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| understands what they're reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| And so our initial intent was to have that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| It wouldn't be two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| It wouldn't be a full year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| But it would be, in our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| plenty of time to go through those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| That was the original intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| And let me say, you know, timing on this is just very, very unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| because taking up for those 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| they had a lot on their plate from September through February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| They had a lot of things to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| and I frankly understand how several things, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| probably slipped through the cracks in terms of their agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| And I'd also like to slightly disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| And you went to court, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| I'd also like to slightly disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| as evidenced by having four newly appointed commissioners here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| And I think all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| I attended the forum at Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| As you see, Dr. Briggs and Commissioner Davis were fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| I think we're in pretty good shape in our knowledge of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| of the charter process of how the county government is operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| So I think the petition group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| in terms of the commissioners that were appointed by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| was a good group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| So with that, I'll follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| I'm only making that statement based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| I'm going to make one last plea for this ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| and to address some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| Everyone says, what's the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| There is a rush because we're going to do a voting on a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| I think it's the 25th of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| And we can either vote on a bad amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| or we can vote on one that we've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| And I'm not advocating putting them on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| or not putting them on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| but just in case these things pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| I want to have the best possible amendment that goes on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| I don't want a mistake to go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| And the second thing, even waiting until 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| and I thought that's an excellent point that you make about staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| Those are some problems because I can't draw on tank's experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| because I can't even talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| I mean, it doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| but that hopefully won't have that all behind us by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| So we could conceivably have 19 new commissioners in 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| because we don't have them staggered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| and that gets back to your point too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| So what I want to do is take two more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| and then we'll dismiss officially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| but hopefully we are willing to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| if people have additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| Ms. Nichols and I think Antonio had another question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| Well, I just wanted to respond to what Commissioner Davis said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| about the meeting at Geary High School because I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| And I know that we didn't go through those exercises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| just to have a round of red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| We went through those exercises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| so that actions would come out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| And so when you say that there was not discussion about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| that we were just giving ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| none of the people that I was around in that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| and I was there the whole time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| thought we were just going through an exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| that there was going to be something else that came out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| So there was action that was expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| And we were actually in the same room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| Yes, we had a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| We had an all-star group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| We had a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| There was a lot of discussion about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| and there was a lot of discussion about what next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| Everybody was talking about what next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| Councilwoman Barbara Pelow, Randy Tyree, ex-Mayor Randy Tyree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5669)|
| 1:34:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| I wanted to make sure you had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| Where is that at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| So Greg Johnson was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| There was several people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| In fact, your wife was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| Polly Ehlertal was in that group with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| And not one time did it say, or was the impression given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| this is something that there was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| that there was a movement to actually form any sort of other group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| or that these things were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| Maybe in yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| To me, you just validated this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| You named elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| There was not one elected official in my group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| It was filled with citizens who wanted action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| And Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| No, what I'm saying is you're saying that none of the people who were in your group said that this is the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5723)|
| 1:35:32| I'm talking about all the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| None of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| I'm going to have to pull out my expertise as a football official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| Flags on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| Antonio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| Yeah, let me just say one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| Again, I'm all in favor of downsizing this government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| I do believe that it can be done with keeping the proportionality for elected officials per population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5754)|
| 1:36:02| in retrospect to each section of the city where the most people live and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| My question is, again, it just goes back to my concern about what's brought to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5769)|
| 1:36:17| and their ability, which quite frankly I'm even surprised that there is the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5777)|
| 1:36:24| because does anyone realize that it almost looks like the county charter might conflict with the state constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5784)|
| 1:36:35| in regards to actually...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| A lot of conversations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| In fact, Commissioner Luto has always, but the county law director has on several occasions said, and it's varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5800)|
| 1:36:50| I mean, I think most of the time the citizens of Knox County voted for home rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| So that means a certain set of things are under our purview, but then others aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| And it takes a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| Just let me state it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| And to help to answer that question, I mean, that's the very first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| One of the questions that we answered before we started discussions with the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| Do they have a legal opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Well, it's in here, but I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| We have gathered a legal opinion on, including that question, okay, whether it does conflict with state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5837)|
| 1:37:26| And that legal opinion comes from the same attorneys that won the Jordan versus...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| Because if that's the case, then the law director would have to take it to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Antonio, I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| When the law director has been pressed on this issue and answered the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| he has given the opinion to county commission that if challenged, these amendments would be upheld in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| So, and I will also say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| A lot of folks don't realize this, that the language in the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5868)|
| 1:37:57| the law director and our attorneys have talked about the language in the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| And any concern the law director had, we have changed to make sure that they're on the same page with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5882)|
| 1:38:09| That's a different thing, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| I want to make sure you're understanding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| That's a different thing than somebody saying on commission, this word still confuses me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| This phrase still confuses me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| It will confuse the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Our intent would be that nothing goes before the voters that confuses them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| And so we are very willing to work with commission on an ad hoc committee if that's the way the chair wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5908)|
| 1:38:37| Not to change the substance or the spirit of these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| but to make sure there's no confusion whatsoever about what is ultimately voted on by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| if they voted by a two-thirds vote on the second reading fine, if they don't, fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| or what goes on a petition to go forward to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| Our interest is not to pull one over on the voters of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| Our interest is better government in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| Okay, we're going to take one question from Ms. Cox, and I'm going to give Mr. Brown the last word, and we can stay around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5941)|
| 1:39:09| My last statement is a request, and I request, as a citizen of Knox County, from my representative from District 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5949)|
| 1:39:19| if you would please consider having an ad hoc committee, review committee, whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| to discuss these amendments prior to your county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5966)|
| 1:39:33| I really think that's what this is, in terms of what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| Now, if the chair chooses to put together a committee and that committee meets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5978)|
| 1:39:49| I will commit to getting that information out in whatever way is best for the citizens of the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5989)|
| 1:39:59| as I'm sure all of the districts will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| I'm hoping that the Knoxville News, if we come up with a rock to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| we have changed these words, and now this is how these eight things look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| which is what I think Commissioner Briggs is wanting to do, to make sure that everything's clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| I will commit to make that material available to the citizens of the first district the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6015)|
| 1:40:23| Yes, open meetings and open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| A committee, a review, whatever it takes, to try to resolve and clean these amendments prior to county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6027)|
| 1:40:36| It's going to be – if this group, if this committee comes up with something to go on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6036)|
| 1:40:43| this first district committee that you're talking about aren't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| It doesn't have to be first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Well, okay, I thought you asked for a first district committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| She's asking for Briggs' ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| Okay, okay, I thought you were talking about a subsequent committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| No, yes, we will definitely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| And it would be nice if you would have the new Sentinel put it out for all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| That's what I would love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Not just district one, but –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| Yeah, that's why I thought she was talking about strictly for district one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| There are nine districts that you also represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| No, no, I thought her question was strictly for district one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| I'm giving you a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| I'm giving you a hard time, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| So, all right, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Last thing is, as Judy's reminding me, please take five minutes and fill out the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| and please leave them with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| That way we can report you to your center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| I want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| Commissioner Rountree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| Pat told me earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| Did I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| It was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| Oh, how terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| I want to say what a very professional job you did running this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6109)|
| 1:42:00| Sam, what is it you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| I'm going to pay you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| No, I'm sorry, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Mr. Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| We want to thank everyone for attending tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| And we just want to again reiterate that everything, including the specific language of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| the actual language as it stands right now, is on our website, www.knoxcharterpetition.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080331forum?start=6140)|
