| 0:01:36| Mr. Chairman, the witnesses have been sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| Okay, Madam Clerk, will you read the first item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| Consideration of suspension, revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| CVS Pharmacy, number 02404417, East Emory Road, Tennessee, CVS Pharmacy, LLC, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=108)|
| 0:01:59| Okay, do we have a representative from CVS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Will you come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| Okay, Mr. Law Director, you can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Would you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| John Williams, 1330 Unisha Road, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| John, what the procedures are here today is that we will bring forth the allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| and the facts will be presented before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| After the facts have been presented, then you'll have an opportunity to affirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| or deny the allegations that are presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| You'll also have an opportunity to present your side of the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| at which time it will be turned over to the beer board for deliberation as to the conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| So, at this time, we will call the Sheriff's Department up to bring forth the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=165)|
| 0:02:58| I'm Alan Wolfey May, Captain with the Knox County Sheriff's Office and the beer inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| On April 9, 2013, I sent a person in to CVS on Emory to buy a six-pack of beer and bought some Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=184)|
| 0:03:22| And they are not a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| Would the party come back to please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| John, do you affirm or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| I affirm that the beer was purchased, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| Do you have anything in your defense you'd like to bring before this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| It was an error with our computer system because the cashier enters the date of birth in our computer system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| and it does stop the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| We had a download that previous Sunday that didn't have the parameters set correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| Therefore, it did not stop the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| She did have a requirement to check the ID, and we have had training since then with all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| We have also checked the downloads at each of our locations to make sure that they had the correct parameters set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| And it is a very unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=271)|
| 0:04:42| Make a motion then that we go ahead and do the $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I move for a $500 fine and second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Mr. Shouse, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Anything that you'd like to say, Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| Spices North, 950 East Emory Road, Spino LLC, owner, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Do we have a representative from Spices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| Would you come forward, sir, and give us your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| Lee Mayshark, 1802 McAllis, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Mr. Law Director, Mr. Mayshark is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| Mr. Mayshark, you heard earlier the procedure today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| The allegations will be brought before you here in this body by the accusing party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| You will have an opportunity to affirm or deny those allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| and present your side of the story before the beer board deliberates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=358)|
| 0:06:06| This place is also not a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| April 9th, 2013, sent some underage in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| and they sat at a table and ordered a Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=376)|
| 0:06:29| Mr. Mayshark, do you affirm or deny the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| No, it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Do you have anything to present to this body in your defense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| We preach to those employees every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| Short of reading every idea ourselves, we're not sure what else we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| The only thing we have done since then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| is make them recite the legal drinking date every day they come to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| This kid knew better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| He looked right at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| As soon as he set it down, I think he realized what he'd done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| I'm assuming all of you all have this letter of the same establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| On May 23rd, ABC went in and tried to buy alcoholic beverages and was not able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=431)|
| 0:07:22| This was Bethany, I'm assuming that's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| Kind of a contradiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| It's a contradiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| You've got one that does and one that don't, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=450)|
| 0:07:38| Well, you know, this is the second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| which is a little stiffer than the first offense usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| So I'll defer to the commissioner in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| What I would like to say, though, before you start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| this is something that the Sheriff's Department also does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| When they go in and make a buy and they're denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| they also get a thank you congratulatory letter from the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| And I think that's important that everybody knows who is doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| And our job up here is to weed out those that don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Mr. Mashart, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Well, yeah, briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| The first time Wolfie came in, we'd been there about, I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| three or four weeks, maybe five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| And we had inherited most all his employees at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| And like this time, that girl's fired on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| This kid is never coming back in there again either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| But I just want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Well, one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| This is a second offense since you've had it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Yeah, the first one was when we'd been there about three weeks, two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Commissioners, I've been in there several times and seen Mr. Mashart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| And they're trying to turn the place around, even trying to make it family friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| And I've been impressed with their trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| Like I say, Commissioner Brown, that was just, he had just opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| I remember it very vividly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| He had just opened and had that incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| But I'll make a motion to do the $1,000 fine for second offense or the, is it 60 days, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| For second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Sixty days, whichever that you prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| Mr. Mashart, what's your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| What was part B of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Sixty days suspended or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| We'll pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| I'll make a motion to the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Okay, any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Opposed? Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Thank you, Mr. Mashart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| New Smokies 7217C Clinton Highway, Discount Tobacco Pack, Incorporated, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=593)|
| 0:10:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Will you tell us your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| John Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| What was your last name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| Go ahead, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| John, if you heard before, you'll have allegations brought before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| The allegations will be presented to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| You'll have an opportunity to affirm or deny those allegations to present the facts of your case before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| At this time, I'll ask the Sheriff's Department to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| On April 9, 2013, sent an underage person into New Smokies 7217 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=642)|
| 0:10:52| And Mr. Baker here, who's the owner, was also the one that was cited for underage sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=652)|
| 0:11:01| Sold a six-pack of Bud Light Platinum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=661)|
| 0:11:09| Is he a responsible vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| He is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| Mr. Baker, you heard the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| I affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Would you like to present any evidence here on your behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Basically, what happened was I looked at the ID, did the math wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| I was in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| What we've done in the meantime is took Wolfie's advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| Our point of sale system, we added the program that makes you type in the license so it can do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| Take out the human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Mr. Chairman, do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| You know, this is, I think, five years that I've been sitting up here in this chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=709)|
| 0:11:58| And I can't remember one other time when it was the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| And I happen to be the owner's wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| It's usually a clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| When the owner of a business who's had the training does this, to me it's a little more serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| Well, it's serious both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| But it's even more serious when it's the owner versus a sales clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| So, you know, I just like to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| Well, just real quick, Officer May, what's the general cost of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| Something else I've heard over this last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| You know, I keep hearing the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| I won't call it an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| But the reason that, you know, software, I had to do it in my head, I misstated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| even though there's stickers that say if you're born after this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| How much does it cost to install that software on average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| On average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| And you may not be able to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| If you can't answer it specifically or in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| is it an expensive undertaking for these stores and markets to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| Every underage person under the age of 21, beside their picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| there's a red stripe that says under 21 until June 1, 2014, 15, or whenever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=795)|
| 0:13:24| They don't have to do any math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| All they have to do is look at the red stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| In the state of Tennessee, anyone under the age of 21 has an ID that says under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=808)|
| 0:13:37| You know, and, again, I'm not making any disparaging remarks toward you, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| because we just hear this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| And there's just a lot of we've done a pretty good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| We mean in the state of Tennessee, and I'm sure other states, done a pretty good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| of trying to curb underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| And it just, it bothers me when these measures are overridden, ignored, they slip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=834)|
| 0:14:04| So I just, again, I'm just, I struggle a lot with us having this same conversation about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| I didn't see the date or didn't do the math right and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| I just tend to, again, I struggle with continuing to endorse these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| I understand that, and I completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Up until last month, I was in your shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| And, you know, it cost, the cost wasn't big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| It's a few hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| But I remember at the time when I was setting up the system, I thought, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| I'm the one that's there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| You know, how hard is it to read a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| And that was the feeling I had until this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| I've been working on and off in different fields and sold beer or liquor for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| And this was the first issue I've ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| And I guess pride, I just thought it was something easy to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| but it happened to be caught at the wrong time when I just gave it a glance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| and didn't look at it long enough, and here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| So, make sure that something like that doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| Okay, Mr. Baker, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Would you just step us through this specific instance with the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| Do you remember the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| I mean, the date of this person's driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| What's going on in your head in terms of the calculation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| When the gentleman came in, I was actually on the phone with one of my vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| and so I was trying to do two things at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| He showed me the date, or, well, he showed me the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| I grabbed the card, and what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| You saw it had a red stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Honestly, I didn't pay attention to the red stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| I never even thought about the red stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| That's probably something that hasn't been beat into my head enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| because if I looked at two cards and I saw one overage and underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| then I would think about it more, but I've always just thought about looking at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| And for me, because you are an owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| it illustrates also how the pressures of running the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| and doing the various things that you have to do over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| I mean, just overrode your ability at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| I mean, it was truly just a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| And so I think that happens more than we realize, and so I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=993)|
| 0:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Do we have Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| I want to build on Commissioner McKenzie's question just a little bit, this expense deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| After the fact, now, and please, we're not really piling on, but we are in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| because if Commissioner Brown is saying that we've only had one owner here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1021)|
| 0:17:10| before my memory begins, I guess, but the outcome of this underage sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1030)|
| 0:17:19| you're here in front of us as the owner possessing the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| What else has happened to you also being the person that made the underage sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| Did you get cited to court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Is that taking place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Talk to us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Because we you're raw meat, so we're all going to jump on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| Yes, actually I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| It was last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| I don't remember the exact date, but I had the booking process and had to pay the court fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| It's a misdemeanor, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| I've got basically a year to get it off my record with the plea deal and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| And I think with the court costs was just under $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| So, you know, what it's meant for me, outside of just the awful general embarrassment of what I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| was the court fees there, whatever happens with today, the year on the record for the misdemeanor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1094)|
| 0:18:23| you know, assuming I don't get in any more trouble before I can have it expunged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| But it's been a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| It's a wake-up call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Went into it thinking, you know, how hard is it to look at an I.D.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| You know, yeah, I've got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| It's not like I'm having to worry about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| someone with spices who has hundreds of employees that they have to deal with and beat that into their head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| You know, this is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| I've got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| I've had the store right out of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| But it was eye-opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| And so what I'm trying to do is, like I said, make improvements to make myself slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| You know, if I'm in a situation where I'm trying to do two or three things at once, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1139)|

| 0:19:53| I had a question about, well, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| I'll hold it for you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| All in favor for the $500 say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Thank you, Mr. Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| By the way, we have about a seven-day limit to pay these fines in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| All of you all who owe the fines, you have seven days to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Where do we pay those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| The clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| And that was one of the things that was related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| It was really not to you, Mr. Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| What I was thinking of was trying to envision the circumstance that happens a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| And I guess it's more to Captain Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| And that is, Wolfie, when you go in to have people sell, is it, I know you've got a guy that looks over 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1235)|
| 0:20:48| who isn't when you try to catch for underage, is it your habit to have them in a line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1248)|
| 0:20:58| like go at a very stressful business time and say, okay, we're not going to have, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| John's our guy that's the underager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| John, you wait until there's a line of six at the cash register, and then we want you to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| Is that the way it's done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| I mean, is it a you try to catch the vendor in an enhanced, stressful situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| I just am curious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| He just goes to Seventh District and stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| The way we do is I pick a certain direction we're going, east, north, south or west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| And we basically start on one side of the road, and we go up across the street on Emery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| We went from Clinton Highway all the way to Maryville Pike, every place that sells beer in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| whether we're there at two in the afternoon or seven at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| We don't pick a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Last week we checked 26 places, cited three, which you'll see next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| And they're on different sections of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| So I kind of work my way around all the different districts that are represented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| I shun none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| And we don't pick, like, we may start at noon, we may start at four in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| but we go straight down the road and just whatever time we happen to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| If there's one customer or ten customers, that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Do you find that at 530 or 6 o'clock in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| those three tend to hit more between 5 and 7 or whatever than they do at 12 to 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| Or is there any correlation between the time of day and the tendency to sell to the underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| Always has to do with the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| They're either going to pay attention to their ID and not sell or they're going to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| It makes no difference what time of day or not we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| I just had one question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| What is your you mentioned that you checked 26 places and you hit three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| You know, that's roughly one in nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Is that about how it goes or one in nine, one in ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| Well, on this month we're talking about we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| We checked 31 places, cited four places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| Out of the 26 I checked, three are not in business any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| So I actually got three out of 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| Sometimes we don't get any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| I mean, I'll check 20 places and not cite a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| Sometimes I've started out first six places, cite five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| So there's no rhyme or reason to count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1433)|
| 0:24:04| Sell beer or not sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1448)|

| 0:25:15| purchased a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1515)|

| 0:25:32| Well, the cashier was in the process of changing the shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| She punched in the date of birth and denied the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=1535)|

| 0:50:03| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| I can't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Daniel Boutte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3006)|

| 0:50:16| Hopefully a pack for everybody and then these are just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| kind of show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3023)|
| 0:50:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3055)|
| 0:51:20| We need you to go to the microphone over there Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| Yeah if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| And then give us name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Daniel Boutte 1304 Sumac 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| As most of you guys are aware I am a local landscape architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| I called most of you guys individually to just try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| give you an idea of who I am and what I'm working towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| I work for a company Barge Wagner Sumner and Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| And over the last five years roughly I've been working to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| to develop and build a disc golf course out at Tommy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Schumpert Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| I brought this as kind of a little show and tell so you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| can see the somewhat sophistication of our sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| And I understand that from some conversations with Doug that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| guys brought this up in your last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| So I'm here in some ways to kind of revisit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| Talk about some of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| I did pass some some information around what I included was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| overall course map that shows the entire 18 hole course as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| it's been cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| There has been a large group of people through the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| Disc Golf Association that's volunteered a lot of time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| It's hard to put a number on it but it's literally been five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| years of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| We have cleared and manipulated the fairway so that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| resemble a hiking trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| I have included some photos so you guys can see what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| I went through the effort of getting pavers permeable pavers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| donated roughly thirty eight hundred dollars in materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| five hundred dollars in delivery fee got that donated for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| course and also have that set up to be funded and provided for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| the back nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| And I guess what I'm really here for is to kind of suggest or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| recommend support and whatever way it politically makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| I apparently am a little bit too late for the overall park and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| rec budget adjustment but through some conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| some of you guys Brad had a really wonderful suggestion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| some creative ideas on how to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| We're not asking for a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| I've suggested that fifteen thousand dollars would polish up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| the back nine and that would provide for baskets on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| nine that would provide for the tee pad construction in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| fairway clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| So kind of you know long story short and I know everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| time is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Basically what we have out here is a swimming pool with a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| filled amount of water and how many of you guys would show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| to swim in a pool that's half filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| I personally travel anywhere from four to twelve hours over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| the weekends to just go play other courses as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Charlotte Athens Augusta driven up to Ohio driven to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| Oklahoma City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Long story short this is a sport that is only behind MMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| This is the fastest growing sport in the country and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| the last 10 to 15 years as it's embraced its ball golf roots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| it's become more professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| There are actually people making more than I am as a professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| licensed landscape architect playing disc golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| So I guess without spending a whole bunch of your time I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| here to encourage and suggest that we work with Doug Battelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| and not against him to ensure that the back nine has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| funding it needs to be constructed before the season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| overtakes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| It is as many of you guys know if you spend any time in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| natural spaces we have a poison ivy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| It is a family sport and I'm concerned about you know parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| bringing their kids out and getting them covered in poison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| ivy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| So I guess what I'm speaking towards now is not only do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| need an initial investment in the back nine we need some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| of commitment from the maintenance and operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| budget that we would be able to maintain what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| I've included some pictures of you know families that I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| saw out while Larry Smith actually came out and walked the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| course with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| We saw a family that just was like almost like I'd paid them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| to come out which I didn't by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| It's it's a really great course and I know I'm biased because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| am the course designer but it's it's integrated some concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| that are unusual to other courses regionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| We've got two separate tee pads and on all the holes two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| separate baskets so it can be made very short for beginners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| or very long for tournament players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| And that's really kind of the other key and one of the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| things I'm going to mention is that there is a professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| organization the PDGA that requires a city to have four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| 18 hole courses before it can have a tier one event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| So we at the county currently has no 18 hole courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| There is Victor Ash which is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| It's an 18 hole course and Morningside is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| It's an 18 hole course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| So the city's got two and the county's got two nine holers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| With that said are there any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| OK thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3381)|
| 0:56:21| Thank you Mr. Boutte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| I am because of your energy and your efforts of course there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| already a discussion that's ongoing as we anticipate the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3387)|
| 0:56:35| this budget works itself out in coming months in and adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| are made and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| But you've got the attention of several people and and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| Mr. Battelle is aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| But there's several lights on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| So I'll I'll let these people ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| Mr. Smith I saw yours first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| Brad had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| Oh OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3414)|
| 0:56:54| Mr. Anders go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| I was going to tell Mr. Boutte that I have spoken with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| mayor's office over the weekend and after our phone call and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| think that without changing the budget at all I think we can can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| And I think that I think the mayor understands what you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| put into it and what your company and your group has put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| I think that you'll find over the next couple of weeks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| months that we'll get it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Mr. Hammond Doug Battelle would you come to the microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| I appreciate the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| We played phone tag a lot over the last few days and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| But Doug where are you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Yes as we talked about last week we've got several projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| that we have in house and within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| So that's a plan for this is that we have some once we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| down with some of the repairs we're doing up a jumper park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| we're going to have a little bit of money left there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| I've got designated some more amusement tax money for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| project too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| So spring summer of next year is what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| That'll be in-house construction project to start this on its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| We're actually going to start the mowing which we think we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| do within our our current budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| If we see we're having any issues we may come back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| next year but it wouldn't be a huge increase at all to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| But we're pretty confident we can cover within the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3497)|
| 0:58:17| So basically you're saying this is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3500)|
| 0:58:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Mr. Smith and I want to personally thank you for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| you've done and looked at the pictures and stuff that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| passed down and walked out there and viewed you save the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| taxpayers a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| You're in your group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3511)|
| 0:58:31| But what's the work that you've done clearing the brush and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| whatnot that saved us quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| I think the least we can do is finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| I think the most important thing is what impressed me the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| of talking to you is we can't hold the tournaments the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| national tournaments unless you have 18 holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| It's like playing golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| They're not going to hold a nine nine hole golf course and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| hold a national tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Same thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| So we need 18 and motels are right there at the exit where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| you are so that it's going to be a big plus for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| to have you done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| You know I was impressed when I went out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| I've seen other disc golf courses but yours was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| landscaped nice and the pavers and stuff that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| I think your background brought brought a lot to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| So it's going to be first class when you finish and Doug will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| his group will continue to monitor it and they do great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| work too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3563)|
| 0:59:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3564)|
| 0:59:24| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Thank you Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| Doug just from personal experience I know we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| about putting this on the agenda for next year but I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| recommend getting on the poison ivy this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| That way you can have some green grass because you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| it's going to take some some killing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| I know that from experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| I didn't realize you were a disc golfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| But I got a lot of poison ivy on my farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3593)|
| 0:59:53| And as Commissioner Smith said Daniel and his group has done a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| tremendous job and we have a huge amount of volunteers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| help out throughout the park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| So we deeply appreciate their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3605)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| But I thank you Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3609)|
| 1:00:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| So you can take your this thing with you I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| The next person I have on the public forum list is Margo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| Margo Klein here and she also wanted to have a PowerPoint so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| I don't see her front getting her stuff ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| We'll put her off till the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| And she may want to speak possibly during the item on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| I also have a note for Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| It's Kevin Murphy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3653)|
| 1:00:53| And it's also an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| So if he shows up later I'll we'll call on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| And in my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| The first one actually is Trudy Monaco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Miss Monaco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| And I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| This is on Kandora.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| So seeing that she's not here we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| Vic Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Mr. Spencer is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| And are you ready to go Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| And so again give Mr. Spencer give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| And we have five minutes that Mike's not going to work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| Mike's that Mike's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| I am Vic Spencer 1 1 0 1 2 Flotilla Drive Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| May I try to use the other Mike the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3712)|
| 1:02:06| Would you please switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Could you please switch the display to my line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3728)|
| 1:03:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3788)|
| 1:03:38| Do you like my presentation so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3818)|
| 1:03:52| Beautiful, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Thank you, it's coming up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| Okay, all connections are solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| Okay, so we don't know what's happening to the display,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3846)|
| 1:04:14| and I'm going to talk you through it if you would be kind enough to give me the extra minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| Last week some of you were not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| and I was showing in the first display the rising expenses for the past 13 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| and also the ACT scores for the past 13 years basically remaining flat or in a slight decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3874)|
| 1:04:47| The ACT score by itself may not mean anything to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| but let me just explain something that is very specific that I'm dealing with for the first time with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| It's called ACT's Job Readiness Figure and how it's arrived at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3900)|
| 1:05:07| It's based on four tests, English Composition, minimum score 18, Social Science, minimum score 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3907)|
| 1:05:18| Algebra score, minimum score 22, and Biology score, minimum 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| If a student meets all of these four minimums, then they are considered career and college ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3925)|
| 1:05:34| Now, this is the result of empirical studies that ACT has done since prior to 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| and they compared the grades that students received to the actual vocations years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3943)|
| 1:05:51| that they have managed to also achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| It only means, according to ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| that those meeting all four of the above have a 75% chance to finish the first year of tech school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3959)|
| 1:06:08| first year of college, or to be trained for a job today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| Otherwise, I think it's obvious that it's a welcome to close to minimum wage employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| and increasing unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| I have a chart that unfortunately I cannot show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| but it shows what percentage of students for the last four years have achieved in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3987)|
| 1:06:36| the career and college readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| The figure is very close to 80% who did not achieve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| 80%, 79% to 81% to be specific, did not achieve that metric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4007)|
| 1:06:57| It's very specific on what it means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| and those who have not achieved that, what that means in terms of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| ACT further published that meeting the career and college readiness means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| that a student is going to be able to provide minimal sustenance through his job for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4034)|
| 1:07:26| So this is a very minimal baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| I would like to mention one thing that I experienced through my business experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| for more than 40 years in a large organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| I found that losers make excuses and point to others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| and I also found that winners identify the problems and solve them without complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| There are some uncontrollable variables in the education systems everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4078)|
| 1:08:06| One of them is discipline problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| It is related to parental litigiousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| My question would be how many have requested in writing from legislature law changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4094)|
| 1:08:23| to make things easier on the schools in terms of parental litigiousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| and is the decision-making on the teacher level to protect teacher authority in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| This is a very important thing to deal with discipline issues at the source in any job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| and that includes teaching as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| Second, there is parental support issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| and my question there would be is the public informed about how poorly both the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| and the school system are doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| If not, what do you expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| Parents would assume that things are better than what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Now, Mr. Spencer, we're trying to adjust, you know, given the technical problem that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| but probably your five minutes are just about up, so go ahead and finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| I have five more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| Probably that would be excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Could you finish your comments, summarize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| And then if we have questions, we'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| What all this leads to that I am telling you is I have on the slide the picture of a homeless guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| who is sitting on the curb with a shopping basket that's full of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| And when the figure is 80% that we release from our high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| not only here but in all of Tennessee, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| I would like you to think about what that will result in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| because very few parents are going to be paying 30K for two years of remedial training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4202)|
| 1:10:10| on the junior college level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| So most of these people out there are going to present a social problem the size of which we have not seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| I would like to add that of all democratic groups, demographic groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| black students figures are 97% who are not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| And if you don't think that that's going to be acting like a fuse on this huge barrel of powder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4231)|
| 1:10:41| that's going to explode, I think you are kidding yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| And I am very disappointed that I do not see more people standing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| and voicing their opinion that fine, use a goal like 190, 90, 90, which really doesn't mean much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4251)|
| 1:11:02| But for us, please bless us with a commitment on what kind of ACT average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| consolidated ACT average we are going to see from you after we approve your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| or approve any additional finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| I think that would be a worthwhile first move and it wouldn't be excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| And this is all I have to say other than I have a couple of suggestions, but my time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Thank you, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| And we appreciate your work and your presentation to the workshop the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| And we are listening and we do appreciate your efforts in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| Since we've got this school topic up, I did want to offer to Dr. McIntyre, if he would like to respond now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| you're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| It's whatever the school person would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Would you like to say anything, Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Any questions from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| Okay, seeing no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Thank you, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Sorry we had the technical problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| We had some other folks that had signed up from public forum that we called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| Did anybody else who had signed for public forum would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Nobody's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Margo Klein, Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| So we'll move on into we're short on time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| We're going to try to move as quickly as we can through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| So we're going on to our honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| And the first one that's on the agenda is going to be postponed for Ms. Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4365)|
| 1:12:53| And then we took care of Ms. Seidler at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| And so we'll be moving on to the next resolution, Madam Clerk, which is for Ms. Acuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4381)|
| 1:13:15| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| honoring Mabel Wolfe Acuff upon the occasion of her 100th birthday celebration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| Resolution 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Yes, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| In the interest of moving along, I first want to say, and you'll hear it two more times today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| in case you missed it, Gibbs High School has turned 100-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| As a part of that, one of the original no, I shouldn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| One of the original instructors at Gibbs is with us today, but in spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| Neva Cardin was a member of the first graduating class and was at Gibbs High School, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| during this particular tenure and also while I was in the first grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| Today is an important day because we're recognizing a 100th-year birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| I'm sure Ms. Acuff has made the rounds of the Corrington Community Club, the Gibbs High School 100th anniversary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| and lots of other celebrations at church and in the community recognizing her birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4468)|
| 1:14:38| But what I need to stop and say is that I remember her as a wife of Herb Acuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4478)|
| 1:14:46| and to help my dad as my dad was getting back out of the Second World War| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| and into a business of being a dairy farmer and a trucker and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| So there are lots of things to be celebrated today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| A 100th birthday is just one of the small ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| But we do have a resolution, and if it could be read into the record, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| Go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| Whereas on May 7, 2013, Mabel Wolfe Acuff celebrated her 100th birthday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4515)|

| 1:15:53| following in her mother's footsteps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| and whereas Mabel's first teaching job was at John Sevier School, where she taught third grade through high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4555)|

| 1:16:08| and teaching those same students again in high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| whereas Mabel remained at Gibbs until she retired in 1978 after a remarkable 43 years of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| and education in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4578)|

| 1:16:51| who later became Mabel and Herbert's daughter-in-law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| and served in the Knox County Finance Department for over 45 years until her recent retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| and whereas Mabel's family has grown over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4620)|

| 1:18:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| One of the things that is before us right now is we're recognizing not just 100 years of birthdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4696)|
| 1:18:25| but we're recognizing the lady that has been out and been the moving force behind lots of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| In fact, she has so much going on in her life that she just made her second trip to Stone Mountain on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| Your first trip was when, 1939?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| 1939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| First trip was 1939, and it's just been now that she's been able to reschedule to revisit Stone Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| So on behalf of Knox County, it's my extreme pleasure to give you a copy of this proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| And then we'll get a few words now from Knox County Mayor Tim Berkley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4737)|
| 1:19:06| Mabel, you want to sit down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| I won't take as long as he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| Well, stand up here beside me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| I like it when good-looking women stand over here by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| Come over here, Mabel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| No, we're going to have Tim Burch at 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| But when she saw Jack Huddleston here, she leaned over to her son and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| Oh, Lord, it's Jackie Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| Go get my switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| So we've got four of her former students back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| Oh, actually five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| But she said, Don't take long, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| She says, My Corvette is double parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| So everything's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| I just want to thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| My mama was a schoolteacher, and that means a whole lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| And, Mabel, you've done some great things for this community, mainly giving birth to a pretty cool son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| He's had enough sense to marry a woman way ahead of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| And this county is indebted to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| And, of course, your husband's service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| And we just love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| So thank you so much for everything you do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| Thank you, Mr. Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| And another proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| It's almost the exact same thing, and I won't bore you with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| So I'm just going to hand that to you, sweetheart, and you just carry that right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=4811)|

| 1:35:56| Resolution 805,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5756)|

| 1:36:24| Seeing none, you can sit down, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Resolution 806,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| establishing the Knox County tax rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| for the physical year beginning July 1, 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| and ending June 30, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| Okay, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I just do have a question on this with reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| Will we be looking at an adjusted tax rate next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| I think it adjusted in October, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| So will we be voting on it in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| or do we have to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| I mean, we have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Here comes Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| 2400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| The reappraisal rate will go to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| and will be approved and we'll get it back either in July or August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| And the property assessor will bring that forward to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| And then at that point we will approve the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And since it's revenue neutral to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| the penny on the tax rate will go up, the rate will go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| And so it's neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| But we will show you how that runs through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| It would be July or August before the tax rules are sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| So the rate we're approving now will be in effect for a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| and then we will readjust it depending on the reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| But it's revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| We just have to do it based on appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| I just wanted to get that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Okay, Mr. Caldwell, just while you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| and for the sake of the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| you gave us some information in anticipation of that tax rate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| Could you just give a little bit of that for the people that are here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| As far as the rate or, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| What you anticipate based on revenues and reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| I think it was in the paper Friday or Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| The anticipated property tax rate will go from $236,000 down to $232,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5908)|
| 1:38:35| What that will mean, we'll have to do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| But if that is the true rate that's approved by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| that means the penny on the tax rate goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| Budget is neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| And we have budgeted for the proposal that you just approved $1,030,000 per penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5927)|
| 1:38:55| And so what will happen is that will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| I don't know the number right off, but $1,035,000 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| It will go up a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| And that will basically be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| I mean, it's just neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| Okay, I have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=5951)|

| 1:40:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Okay, and there was one aspect of this one that we discussed, that I discussed, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6056)|
| 1:41:07| law director discussed with me, and that was that if this document is not available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6067)|
| 1:41:17| sort of the order of penalty goes by our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| The first, and there will be a period of time, 60 to 90 days, where there's a grace period for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| as we implement this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| And then if there is, if the business does not have this in place, it's just a letter at the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6089)|
| 1:41:39| Okay, and then after that, our normal sequence of penalties would go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| So I just wanted to let the body know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| Okay, so any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6108)|

| 1:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| Okay, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| If I could, if you would allow me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| I think some of the people that are still here, like for the libraries and the rescue squad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| we didn't have any questions about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| but I do want to talk about a little bit what the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| and Chris discussed with us about once last week was brought up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Everything in the library's budget that they needed, felt that they needed to do on capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| and the rescue squad's contract has been renegotiated for what we believe to be a better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| I just want to make people in the audience clear that some of those things that we discussed last week are being taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| I just wanted to get that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| because I think there are some people still here wondering how we breezed through that without a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| Mr. Caldwell, would you fill that in just a bit for us, put some meat on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6165)|
| 1:42:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| Really easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| After the workshop Monday, my staff and me, we sat down and worked with Marita Black and Scott Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6176)|
| 1:43:07| and went through some things where through savings on previous capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6187)|
| 1:43:14| or through monies where they had got capital dollars in previous years had rolled over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6194)|
| 1:43:23| there was money there for them to do needed capital projects that maybe was not approved in this budget document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| Once we made them aware of that, then we worked with them to determine what projects they would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6210)|
| 1:43:37| And that part was taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| And then we sat down and you did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| Jason Lay in my office did a projection on where they're going to end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| He showed a surplus and went over it with the finance director of the library, Scott Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| and they came to an agreement on an amount that they're going to end the year with a surplus with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| And so with those surplus dollars, they will be allowed to purchase the needed computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| that was removed from their budget in order to give employees a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6243)|
| 1:44:11| So that takes care of the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| Volunteer Rescue Squad, the mayor instructed me to sit down with Hugh Holt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| and we sat down and he called the Volunteer Rescue Squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| and basically we're going to amend their current year contract next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6263)|
| 1:44:30| which will come before you all in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| That will be for $100,000, and it will be for the purchase of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| And so that's how that will be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| And I think everything else is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| If I could, I see Dr. Frazier back in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Dr. Frazier and Deputy Chief Whitehead, if they'd like to come from the Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| He came out of surgery just to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| I don't know if you've had a chance to talk to Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| Any comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| Okay, Dr. Frazier, give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Russ Frazier, Chief of Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad, 512 Chill Highway Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6308)|
| 1:45:16| Deputy Chief John Whitehead, 3522 Shop Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| I did get the wonderful news a few days ago about the increased funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| and I would like to publicly thank the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| We've been hurting for a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| and we've stepped up and done what we can to increase funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| Mayor Burchett, Chris Caldwell has worked alongside with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| and we really, really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| We appreciate the county commission's time in addressing our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| Deputy Chief, do you have anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| Was that your group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| I heard on the radio this morning about, I think it was a volunteer rescue squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| that went down to Georgia this weekend and got somebody out of a cave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| That was a long trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| Our cave and vertical team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| Our structural collapse and cave and vertical team also respond regionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| They are so well trained and specialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| We get calls from the surrounding area on a pretty regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| One last thing, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| I'd like to, of course, introduce Leanne Cates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| She's the Executive Director, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| If you'll stand up and just say hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| But it would be great for us, if we can sometime, to have it at our commissioner's luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| to have them talk about everything that they do and better inform us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| Yes, that would be fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| We'll try to arrange that through our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| and give you a call and see when it would be convenient for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Thank you, gentlemen, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| If I could, I'd like to commend public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| I know we've kind of done it a little bit privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| I'd like to commend Chris on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| And the budget process this year was very smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| And, you know, we just passed a $700-something million budget without a single question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| And so I think that's pretty impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| And I think Chris and the mayor's office have done a great job presenting that to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| and working through with every department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| And thank you for all that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| And this is a difficult process to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| And, of course, I personally thank you for your help that you give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| and our private seminars and Mr. Lay and all these people that do help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Page 17, Ordinance 104, Amending Knox County Code, Chapter 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| Article 2, Entitled Peddlers and Solicitors to Provide Certain Additional Exemptions for Programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| Operated by Not-for-Profit Organizations in Section 12-27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| Ordinance No. 097-5101, Adopted 7-28-97, First Reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| There were some questions Mr. Hammond had, some information that you needed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| Well, I received that and I'm not going to bring it up today, but I intend to bring it up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6501)|
| 1:48:27| The $55 per month fee, to me, seems to be a bit excessive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| particularly with people who, like I mentioned, the lady who called me who wants to sell potholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| And she was given erroneous information, and I feel like somebody is trying to gouge her for some extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| That's why I wanted to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| But under this ordinance, it's $55 a month for however long you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6523)|
| 1:48:49| I'm going to be asking that we maybe revisit that and have some more discussion on that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| But as far as the nonprofit, I'm all in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| But I did want to talk about this pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| I think that we need to take another look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| and just look at maybe have $55 for 90 days or a period of time as opposed to every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| They have to get a new license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| But anyway, I will bring that up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Thank you very much, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| J.J., can you come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| You thought you were going to get out of here easy today, didn't you, J.J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| J.J., we're talking about the peddler's bill is what we're talking about on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| Will you be able to or have you been talking with CODES?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| Are you going to be able to help CODES out and try to enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| We had set some time aside to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| So as soon as you decide what it is you're going to pass and do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| then we'll certainly get together with them and help them any way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| We appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| I mean, CODES can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| but I think your guys showing up in uniform can get results a lot quicker than the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6586)|
| 1:49:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| We're all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment about the same thing that Commissioner Hammond did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| is that that did seem like that that's for a license for a peddler is a little high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| What we're really trying to do is to regulate them and prevent it from becoming a traffic hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6605)|
| 1:50:11| where people are parking along the edge of the roads and just completely unregulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| And, you know, I think even if it were $50 for six months would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| we're not trying to make money off of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| And you start talking about, you know, $50 a month plus $50 for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| I mean, all of a sudden the people selling these little trinkets aren't making any money off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| And I agree with you completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| And I've had concerns about that ever since we brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| And that will go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| There needs to be some kind of distinction on the size of the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| And I say that for this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| You have an out-of-county nursery setting up on a semi-permanent basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6655)|
| 1:51:07| taking probably 1,200, 1,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6667)|
| 1:51:14| versus the little lady of Mike's that's selling potholders for her Sunday school class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6674)|
| 1:51:21| and they're giving the money to missions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| There needs to be some way we can make some kind of distinction on a semi-permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| versus, you know, I'm a weekend here to a year or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6692)|
| 1:51:39| Well, in our discussion, why don't we, as we investigate, we'll invite Roy back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| and we'll go over this and visit what's appropriate for a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| and what isn't depending on the size of the operation, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| And we don't want to encourage things that we're trying to discourage based on the fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| but we don't want to prevent people from benefiting from their sales either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| You know, I understand what Commissioner Hammond is doing, so I'll support this this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6731)|
| 1:52:19| But I was just going to come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| I just think we probably need to defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| There's just so many items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| It's like we're dealing with nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| and then knowing we're going to come back and do some other things with pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| So this ordinance, we can go with, you know, iterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| or we can just try to get a comprehensive change to what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| and present something that's clear and concise and everybody understands, easily enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| The sheriff knows what page he's on, and we'll, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| probably move forward with a better piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| So I'm not going to support this ordinance for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| I understand what we're trying to do with nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| but I'd rather us just get all that pulled in together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| and present something in a more unified fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| We've got first reading, and it's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| Maybe we can handle some of these in between in terms of combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| Go ahead, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| The only change that we could make between the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| and second reading would be an insubstantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| Anything substantial is going to have to come back to be first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| Maybe it's prudent to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| until we've had this further discussion, workshop, whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| and get some of the I's dotted and the T's crossed before we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| then it can go through like slick as butter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| The only question that I would have, if we're trying to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| or we're trying to avoid damage to the nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| what would the status of the nonprofit be right now, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6848)|
| 1:54:15| Can they operate or would they have to adhere to their ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6855)|
| 1:54:22| the people that are under the umbrella of the licensee of the nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6862)|
| 1:54:28| would each individual booth have to get a license right now if we put this off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| Right now they'd be subject to the ordinance as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| So they would have to comply with the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| and each booth underneath would have to buy their $55 license to be in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6881)|
| 1:54:48| unless they are exempted, which is what this ordinance is designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6888)|
| 1:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| Other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| You know, I just don't want to hurt the nonprofits during the summer months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| I don't care to go back and tweak it and even tweak the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| I don't have a problem with any of that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| But I'd like to, you know, not hurt our nonprofits during the summer months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| I actually didn't want to stare my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| But, you know, to me it's ---- I guess I'll turn to Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| Is this nonprofit as established by state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| Mine, when this was brought to us, it has to do with the 50C3s, the churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| those type things, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| You know, I'm going to go back to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| I also think that, you know, someone selling potholders or whatnot is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| I think these dollars are a little bit excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| But I guess what I'm hearing is as long as this ordinance is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6946)|
| 1:55:53| are nonprofits going to be exempt from that or they're spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| they're buying it today and they want until something passes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| Motion to approve is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=6966)|

| 1:56:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| Let me ask Chris something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| Or Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| On the sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| I read the paper and the mayor's quotes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| Is the goal here is to keep someone from thinking they're going to be cheated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| and so they take all of it before they leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| Am I misinterpreting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| Or I'm just looking at the private industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| and it's rare out there in the private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| Although I'm thinking back years ago with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| there was a lot of abuse, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| But just give me your point of view on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| Point of view, and I may let Mark Jones answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| He's kind of the guy who's spearheaded this campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| and it's really a positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| Basically, it's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| As far as I can remember, employees have always accrued sick leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| and it's always rolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| It's always rolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| And what happens is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| I'll use Mark Jones as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| Let's say Mark Jones thinks he's going to retire in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| He's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| But let's just say he's going to retire in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Then Mark Jones may start taking Monday and Tuesday off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| or Thursday and Friday off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| and then just to use that sick leave down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| So what the county is losing there is productivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7090)|
| 1:58:17| So that's four days that we don't have somebody in office to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| And so the mindset behind this was let's do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| One thing was let's keep the productivity of the county where it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| and by doing so we'll reward employees who are long tenured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7112)|
| 1:58:38| and who can retire by giving them a lump sum, up to $10,000 upon retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7118)|
| 1:58:45| So it's kind of a win for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| It's a win for the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| And so, furthermore, it's revenue and expense neutral in the sense of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7132)|
| 1:59:00| We are a position-based budget as far as employees go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| And so as that long tenured employee leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| then you're going to replace them with somebody who isn't making as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| So you have savings there to cover not only their annual payout but their sick payout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| Furthermore, you can never spend more in that position in a year that's budgeted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7157)|
| 1:59:23| So you may take another week or two to hire somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| So it's really not costing anything in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| So you're avoiding having a staffing problem those last few weeks or months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| and the employee doesn't feel cheated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| I mean, again, you agree with me that in the private industry it's rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| I mean, I don't think that it is unfair to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| And, actually, I would like to hear what Mark Jones had to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| because he's kind of spearheaded this thing and I'll let him speak to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7194)|
| 2:00:02| Mark Jones, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| I don't know what I can say anymore than what Chris just said to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| It sounded exactly kind of what the objectives of the county has been in looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| And, again, trying to save taxpayer money by giving employees incentive not to use their accumulated sick leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7214)|
| 2:00:23| not just during the last year, but to build it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| Because it takes quite a while to build up 800 hours of sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| And if the individual walks out the door with a $10,000 W-2 wage amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| he's going to, he or she is actually going to wind up with seven or something, aren't they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| because of internal revenue and FICA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| And I assume that person was probably one of those who was getting a 12% match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| so they would put 6% and 12% so to get 18%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| Would that be accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| More than likely they'd get the 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| Yeah, and I would say this, and Jones, he may actually have some figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| but most employees don't have that much accrued sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| I mean, I guess the average, I don't know what the average really is, but it's not going to be close to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| If you look at all the employees we've got right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| and you look at basically it's with employees between 10 and 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| only about 11% have even 800 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| So the number is not quite as large as you would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| And, again, the incentive is for employees to save the sick leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| and only use it when they're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| I'm not saying that, you know, I don't know what the statistics are for people who abuse it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| but, you know, we know that that does occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| I just wanted to hear your point of view on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| You did a good job last week, but I heard some complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| and I think we've got some e-mails just in this morning since the newspaper story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| but I appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| Mr. Jones, in mention of the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| how does the private sector incentivize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| or avoid the problem of sick leave like we would anticipate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| You know, I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| I do know that a lot of private employers, they don't really have sick and annual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| They just have one a certain amount of time that's allowed off per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| such as like 15 paid leave days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| I know some companies do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| And it's probably not cumulative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| So yearly, it goes away at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| It goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| It's used or it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| I was going to chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| He's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| I mean, you know, sick leave is a nice benefit that I think is dying in the private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7369)|
| 2:02:57| And that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| And I think when we're trying to compare the private to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| we have to keep in mind that the same employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| in the private sector is making $15,000 or $20,000 more than a public employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| I mean, so, I mean, there's a reason employees who are well qualified work for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7394)|
| 2:03:21| And part of that would be benefits such as health insurance and sick time and vacation time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7401)|
| 2:03:29| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| Ed, going back to what you were saying, and I read the article this morning in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7412)|
| 2:03:37| but Mark, the way I did my math and looked at the $10,000 and how much time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| it comes out to $12.50 per hour is what we would be paying those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| And I'm assuming most of those people, by the time they've got that kind of time built up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| they're usually making more money than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| So I'm thinking, Chris, that's where it's savings to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| Well, Jennifer Ward, who is with me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| she's very good about helping me look at running some of the statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7441)|
| 2:04:06| And I believe I can tell you this, that the county would actually save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| based on the analysis that Chris talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| When an employee retires, they usually retire at a higher step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| When you go back to step one, when you look at the average time that the job is left open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7461)|
| 2:04:27| which is usually a month, when you figure all that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| I'm almost sure I can show you that the county would save money in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| depending on the number of employees that take advantage of this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| in the next year or the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| I took the example that was in the paper this morning, just divided it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| It came out to $12.50 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| I thought, well, most of them are probably making more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| so it should be a savings to us, if that Dinella guy's got his figures right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| The other thing for you to know is we've done kind of a baseline so that we can look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7494)|
| 2:05:01| in a year or two years, if you want to ask questions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| I believe I can tell you whether or not it is going to save the county money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| or whether it's kind of where it is and whether it's how it looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| Thank you, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| Mr. Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| Yeah, I was just going to point out, working in a private sector, a lot of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| they don't accumulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| They buy back their sick time, what's left from their employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| and it's capped at like $1,000 a year or whatever the company sets up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| So this would be just cashed out when they retire, whatever they've got left, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7534)|
| 2:05:41| It's only retirement, and it's what the definition of the retirement board has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| It's only at retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| Even in the private sector, it saves them money because the cost of them actually taking a sick day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| and you have to find replacements, it actually costs the companies more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| than if they just paid them the $1,000 at the end of the year for whatever unused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| So I think it's a good program and kind of gives them a little something extra to go out on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7565)|
| 2:06:14| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| Well, I'm going to take a minority opinion on this, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| because I have been in the private sector as an employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| And I can tell you, we've had one little old lady that worked for us for 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| that started taking off some Mondays and Fridays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| and she was told you're either going to come to work or you're not going to have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| And that's how the private side works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| And we're talking about when people are taking off Mondays and Fridays when they're not sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| you're talking about them basically defrauding the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| I don't care how you put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| And that's, you know, I mean, I just don't think that's done in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7604)|
| 2:06:49| You look at all these little mom-and-pop businesses that are out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| the people working at clerks in these stores and the people that have businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| I can tell you, if you have people that aren't showing up from work, they lose their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7616)|
| 2:07:01| If they're just not sick and they don't want to come in because it's a nice day to go fishing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| it's not going to last very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| We have a motion before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| I've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7642)|
| 2:07:36| We're on page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| Under other business, spread of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| the required report on debt obligation form filed with the State of Tennessee regarding the capital leasing transaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7660)|
| 2:07:47| with SunTrust Bank in the amount of $13,182,024| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| for the purpose of acquiring energy management equipment for the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| Approved by Resolution 13-3-201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| Okay. Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| I don't think we need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| Spread of record, the apology from Commissioner Jeff Owenby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| to his family, friends, constituents, and county commission for his behavior on May 24, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7690)|
| 2:08:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| The censure of Commissioner Jeff Owenby for his actions on May 24, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7699)|
| 2:08:26| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| Okay. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| You know, I'm actually glad that this is, you know, that we're putting this behind us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7714)|
| 2:08:42| But I was a little disturbed last week in that while I don't agree with the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7722)|
| 2:08:51| I think we, you know, we kind of get paid the pennies we get paid to make the tough decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7731)|
| 2:08:59| and we're elected to make the tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| What's really concerning me is the vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| This is an unfortunate situation, but this is something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| if we're going to be held accountable to our constituents, to this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7753)|
| 2:09:20| this is something that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| This isn't a, you know, this isn't an issue of like or dislike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7762)|
| 2:09:30| This is an issue of right or wrong, and we've gone through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| I think that the case has been resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| but to vote no and have our chairman vote no on this is very disturbing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7777)|
| 2:09:45| I think this is something that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7785)|
| 2:09:50| This is a minimum set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| We could have done a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| Glad we didn't, but we could have done a lot more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| talking and wrangling and dragging this through, whatever, but we haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7797)|
| 2:10:02| We've kind of dealt with this, done a spreader record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| We hadn't read anything publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| We hadn't done any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7808)|
| 2:10:09| But to vote no on this particular issue, quite honest, I think it's a disservice to everyone, everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7809)|
| 2:10:21| So this is a minor step, but it's a necessary step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| And I commend Commissioner Hammond for bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| And I just, like I said, that just really disturbed me last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| and just wanted to make sure that I got that on public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7843)|
| 2:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| I guess there's a couple of reasons I should express for my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7850)|
| 2:11:00| And at the ‑‑ I'm just trying to phrase this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7860)|
| 2:11:12| The more this gets talked about, the more damaging I think it is to Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| And so what I view as someone who has withstood a public lashing, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7879)|
| 2:11:30| for over a year for basically a private indiscretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7890)|
| 2:11:40| but he's publicly humiliated and his family for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| I just think enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| And I admire his courage for staying here, for coming to meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7909)|
| 2:11:57| and to withstand this barrage of repeated assaults on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7917)|
| 2:12:05| If my own sexual sins and indiscretions were displayed for everybody to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7925)|
| 2:12:14| I don't think I could have withstood it like Mr. Owenby has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7934)|
| 2:12:20| And then if I combine that kind of what I think just over the top treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7940)|
| 2:12:31| of an individual with the circumstances that surrounded the event a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7951)|
| 2:12:38| which calls into question a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| There's a lot of circumstances that went around this at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| And I do not think there are coincidences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| I do not have accusations towards anybody involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| But there's a lot of questions about how this took place, when it took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| and it made me very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| And I think Mr. Owenby has suffered enough, and therefore I will be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7982)|
| 2:13:13| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7993)|
| 2:13:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8003)|
| 2:13:31| One passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| One passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8012)|
| 2:13:43| Commissioner Hammond added a discussion item regarding the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| We received a memo from our law department a few days ago, maybe a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| with regards to the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| And we canceled an education meeting as a result of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| And so it prompted me to start looking at, okay, are we abiding by the Sunshine Law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| Because those of us who have been through the Sunshine Law are very keenly aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| of the ramifications of any possible violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| I think that we've done a very good job over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| We've had no one come and challenge the fact that we have not done our business properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| I think that we are probably the most transparent county commission in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| And so I don't think that we have done anything wrong at all, but things do change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| After I got the memo, I contacted the Open Records Council in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8073)|
| 2:14:39| just to kind of get a sense for what other people are doing and what their suggestions might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| The Open Records attorney told me that under the mosque case in Murfreesboro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8085)|
| 2:14:54| the Murfreesboro City Council apparently was considering the building of a mosque,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| and they had had some hearings and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| and they had some lawsuits filed against them with regards to open meetings violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8101)|
| 2:15:09| She said that the judge in that case ruled that merely sending out a press release to the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8109)|
| 2:15:17| merely putting it on your website, et cetera, was not enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| that there had to be an ad paid for and taken out in the local media publications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8122)|
| 2:15:30| I guess of daily record or weekly record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| Now, she did tell me that there is case law on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| that it could be argued that you don't have to take out an ad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| that if you follow the state law and whatnot, you're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| Then there is also this law now from this judge in Murfreesboro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| which has not gone to the Supreme Court, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| but you do have this judge who has said you have to take out an ad for your committee meetings and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8151)|
| 2:15:58| If you have regularly scheduled meetings like this commission meeting, you don't have to take out ads for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| But if you're having a committee meeting, you should do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| I asked our finance department how much money we've spent on newspaper ads in Knox County over the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| and Chris Caldwell told me that the bill to date over the last two years is $165,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8172)|
| 2:16:21| Now, that's monies for the new Sentinel, for the Knoxville Focus, for the Farragut Press, and for the Hall Shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| So that's a combined, and again, that's two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| So we're spending a lot of money on ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| Now, I guess the question that I have, and the reason I bring this up for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| is because I want us to continue to be the most transparent body in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| that there's no questions and that there's no issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| So I bring this up for consideration because her advice to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8205)|
| 2:16:49| I'm talking about the legal counsel with the open records law, said revisit this, and if you need to tweak it, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8209)|
| 2:16:56| If you don't need to tweak it, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| But she said just be aware that there is case law, but you could argue either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| So I just bring it up for discussion to see, are we okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| Do we need to start taking out ads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| If we do, then we're going to have to look at, you know, a cost for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8229)|
| 2:17:15| I even ask about, you know, like Commissioner Boyle, she usually has meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| and we have like a 48-hour notice on that, and we send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| Do we have to take out an ad for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| And so, anyway, she was noncommittal, but she said there's case law on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| So I guess, Mr. Law Director, I'm looking to you to say, what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| Do we need to take out an ad to protect ourselves given this ruling from this judge in Murfreesboro in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8254)|
| 2:17:40| or are we okay and we don't have to take out ads and let's just wait and see what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| So the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| The real issue at hand is the word public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8272)|
| 2:17:58| And we were working on some legislation to be able to do it on the Internet, believe it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8278)|
| 2:18:06| when the Knoxville delegation worked on another piece of legislation to let the media put it on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8286)|
| 2:18:16| So the real issue of what we at the law department looked at was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| If we have a legislatively created date, meaning like county commission meetings or where they are, when they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8301)|
| 2:18:29| the public is on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| So we don't have to put money out for the regularly scheduled county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8312)|
| 2:18:38| When we put together special meetings, committee meetings, called meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8318)|
| 2:18:44| the sending out a notice to the Knoxville News Sentinel notifies the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8324)|
| 2:18:52| But they are under no obligation to, quote, notify the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| And so out of an abundance of caution, I think we, Knox County, to be transparent, should notify the public, meaning by an ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8336)|
| 2:19:08| That's if the meeting is going to be advisory back to this body or contain some elements or opportunities of deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8348)|
| 2:19:17| Now, there are some exceptions where the general information rule, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8357)|
| 2:19:25| if you're going to go on a tour of a building and you're just gaining information that you're going to come back and talk about later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8365)|
| 2:19:33| it's going to be on an agenda later, you're going to notify the public about it later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8373)|
| 2:19:37| or it's going to be in a regular county commission later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| That one doesn't necessarily have to be put in a paper of general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8381)|
| 2:19:47| So the real rule is almost community specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| And what gives us heartburn is Murfreesboro is not a Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| But that judge was very clear to let Murfreesboro know what they had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8397)|
| 2:20:02| We can't hang one on the courthouse door like some small communities really could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8402)|
| 2:20:09| Where the regular post office is in some real rural communities, everybody goes in there, you know, once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8409)|
| 2:20:16| They've got their board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| They've got a little Internet thing they put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| The public could be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| So it's on a real factual driven basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| And looking at Knox County as one of the big four, if you will, versus Murfreesboro, we believe it would be prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8425)|
| 2:20:34| Any time there is a deliberative body or an advisory to the deliberative body, we should have a public notice of general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8434)|
| 2:20:44| And that would be our advice to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| So any regularly scheduled meeting would not need to take an ad, for example, these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| But like the education committee or if there's a committee of the audit committee, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8452)|
| 2:20:58| any of those committees' ads would need to be taken out to notice the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8458)|
| 2:21:04| Where it came to our attention, truthfully, was we've been, meaning the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| has been handling the ethics committee for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| And we've just been summarily doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| And, you know, in our mind, it's just we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| And then we realized we weren't doing it, I guess is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| And that's where the advice came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| So the ethics committee, the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| any time the public has a right to know that deliberation or advisory action is being taken that will come before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8489)|
| 2:21:38| then they should have a right to be publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| And from Knoxville's standpoint, as big a community as we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| we don't have a bulletin board we can hang it on and make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| And my personal opinion, this is not a legal opinion, I like the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8511)|
| 2:21:58| And I'm not so sure that we don't have a lot more people with Internet than we do newspapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| But that's something to look at in a future day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| I think right now where we are under the state statute, it's a paper of general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8525)|
| 2:22:11| And I think for public notice to be legalized, it's a paper of general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| So, as you mentioned, the legislature would need to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8537)|
| 2:22:23| And so maybe that's something we can look at for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| But now what about if two commissioners want to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| We've had a 48-hour notice that we've sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| Does this mean an add, five-day notice and an add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| Well, I think we've always used the 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8557)|
| 2:22:41| The other standard that you look at, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| is what is the normal procedure and expectation of the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| And we've had a five-day notice for committees and boards of which commissioners are a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| And that's where the five-day notice comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| The 48-hour notice has been the normal practice for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| When two or more commissioners are going to meet, like your Commissioner Broll's, I forgot the tea company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8582)|
| 2:23:13| Time Warp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| Time Warp Tea Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8594)|
| 2:23:15| I couldn't think of the Time Warp part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| That's really on the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| Number one, you're supposed to take minutes from that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| You're supposed to have any votes that are taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| You're supposed to have records kept and they're supposed to be turned in and made public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| So we have a lot of issues, meaning the law department has a lot of issues with those meetings anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| I can look at it in more depth and come back on the 48-hour rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| That's what I was going to suggest is I don't want to give the public the impression we've been doing anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| We haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| I mean, this is just something that's come up out of Murfreesboro that we have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| I'm asking for you to look at that and report back to us and give us your recommendations on how we need to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| and then we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| There's no intent to say in our advice that Knox County has ever done anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| It's that, as we know, the rules change, and some of the rules have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| and we're just putting us on notice that they're changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8653)|
| 2:24:19| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| Let me up on this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| Take the Knox when you sent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| Three, four, five, six, seven out of 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8671)|
| 2:24:41| You know, I'm counting behind two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| As you alluded to a while ago, Mr. Law Director, there's not as many people reading the papers as there is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| If we, as there used to be, if we tried to address every single outlet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8692)|
| 2:24:58| that $186,000 would probably be $586,000 a year, which is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8698)|
| 2:25:08| The folks elected this body to serve them in each of their districts as their commissioner or commissioner-at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8708)|
| 2:25:17| They put the confidence of their voters, put their confidence in that commissioner to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8717)|
| 2:25:26| I know it's not always been so, but as Commissioner Hammond pointed out a while ago, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8726)|
| 2:25:32| for the last five years we've got a pretty good record to say that there's something coming up at, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8732)|
| 2:25:42| a school board meeting we know is going to be in a week, you know, ten days out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| And I'd like to sit down with Tony and discuss something because I want to go talk to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| By the time I get a notice out and an ad in the paper, the school board meeting's done been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| and we haven't had a chance to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| So it's putting a huge crimp in our ability to do the job we've been elected to by our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8764)|
| 2:26:15| And I think it's crazy, stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| If you be judicious in your meeting setups and in your discussions and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8778)|
| 2:26:25| and if you want to take minutes of it to prove what you did, that's all, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| you can prove if you didn't send out any notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| If you can prove that you took minutes and there's nothing transpired, there's nothing they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8794)|
| 2:26:45| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| Yeah, I wanted just to make a comment and thank, you know, Bud for his advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8806)|
| 2:26:52| but just to remind this board that the legal advice that we're getting from our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8812)|
| 2:26:59| is what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| He's given us the ironclad way where we'll never be challenged on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| And I appreciate that because that's your job, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| The thing is, is that every community has their community standard on the way the announcements have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8828)|
| 2:27:16| And just as the law director pointed out, in a little small town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| it may be something posted on a community bulletin board in front of the post office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| and someplace else it may be the town crier, and someplace else it may be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8844)|
| 2:27:30| But it seems to me that in Knoxville right now is that the system we're using with the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| the way we're making our community announcements is our community standard, and it's working pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8856)|
| 2:27:43| And I'm not certain that spending several hundred thousand dollars a year just to put an ad in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| quite frankly, I get the newspaper, but I tell you, I don't read all those little notices, is really well-spent taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8871)|
| 2:28:00| And it's just like when we get on our cars and go out on the highway, there's certain risks that we take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8880)|
| 2:28:06| but we're willing to accept certain risks if we do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8886)|
| 2:28:10| If we put on our seatbelts, we don't drive too fast and be sure that there's the right amount of air pressure in the tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| And it's sort of like this, is that at least for the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8895)|
| 2:28:20| we've not had anyone challenge what we do as far as the way we've noticed our meetings with us announcing them on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8900)|
| 2:28:27| And I think that is our community standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| Is there a risk that someone might challenge that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| I guess they could, but this may be a risk that we're willing to take for what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8913)|
| 2:28:39| And I don't disagree with anything with what the law director has said, but at least in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8919)|
| 2:28:45| the standard that we're using to announce our meetings and to announce meetings between commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8925)|
| 2:28:51| and committee meetings and all has worked and there's not been a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| And I think that even if someone did challenge it and we did have to go to court over something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8936)|
| 2:29:03| if we can say we've got a five-, a six-, or a seven-year community record and this is how we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8943)|
| 2:29:08| then that would, at least for our community, would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8948)|
| 2:29:15| withstand a challenge on what the community standard is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| And that's my feeling about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| I just don't feel like spending a whole lot of money for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| That would be our norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| Yeah, this is our community standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| Okay, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8970)|
| 2:29:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8971)|
| 2:29:32| I think that as I've listened to what's taking place, I see us mixing apples and oranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8972)|
| 2:29:39| because the in-circulation paper notice is for deliberation of the body or the subunit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8979)|
| 2:29:48| which may be deliberating on behalf of the overriding unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8988)|
| 2:29:53| Even Commissioner Brown, in his choice of words, used the word discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=8993)|
| 2:30:03| When two commissioners get together at the time warp to discuss what might be on next week's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9003)|
| 2:30:11| that's a discussion and that's a very precise terminology used by Chancellor Fancher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| when he described the commission of old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| that the commission of old did not know the difference between deliberation and discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9021)|
| 2:30:30| like city council does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9030)|
| 2:30:34| And he may have named someone else that knows the difference between discussion and deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| But because old commission didn't know how to deliberate in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| he placed us under a higher threshold, I guess you'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| and we have to notice our discussions by 48 hours in the procedure that we're doing it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9051)|
| 2:31:01| So I believe that saying two commissioners get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| well, it could be under two different sets of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9066)|
| 2:31:10| One might need that published in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9070)|
| 2:31:16| and the other one needs to be a notice of 48 hours saying there's going to be a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9076)|
| 2:31:23| because I believe that's the way we're worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| So I don't know that we're too far off base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| It's just that the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| and subsequently the Board of Education member asking the question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9090)|
| 2:31:36| has this particular kind of meeting been properly noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| and under the letter of the law it had not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| That doesn't mean we throw out all the other meetings that we're currently having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9104)|
| 2:31:49| Was that a discussion or a deliberation meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9109)|
| 2:31:57| Was that rhetorical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| That was rhetorical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9118)|
| 2:32:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| Anything else here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9125)|
| 2:32:06| The next discussion item is operations of the trustee's office during Mike Lowe's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9126)|
| 2:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9134)|
| 2:32:15| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| I don't know if you saw the article in the newspaper last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| I hope you did, because it was very telling with regards to the ghost employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9139)|
| 2:32:26| And one ghost employee is alleged, I use the word alleged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| to have bilked Knox County out of approximately $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| There is another employee that is alleged to have been a ghost employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9155)|
| 2:32:40| that we don't have any figures on yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| But as we get the figures, it's going to be probably close to the same range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| probably over six figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| And then there's another aspect of this that I have been talking with Mr. Armstrong about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9169)|
| 2:32:55| and that is Mr. Hahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9175)|
| 2:32:58| Mr. Hahn has admitted that he took money from Knox County in the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9178)|
| 2:33:05| and that figure is over six figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9185)|
| 2:33:10| To date, and this happened in 2008, five years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9190)|
| 2:33:15| I don't believe that a single penny has been paid back to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9195)|
| 2:33:22| either from Mr. Hahn or any of these other activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9202)|
| 2:33:26| This really, really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| And it bothers me on several levels, because if we were in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9209)|
| 2:33:34| and someone bilked a company out of $200,000, $100,000, $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| it would not take five years to prosecute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| It would not take five years to get the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| I mean, there would be action taken to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| But for some reason, five years later, we're still waiting to see how we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9227)|
| 2:33:54| Now, I know that there are extenuating circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| but I just wanted to go on record as saying that I hope that the public is keeping close watch on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9237)|
| 2:34:05| I'm going to be asking the audit committee to take a look at how we can prevent this kind of thing from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9245)|
| 2:34:13| Yes, investigations are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| I've been privy to a little bit of that investigation over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| But it just really, really bothers me that not one penny has been paid back to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9259)|
| 2:34:26| and here we are five years later, and nobody's in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9266)|
| 2:34:30| And so I'm not really interested in any action right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| except to say that I just wanted to go on record as saying that this bothers me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| I hope it bothers our constituents, and I hope that we can get a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| because now I read that trials are not set until 2014, which will be six years afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9281)|
| 2:34:50| So, you know, when you look at it, it just really, really, really angers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9290)|
| 2:35:01| And so I appreciate the opportunity to make my statements public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| and I want to say that Mr. Armstrong is working on getting our money from Mr. Hahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| He has a plan, and he's going to be executing that plan, and hopefully we can get our money back in due time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| But when these organizations come before us and the rescue squad needs money for equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9313)|
| 2:35:18| and we need computers for our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| but yet there's people out there that have bilked us out of hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| and nothing's been paid back yet, it really makes my blood boil a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| So, thank you, Mr. Armstrong, and I know that you'll report back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| when it's appropriate for you to do that about how we're going to go about getting that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9333)|
| 2:35:37| But I just wanted to go on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| And, again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9338)|
| 2:35:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| Do we need to hear from the Attorney General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| Do we need to hear a report from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| I know he probably can't say anything about ongoing investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9348)|
| 2:35:52| Bud should be privy to that information as much as they can put out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| Bud, I'm like Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9356)|
| 2:35:59| I mean, we've been hearing this and hearing it and nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9359)|
| 2:36:02| I'd like for somebody to report to us about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9362)|
| 2:36:09| It's an ongoing investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| The next discussion item is regarding firearms in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9376)|
| 2:36:22| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9383)|
| 2:36:24| Everyone should have had their, apparently, because I have received one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| a full-page document making complaint of accusation of illegal discharge of a weapon in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9389)|
| 2:36:43| Automatic weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| And I have spoke to this individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| and have tried to express my concern that as a policymaking person in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9412)|
| 2:36:59| just as we are all seated as policymakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| the illegal discharge of a weapon is something that I really can't take as a report to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9425)|
| 2:37:13| and have asked that he make sure that the proper law enforcement people be notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9433)|
| 2:37:22| and for the purpose of having, then, the correct legal activity take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9442)|
| 2:37:31| Not the legal activity of the sheriff investigating through his resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| Now, then, other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| I do not know of anything that we can do as a seated legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9460)|
| 2:37:47| to address any of the concerns this person is presenting to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9467)|
| 2:37:53| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| That's just strictly my feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| Mr. Law Director, would you sort of point me now in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9477)|
| 2:38:03| or am I headed in the right direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| Well, Commission, this particular information that you got today is not the first one we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9487)|
| 2:38:15| even this summer, not even this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| The law department looked into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9500)|
| 2:38:23| and County Commission's hands are pretty well tied when it comes to regulation of firearms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9503)|
| 2:38:27| outside county property, county parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| And even at that, it is only whether you can have one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9510)|
| 2:38:35| And we have our ordinances that are designed to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| which this body, I believe, actually voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| whether you have permitted guns or not in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9522)|
| 2:38:46| This falls under and is very specific with the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9526)|
| 2:38:51| that we have, we meaning Knox County, has no subject matter jurisdiction or, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| it's none of our business to regulate firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9537)|
| 2:39:01| It is a state activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| I have talked to Senator McNally about this very issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| and he has looked with his lawyers in Nashville and agrees with our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9551)|
| 2:39:17| And I think the state legislature may be coming down with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| I can't speak for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9561)|
| 2:39:22| This is way ahead of the curve because we're just now talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9562)|
| 2:39:27| and we don't go into session until January and, you know, how all that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9567)|
| 2:39:31| But I know that the state, that some of the Knoxville delegation are currently looking at what may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9571)|
| 2:39:36| or may not be done in terms of firearm regulations in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9576)|
| 2:39:41| If you did not enact a firearm regulation, I think it's prior to April the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| I don't remember the exact date on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| Ninety-six or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| Do you remember, David, what the date on that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| Ninety-eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| Ninety-eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9595)|
| 2:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9596)|
| 2:39:57| Then those acts were grandfathered in, meaning the city has some regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9597)|
| 2:40:04| but that's because they had them before the state limited the power of local government in firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9604)|
| 2:40:10| The county did not have any legislation in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| Therefore, we have no legislation in place and no power to put legislation in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9613)|
| 2:40:20| So to best answer your question, Commissioner Wright, we're working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9620)|
| 2:40:26| but there's not much I can do about it between now and probably this time next year when the legislature has met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9626)|
| 2:40:34| And I'm not sure what their design is going to be, but I do know that Senator McNally is looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9634)|
| 2:40:43| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| Isn't this one of those great times where having a charter form of government gives us some latitude with regard to setting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9645)|
| 2:40:58| Not in this case because it's statutory explicit that says we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9658)|
| 2:41:04| I mean, the statute supersedes the charter, and it's real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9664)|
| 2:41:10| I mean, there's not much interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| Even when I talked to the senator, he was surprised, you know, that, oh, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9673)|
| 2:41:17| And so I gave him the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| He got with his lawyers and communicated back and said, yeah, you're right, we probably need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| So that's kind of where we are, truthfully, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9685)|
| 2:41:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9689)|
| 2:41:30| You know, it's just when I read letters like this and listen to these e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| I tend to believe folks are doing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| And I would just hate to own some property where I got a nut sitting here with a fully automatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| thinking that he or she can fire into a bale of hay or around a bale of hay and everything's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9704)|
| 2:41:50| So that's just I really hate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9710)|
| 2:41:55| You know, proud gun owner, but we've got to be responsible with these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9715)|
| 2:42:00| And, you know, that whole adage, you know, you're right, stop, at the tip of someone else's nose, tends to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9720)|
| 2:42:09| And this just bothers me that, you know, people can save and scrap and earned and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9729)|
| 2:42:16| got their deposit down and bought their homes and thinking they're going out to the county, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9736)|
| 2:42:21| to this nice rural setting and they're dealing with this just bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9741)|
