| 0:04:29| I don't have my reading glasses with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| Name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| Daniel Sanders, Knox County Law Director's Office, 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| Do I have any questions for Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| Does this in no way will inhibit anybody's ability to use their land that's not in the rural preservation zone, neighboring properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| I do not believe so, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| What type of activities will it allow that you could not do currently under agricultural zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| None that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| It doesn't permit anything in addition to what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| Daniel, can you speak into the microphone closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| I don't believe it permits anything in addition to what the agricultural zone already permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| Just perhaps on smaller tracts of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| No, I don't believe there's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| There's no difference in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Well, there are some provisions that are different from the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| In fact, there's a restriction on property that will prohibit smaller divisions of property, smaller subdivisions of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=330)|
| 0:05:43| As far as dwellings and acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Right, and I can reference that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Under ag right now, you can go one acre, and this is five or 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Daniel, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Mr. Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| If the land is sold, if the person that buys that land wants to change it back to the original zoning, what's the process on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=361)|
| 0:06:10| You'll have to go to the Metropolitan Planning Commission, receive approval for rezoning or a recommendation for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| and then come back to the commission for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=379)|

| 0:06:58| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Commissioner Buston reminded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180220PublicHearing?start=420)|
