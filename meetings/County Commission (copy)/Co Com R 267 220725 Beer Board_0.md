| 0:15:19| On 5-24-2022 at approximately 1827 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| detectives with the Knox County Sheriff's Office organized retail crime unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| conducted an underage beer sale investigation in Knoxville business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| The arrestee was working the cash register when the underage person entered the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| The underage person showed their identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| and was able to purchase a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| The arrestee was misdemeanor cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| What was that last word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| The arrestee was misdemeanor cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Do you understand the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| And do you admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| It happened, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| And you can say anything else by further testimony to this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| I could sit here and tell you a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| We have a policy for selling alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| We have a zero tolerance for this type of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| We even do our own internal stings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| And when that happens, if there is a failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| and unfortunately there have been a couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| that person is terminated under our zero tolerance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| We have a big training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| I won't go into all the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| but every single day our employees are required to acknowledge a piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| sign it that they understand the law, what the ramifications of that law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| Anyway, in a big nutshell, we take it very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| And we have some procedures in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Just this employee, we hired on May 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| The offense was May 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| She was terminated May 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Employees are hard to find right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| Good employees are much harder to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| I'll turn it back over to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you, Director Boone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| First, I'd like to commend you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| You're nearly 30 years of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| This is your first offense, so it sounds like your policy is pretty effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| Would you like a 30-day suspension or a $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| Obviously the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| At this time, I'll open the floor up for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| One other thing, and I don't remember all the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| but we are a member of the Responsible Vendor Program in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| so I think there's some guidelines there that I'd like to have reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| From the Sheriff's Office, did you say in your testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| that the individual showed their driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1059)|
| 0:17:48| Or were asked to, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Yes, the underage person showed their identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Well, just to add to that, because I wrote myself some notes down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| most of our stores, we do require that our clerks scan the driver's license on the back of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| Of course, we get some pushback on that, because some people think we're sending it to the FBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| or something like that, but what it does is that it just identifies the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| and their date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| If this individual didn't do that, violation of company policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| or if she did do it and she punched in a wrong number, which can honestly happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| I don't want to indict her for that if she did it honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| But we do have things addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Vice Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| I don't have a motion yet, but I did want to say one thing to these gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| I know it's already been said, but I had a violation from a merchant in my district a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| and I think they've been in business about 60 years, and it was their first violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| So it's unfortunate whenever there is one, but I do want to commend you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| and it's also unfortunate that under the rules and procedures, we have to treat everybody the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| But I do commend you for the way you operate your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| I would like to make some motion for the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| I have a proper motion and a proper second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| The floor is open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1169)|

| 0:19:35| Can I also say something to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| I saw that length of service that you all did before you had your first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| and I think that's commendable that that offense happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| and I'm sorry that we have to do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| We operate 39 of these markets across East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| I shouldn't say what I'm about to say, but with that many opportunities to be back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| I hope I don't have to be back here, but you know what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-beer-board?start=1206)|
