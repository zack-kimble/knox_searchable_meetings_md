| 2:33:13| Right now, we've got some exciting research that's going on with the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9193)|
| 2:33:18| trying to take a different angle at it, looking at mosquitoes and the health problems that comes with trash on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9198)|
| 2:33:28| Maybe people will care about it differently if they hate mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| Mosquitoes harbor in trash, in standing liquid, so there's a lot to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9213)|
| 2:33:41| and it's exciting to work with Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9221)|
| 2:33:45| It's also his soapbox, and he can talk about it for a really long time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9225)|
| 2:33:52| Do you all have any questions for me or any observations from your years of service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9232)|
| 2:33:59| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9240)|
| 2:34:01| Thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| We're sorry that you had to wait so long to get to the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9243)|
| 2:34:08| but as the new director, if you were given the magic wand here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9248)|
| 2:34:15| what would you accomplish in the next five years when it comes to eutrophication and litter control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9255)|
| 2:34:21| Just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| It's really tough because I feel like the problems of trash and litter are a cultural problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9266)|
| 2:34:34| and it's really difficult to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9274)|
| 2:34:38| It's habits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9278)|
| 2:34:39| It's habits from everyone, and I don't believe everyone knows the effects of trash on our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9279)|
| 2:34:49| I would love to teach everyone about the harmful effects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| and I would love to work with legislation and laws because I feel like to make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9293)|
| 2:35:00| it needs to come from the top down sometimes to enforce these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9300)|
| 2:35:07| If I could have it my way, litter would be biodegradable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| and it would come from the packaging industry so that if it does fall to the ground, it would disintegrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| and I know that it doesn't just go away even though we don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| Plastics don't really break down like that, so I know I didn't really answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9321)|
| 2:35:27| but I believe it's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| I believe it's working with laws and corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| Any further questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| Thank you very much for the work you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| Thank you for making the time for me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| I feel really passionate about this, and thank you for your service to our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9347)|
| 2:35:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| Commissioners, I'm going to turn the floor over to Commissioner Busler who has some things to inform us of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| Well, first of all, for the schools board and members back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9359)|
| 2:36:04| this was just a discussion item for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| It had nothing to do to affect your all's funding or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| We just wanted to put this out to the commission because it will not affect this body until 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9372)|
| 2:36:20| but there's things you've got to do in between that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| Anyway, you all can leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| As soon as you walk out that door, I want to talk about you behind your back too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| But anyway, county commission, you all may have got this letter from the state about TISA funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9389)|
| 2:36:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| Have you all got this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| Have you got a letter from the governor's office and Penny Swinn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| the commissioner of education, and the funding and how TISA's going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| I think they sent it to every commissioner is the way they did it in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9414)|
| 2:36:58| If you've not looked at it, if you look at the figures about TISA in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9418)|
| 2:37:05| it's going to start by the funding's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9425)|
| 2:37:10| The state's going to take up a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| In fact, they're going to be putting in about $55 million more in the year 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9432)|
| 2:37:21| But the county's part that they were supposed to do, I guess, maintenance of effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| looks like it's going to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| That will be $17 million that will come back toward the county to be used for different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9450)|
| 2:37:39| that we can use, like for roads and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| But looking at this, you just can't take that money, $17 million, and re-budget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9463)|
| 2:37:52| Because most of the tax dollars that we give to the schools over and above what the maintenance of effort there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9472)|
| 2:38:00| is done on resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| So the resolution says that you're going to give this amount of money from the taxes that we put on liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9483)|
| 2:38:15| We have wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9495)|
| 2:38:18| And we've given so much money out of each one of those taxes under resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9498)|
| 2:38:24| And court litigation fee, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| I talked about that sometime, where that's $2 million a year that comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| But we give $1 million under resolution to the school board to pay on debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9512)|
| 2:38:40| But we've never have got from the school what they paid that debt on for the last nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9520)|
| 2:38:46| So that's about $9 million that has gone into the school to pay on debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9526)|
| 2:38:50| But we don't know what it goes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| But when we get to that point where that money says that we have this $17 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9532)|
| 2:38:58| it's $17 million, 17-3, that we would have to change the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9538)|
| 2:39:05| We'd have to make resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| If we do away with some of the tax revenue that we do on wheel tax, or we do it on liquor by the drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9547)|
| 2:39:13| or whatever that is where we get that tax, we'd have to pass a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9553)|
| 2:39:18| To do away with the resolution that gives them the money, we'd have to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| Because if we don't, they could demand that money because it's under resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9562)|
| 2:39:29| So I'm giving that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9569)|
| 2:39:30| You all have to deal with it in 2024 when that comes about and how you're going to get that money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| So I just thought I'd give you something to think about to see how you're going to look at the tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9575)|
| 2:39:40| where it's coming from, how you're going to make a resolution to get that money back in for maybe roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9580)|
| 2:39:47| parks, and other things like that for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| So anyway, that's why I wanted to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| If you have a chance to look at it, I'm having the state give me some information more about if TESA is really going to work or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9592)|
| 2:39:59| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| Is there any further business to come before this work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| Will the chairman of the committee motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9615)|
