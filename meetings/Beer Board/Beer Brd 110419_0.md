| 0:03:47| We're waiting on surrender of the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=227)|

| 0:04:14| The first one, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Falling down on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| The next several applicants are all we'll go ahead and pass these around or if you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=260)|
| 0:04:32| just do it at the end of the meeting, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| The next several applicants are Dollar General stores and I'm going to make a motion, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| I may, to hear these all together except 4640 Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=282)|
| 0:04:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| Questions on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Do you want to explain why you're doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| Just to save us a little time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| I'm glad to go through each and every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| It will be basically the same information with the exception of 4640 Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| And we do have a couple of exceptions that we'll get to that we'll need separate action on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| But I think this will help move us through the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| The only reason I ask the question is the managers are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| That doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| As long as the reports are the same, which essentially they will tell you the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| As we just get the record checks as we sit down, I'm flipping through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| And I noticed that the location at 3275 Sutherland Avenue has not completed the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| That was my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| They have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| They have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| They've all met the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| That was a concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| And just please be sure that everybody is comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| But, you know, it's just help us move through the agenda, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| All those in favor of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| So collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Do you want these read individually or grouped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| Well, I think there's two that there's some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| We are waiting on fire inspector's approval on three stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| The others have complete files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| And the stores would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Number 1050.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| In which location is that placed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| Isn't this fun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| I know this is a little out of the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| 1800 Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| 3275 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| And 9129 Executive Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| We're waiting on the fire inspector's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| The others have complete files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| So, Mr. Swanson, help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| I believe that we, because we're on the motion, we could approve all the ones with the exception of these three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| Frankly, the easiest thing to do is simply a motion to approve them all subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Final documentation with regard to all of those except the ones she named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| And so there wouldn't be any delay on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| I was wondering if we could maybe have one spokesman from Dollar General tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| About their program and their training and to make sure they don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| With youth and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| That's a great suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| If you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| My name is Leonard Davis and my address is 3240 Butterfly Hollow Road in Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| I'm the district manager for these stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| And you'd ask about our training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| In addition to the task class for our store managers, we have an in-store computer-based learning class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| that all of our associates are required to attend and complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| It's about a 30-minute training session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| And I actually have an overview of that if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| I can break it down into about four or five areas for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| You could do it briefly, but it would be helpful because you have about a half dozen or so applications here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| It's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| To start out, like I said, it's a 30-minute based computer-based learning class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| Each associate has to take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| That is tracked on a reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| And there's an exception-based reporting that we have on each week that's going to ensure that all of our associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| have been trained prior to us even setting any alcoholic beverages in our stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| The breakdown of that starts out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| We have a compliance section on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| The employees all must score 100% on all of the components of the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| Our course involves, we have certain goals of the course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| which is to encourage the sale of beer and wine in a legal and responsible manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| prevent sales to underage or intoxicated customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Customers may be buying for an underage person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| We do have a course content overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| We do have the electronic verification of ID there in the stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| which our registers will automatically prompt for ID and will not allow sales if it appears to be a bogus ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| So you've got sort of a check against the actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| And we also have restrictions set up in the registers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| which will not allow us to sell beer or wine during restricted time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| A couple of other points on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| The course involves topics such as sales to minors and age determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| It also talks to our managers about the liabilities of illegal sales and the consequences that that carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| It talks about legal and responsible management for each associate and managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| And, of course, then it has a key point to take away on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| And there are several bullet points down there, but for time's sake, I'll try to give you the highlights of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| So you are trying to have both training and institutional checkpoints to make sure you don't cross the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| We'll have the electronic piece, which is going to allow us to where we can check everything to prevent an accidental piece on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| And, of course, then we have the training piece to back that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| And what we've required all the associates to do is to go ahead and start that training prior to us even going through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| and at which point we were about 80% complete already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| So I'm kind of ahead of the gun, so to speak, on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| Let me go ahead and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| I never heard us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| You made the motion and I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| I never heard a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| I saw your light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| I was just going to say that I would like to request that you encourage Mr. Wilson to pay his unpaid fines that show up on this record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=663)|
| 0:11:13| Mr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| I'm trying to think of which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| It's Jordan Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| This would be McCullough Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Certainly we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| And if you would encourage him to pay those fines, we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| I will sure do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| What are the restricted times on the beer sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| I don't have that information here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| But what our office, what they do, they have a team dedicated to finding out any of those restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| so that before we actually even set any of that product in our stores, all that will be downloaded to our computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| I just don't have the details to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| But they will research that and have that information for us so that we will put that into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| I guess the officer has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=716)|

| 0:12:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=722)|

| 0:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Just another note that I would encourage you to really make sure that those folks at the Dollar General Store in Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| which is right across from West High School, be really diligent in checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=737)|

| 0:12:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| And then we have Dollar General Store number 4287 at 4640 Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| You're probably aware that there is some site problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| It's too close to a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| It shows 34 feet, actually, from a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| And that, I'm not exactly sure which district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| Is that the fourth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| It would take a, we would need to make a motion to deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=797)|

| 0:14:36| but obviously has asked to be withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=876)|

| 0:15:37| Why don't you, we're running a little ahead of schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Why don't you give us a rundown of your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| So we're going to call it a farm-to-table deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| So we're going to use local meats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| We have a farmer from 15 minutes down Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| We're getting cows in, and we're going to process the meat, corn it, grind it, make salami, pastrami, corned beef.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=954)|
| 0:16:02| We're also going to have pork products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| We're going to have ham, bacon, basically utilizing the whole animal and trying to incorporate the local community as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=964)|
| 0:16:14| We'll make our own pickles, our own bread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| So we're trying to do almost everything in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Catering, offsite catering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Yeah, that will be down the road, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Yes, just a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| That, of course, is the site of the old Harold's Deli, which is near and dear to a lot of Knoxvilleans' hearts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| and I wish you all the best and luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| A lot of people are really glad to see another deli coming into that space in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| So good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| We hope to honor the tradition that Harold had for so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1000)|

| 0:20:21| and we're going to be doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| We have grass-fed black Angus meat, and it's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| It's the new trend, and we have a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1228)|

| 0:23:08| Well, we're a comic book board game and collectible card game store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| As time has passed, you know, most people remember Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh! as kids' pastimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| We tend to deal a lot in older, more strategic board games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| specifically European imports that have become very popular among an older crowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| including, as far as the card games go, a game called Magic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| that now most of its participatory members are 21 to 30 and plus among that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| I have very few people actually under the age of 21 who come and patronize my store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| We've been open for about a year, a year and a half now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| And the idea is simply to, since I've had a great deal of demand from my customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| just a small-scale, you know, just canned bottled beer cooler in the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1443)|

| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| If you all remember that little exercise we had with the Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| I'll make a motion that we collectively hear all three of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1485)|

| 0:25:00| I don't guess I'm on my game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1508)|

| 0:25:14| I need to get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| Councilman DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Perhaps the gentleman can explain to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| It looks like from the cover sheets that you've changed your LLC type ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| and that's why you're reapplying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Can you just go into that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| We're the same company that owns Fleming's also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| It's just the restructuring there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Everything is still the same for us at the restaurant level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| You're already serving the beer at the locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| You're just technically a new owner because you've changed your business structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1552)|

| 0:26:05| We're waiting on fire inspector and building inspector approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| These are sprinkled through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| It looks like the second, the fifth and the fourth, so I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1575)|

| 0:26:39| Peter Kern, bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| We are just getting to it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Are we going to move this to the HEAL because we've got not in for processing on the record sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Well, they've got some sight problems, some distance problems as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| I'll make a motion we move them to the HEAL of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| All those in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| All right, we'll keep moving with Chuck Rawbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1621)|

| 0:27:17| Sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Well, you all will notice on this that there's, you'll probably notice on this that there's no sight listings here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1640)|
| 0:27:30| but I will remind you that this was the former NAMA location, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| So it is preexisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| So if there's any questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| And, Ms. Martin, I recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1658)|

| 0:27:54| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| I just wonder if the young lady would tell us, were you associated with NAMA and you're breaking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| or are you just a wholly new business coming into their spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| It's a new business underneath the NAMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Tell us a little bit about your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| It's going to be a Rawbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| I don't really know the menu yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| They're still in the works of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| They'll have wine and beer and basically a Rawbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Good luck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| It's been motioned, properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1707)|

| 0:28:53| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1733)|

| 0:29:13| There was a measurement issue for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Eighty-four feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| I would remind you that the former business side street tavern closed March 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| So it's preexisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| That was my question, but she's already answered it by saying there was a premise already approved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| I assume that the premise before that preceded the church location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| I don't have that detail, but it's previously approved for beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1786)|

| 0:30:02| What you going to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| It's a neighborhood tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| It's the kind of place where folks from the Bearden area and all different walks of life actually come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| and enjoy each other's company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| We're doing some things in there, putting some art on the walls from local artists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| going to have those for sale to help out the local art community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| and making it a non-smoking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| I don't believe the former business was, and so we're going to clean that up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| and hope to see some folks from the area come and see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1831)|

| 0:31:15| Is that one of their stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| It is one of their stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| We're taking over the stir-fry store over in Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| So it's already a pre-existing restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1881)|

| 0:31:29| And you've got sort of an Asian theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Yeah, it's Asian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| It's basically a P.F. Chang's, but just not quite as expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| It's really good food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1896)|

| 0:32:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Timothy Joseph, 4612 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| No record and the test class is complete on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Waiting on approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| And this would be in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I'll recognize counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| I was going to second and then ask this gentleman to tell us what happens at Waukee Chow, Fire Seared Asian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| Glad you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Simply, we are Chinese cuisine featuring Thai, Korean, mostly Chinese, but it's fast casual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| So there's no servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| There's no tipping required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Walk to a counter and get your food?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| You're going to order at the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| You're going to sit down with a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| We're going to cook your food fresh to order and then deliver the food to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| So you get your own beverages, but we're going to serve beer and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| My pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| It's a proper motion and second and seeing no, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Seeing no other lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| If you'll see me stay, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Anyone from next level come visiting us yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| This is in the third district, and I have received some phone calls and just prior to the council meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| an e-mail from the person who owns the zone sports site where these wrestling events would take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| And he says unequivocally they will not happen there, that they've applied for a state daycare license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| and they have children at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| And he had contracted with this individual to hold wrestling matches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| but there was no provision for beer, wine, any other kind of alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| So the owner of the property where this was to take place is quite adamant that it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| So I am thinking perhaps in the fact that the applicant has not been in for any kind of processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| that perhaps a motion to deny would be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| Are you from next level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| I am the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Hold on one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| So let's allow him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| If you'll identify yourself, name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| My name is Michael Mills, and it's 5331 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| And we are a Knoxville safe place for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| We're a runaway shelter for kids, and our whole thing is kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| And one of the other owners wanted to have a wrestling thing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| We've had wrestling there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| It's went off great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| We had Smoky Mountain Wrestling there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Didn't have any problem with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| They didn't have beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| They didn't have alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| It was a kid event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| It was awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| They did a lot of donations for the kids and children's hospital, so they did a lot of good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| This next level, I don't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| I just said no for the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| I got a notice saying that they were going to have beer at my facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| and DHS called me and said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| And also, we would lose our Knoxville safe place, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| because you can't be a safe place and have alcohol at a safe place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| What was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| The motion was to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| It's been motioned and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Is there further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| Seeing no other likes, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Thank you, guys, so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Did anyone come in from Peter Kern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| Peter Kern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Peter Kern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| I will make a motion that we postpone this or six districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2138)|
| 0:35:47| I'll second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Until May 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| The motion is seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2156)|

| 0:36:02| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| We'll be saving our copy of the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Give it to Wanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| And then the addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| We'll turn this over to Smarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| My favorite part of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Previously presented for your consideration, Jackson Avenue Market, 200 West Jackson Avenue, Unit 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| And I believe they are here to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| They're going to need additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| That's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Jackson Avenue Market, Matthew White and Hammer, 200 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| We would like 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| We're still waiting for construction to be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| We're still waiting for the construction to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| I would assume that's probably in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| We would move to extend it 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| Yes, move to extend 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| And that is to you have a date for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| I mean, June somewhere, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| Well, let's just say the June beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| It can be 60 days from today, but they'll need to bring it back before 60 days is up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| if they don't have the beer permit in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| So 60 days is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| We can calculate that if we have a calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Take your shoes off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| It's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| All those in favor of extension say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Just ripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| That applicant could not be here tonight, but they did e-mail us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| And there's a copy of the e-mail in your packet, and they would like an extension until the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| I must have missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| May 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| That's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| But she's already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Later documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Extension until May 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| There's a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| All those in favor of the extension until May 17th say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| Landron Palace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2300)|
| 0:38:29| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Francis Delarocho, 11167 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| Tell us what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Apparently they keep running into some construction issues with the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| Primarily the ventilation part of the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| I think the ventilation goes from the actual restaurant, which is kind of outside the mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| all the way through the mall to their air conditioning system, which is in a whole separate part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| So that was primarily the reason for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| So what's your pleasure here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110419?start=2346)|
