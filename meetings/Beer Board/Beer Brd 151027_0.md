| 0:05:59| The people listed on the application who need the task class are Ralph Gale Honeycutt, Julie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| L. Honeycutt, and Adrian Knight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| So they need to get the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Yes, Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Only one of those three need to actually attend the class, but all three need to make an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| and come in for the fingerprints and background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| We need building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and the permit from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Do we need to postpone this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Well, that has been our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| So do I hear someone has some conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| Mr. Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| I guess, Ms. Hanbright, when would you need your permit by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| We'd like to have it by November 6th, which I'm beginning to understand might be impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| We've been really busy, as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| We've moved a business over across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| It's almost been impossible to even keep the businesses going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| So just tell me what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| I'm goal-oriented, and we will get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| I think now is the time to change our policy and approve these pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| That's what we used to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| You know, it just causes, I think, these businesses headaches that they have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| They're not going to get their permit until they complete everything that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| So I'd move to approve the pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| I'd like to oppose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Councilman de la Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| I'd like to oppose that, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| It seems to me that the fingerprint background check is an important part of making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| we have a responsible party getting a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| And we don't need to be putting the fires out later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| We want to make sure that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Councilman de la Vope, may I just interject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| I'm sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| And I know you all are busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Let him finish, and then I'll recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| It's one of the tools we have to make sure that we have responsible parties in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| And I think we should observe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| Now, whether we can have an earlier meeting or something, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| But I don't think we should forego this action at this point in time in terms of deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=490)|
| 0:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| May I respond to that just for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| And I'm sorry to interrupt earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| I've had a background check three times, I think, in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| Yeah, but there's these other three folks that are on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| It's Gail Honeycutt, Julie Honeycutt, and Adrienne Knight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Adrienne Knight is with Trio Cafe as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| And I know she has a current task class certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| And I know she's been background checked as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| As far as Gail and Julie, we can get that done ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Any consideration would be very much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| This puts the spearboard in between a rock and a hard place, I think, is the best way to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| We have a policy for many years, as Councilman Starr pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| we would approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| That became an issue because it's really important that the people have the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| and that the records checks be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| And so that was something the applicant could control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| You can't always control when the fire inspector is going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| the health department, or those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Sure, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| But those are things that you can control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| So as a spearboard, we did decide that we would do no more approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| pending final documentation if the task class or the records checks were not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Now Councilman Starr has made the motion that we rethink that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| Do you want to restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| I mean, it just seems that we keep putting ourselves in a bind with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| There's no beer permit that's walking out the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| unless they do everything that's required on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| And so then we have to have special meetings and do it before Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| We don't have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| It would come up at the November 24th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| But in the past, over the last few years, we have had to have special meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| Now has this prevented any underage sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| To me, I just do not see the connection at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| So it puts us in a hard spot every time we have somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| that would like a business that we want to be successful in the heart of Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| that would like to be able to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| from what the manager says, start selling beer November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| If they can get the task background checked by November 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| and all their documents in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| I just don't see a reason why we wouldn't vote to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| They're not going to get a permit unless they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| do the things that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| So I just think the policy we adopted a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| to force that, it keeps putting us in this bind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| And I don't like it, and I look around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| I don't think anybody else really likes it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| So that's why I moved to approve it pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| We revisited this policy within the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| and as a group agreed, there were nine of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| and as the majority agreed that we would have this policy in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| to have the task class completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| because that's something that the applicants can control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| The records and background check is something that they can control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| And that was the reason we went to that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| because if I remember the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| it was for them to show that they have good faith about following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| So that was why we went to the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Right, and I don't ever remember supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| I remember the majority supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| They have not supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| And I can see that logic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| that that is their responsibility to do these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| but I mean, they've got a million different things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| To me, it seems like it just put us in more of a burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| put a more burden upon us than anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| because every time we want these businesses to succeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| we want them to be able to start as soon as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| They're paying rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| And so it just seems like we're causing harm and we could avoid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| So, I mean, that's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| There's been no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| That's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Is there a second for his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Okay, before we vote on the motion, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Mr. Grady, do you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| You're itching over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| It's nothing against the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| I mean, we sat here and discussed it two or three times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| appropriately in a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| We've been advised by Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| that we can't be arbitrary with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| We can't say this is a great applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| and we'll pass it and then we have another applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| that we don't know and we don't have the history with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| like we do this applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| and we can't pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| And that's why we came to that conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| and it's an important piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| We decided it was an important piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| and I can't support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| on an arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| based on the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| So, I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| anybody jumped to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| So, I think there was pretty much a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| that's the way we were going to handle it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| and I don't see that we can change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| right in the midstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| So, I can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Let's let Councilman Grieve have his say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Holly knows that we all support you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| and we support your business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| and this sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| but I think it's rather inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| that we're discussing process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| all of a sudden while we have applicants here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| that this is an issue that we did bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| at one time and we did discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| and some were in favor of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| and some were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| but I find it a little difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| to be discussing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| in front of our applicants at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| if this is a burning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| with some of our colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Ms. Hanbright, you've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Beer is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| the way we make our money, obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| but I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| to ask about the history of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| people who are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| with this company and does that not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| any impact at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| No, each application is considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| independently. So, if you had 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| restaurants and you came for number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| 16, you'd go through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| for number 16, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| that's where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| So, Councilman Kampen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Thank you, Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Chairman Palmer. I was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| if Rob has anything to weigh in on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| what we have motioned and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| no, I mean, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| no longer a policymaker, I just advise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| council, but as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Councilmember Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| did correctly recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| if you are going to adopt a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| it needs to apply evenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| and to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| if you decide to undo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| the policy, you undo it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| for everyone, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| that was a correct statement of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| earlier conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| Madam Chair, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| I think this whole thing hinges around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| the key period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| of responsibility of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| applicant to go through these classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| having worked in the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| all the years that I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| and I've said this time and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| it is hectic when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| not only opening a business, taking one over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| and there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| a responsibility to get that done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| but I've also seen this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| I don't know how many hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| of times, it's like a mad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| house to get these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| opening up and I know it's still open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| I had coffee there just recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| I think it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| be prudent if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| ask the Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| to actually do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| sampling prior to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| time that we adopted this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| that people that did come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| without the task class and the fingerprinting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| if those are the key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| issues and just actually see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| if they came back before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| beer board and we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| it but we don't really know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| know if that helps us along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| I agree with Councilman Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| I appreciate where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Councilman Starr is coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| not for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| originally that we do it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| I would rather them move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| when it's done, they can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| on out the door and get their business started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| and get taxes and employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| and everything else but it seemed like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| there was an issue too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| from the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| that there was some reluctance on their part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| to go ahead and finalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| that and if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| hear again as to what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| concerned. From our perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| we are only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| contributing to the board, reporting to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| and if what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| to do to report to you is check a box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| yes they did this, yes you did this, we are happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| to do that but to make a judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| we're not in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| position to do that so on the fingerprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| or on the background checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| we can check a box and say they went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| to do it but without the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| being able to peruse that before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| approving, you don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| the outcome of those things were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| and we aren't comfortable saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| oh it's all good, oh it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| not all good. We can check a box and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| they reported it but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| we feel like we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| report to you to make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| and then of course you're referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| issues that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| prohibit them. You're having to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| judgment call on issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| could prohibit them from receiving a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| license. Exactly. So the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| class we can certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| handing documentation check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| a box that says yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| they completed that and we can release it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| but the background checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| require us to make a judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| that we aren't comfortable making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| that is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| we will report to the board those judgments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| but we're not comfortable making them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Let me ask you this. Let's suppose there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| are three people in the business and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| the background and records are checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| two of them come back okay and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| third one does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Would you report it that way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| the business office that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| A and B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| records check is clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| but C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| is not? Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| typically we run into this with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| say a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| who's been added on to an existing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| they come to us after they filled out the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| and submitted to the business tax office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| they'll come to us and we'll do the background checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| and the fingerprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| and upon receiving the results we find out they have a disqualifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| conviction that would prohibit them from being on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| the beer permit then we'll notify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| not just the business tax office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| but we'll notify the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| and also the business that they can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| on the beer permit. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| so there is a bit of a safeguard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| in the fact that they won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| be able to check the box for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| That's correct but I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| in my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| in my capacity as the beer inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| there has been at least one other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| situation where there wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| a disqualifying conviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| but due to the applicant's history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| and criminal history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| that was taken into consideration by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| and they were denied. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Vice Mayor Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| do you want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| I think it warrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| if you would like to appoint an ad hoc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| or a subcommittee to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| if we're going to look at it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| let's look at it completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| and it's your call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| to do that as chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| but I think that that's probably something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| if there are safeguards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| and just really dig| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| into the process because we don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| to put the business office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| into a bad position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| but I'm hearing that we can maybe go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| that so maybe again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| we need to just do a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| further work into it and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| that everybody understands the process here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| rather than deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| you know when the lights are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| the cameras are running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| I will work with Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| and we'll put together a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| and collect information and bring that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Councilman Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| I'd like to call my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| when Sgt. Hunter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| this gets more to the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Ms. Hambright is a fine person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| I've met Mr. Honeycutt before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| a fine person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| this does not apply to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| but you can have situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| where on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| when an applicant is supposed to list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| the times they've gotten in trouble with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| and sometimes they might list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| and then Sgt. Hunter does the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| and there's a laundry list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| of things that come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| now some of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| people might be able to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| some might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| but on rare occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| this beer board in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| has denied someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| because when they fill out this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| it's probably true and correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| and then they've forgotten about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| they've gotten picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| or cited for different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| and those have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| people have been denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| like I said it doesn't apply to the current applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| but if you have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| situation where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| they haven't been in for the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| and someone has put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| none and the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| comes up with a laundry list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| of violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| you might be putting Sgt. Hunter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| or Ms. Day or Ms. Dyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| in a situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| we're making a judgment call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| we're not making a check the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| description as Ms. Dyer said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Councilman Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| is your light an old light or a new light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| ok we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| from Mr. Stair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| and then we have a motion from Mr. Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Mr. Frost which motion do we hear first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| I think we'd hear Mr. Grieve's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1351)|

| 0:22:35| we have a first and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Mr. Johnson's wanting to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| well I didn't get a motion from Mr. Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1359)|

| 0:22:55| hold on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| I thought we had a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| I just asked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| the motion to postpone is heard before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| approve the main motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| alright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1391)|

| 0:23:27| from Mr. Stair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| a motion to adjourn would be heard before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1409)|

| 0:23:47| to the beer board practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1427)|

| 0:24:01| documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1441)|

| 0:24:17| postpone to a certain time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| appears to be a priority motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| someone made a motion to amend my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1461)|

| 0:32:39| on September 3rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1959)|

| 0:33:09| and they're obviously not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=1989)|

| 0:35:06| I don't think it was too tough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2106)|

| 0:35:10| this is in some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| if you'll entertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| my way of thinking this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| kind of his first infraction that being said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| it appears he has taken this very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| he has since bought a card scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| I even asked him to bring it with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2122)|

| 0:35:34| I don't know if a sting is the appropriate word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| but he's had actually a secret shopper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| come and test his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| system and training out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| we think that going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2142)|

| 0:37:09| submitted a really comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| paid fines to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| they've had their license suspended at least once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| and so they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| faced the penalty for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| transgressions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| this business had not previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| had any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| and suddenly they had two pretty close together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| so I would like to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| that we not take any further action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| and we will never see you again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| do I have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| all those in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| the next time we won't be kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| I just want to clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| we actually came in front of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| for this incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| there was also a pending TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| citation at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| that we were coming forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| before your action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| my clients accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| responsibility with TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| on the same set of facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| and they handed out a 10 day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| so it's all part and parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| it's not a new offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| we knew that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| there's some procedural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| issues with our hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| within 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| and TABC sometimes takes longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| you've done a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| and again we'll not see you again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| all right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| this takes care of the formal part of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| I believe am I correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| all right now we are supposed to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| adjusting the distance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| for beer permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| currently the city ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| identifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| certain establishments that cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| have beer served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| any place within 300 feet of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| TABC will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| permit 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| so consequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| when people come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| and they're 286 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| we tell them that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| can get a TABC permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| play second fiddle to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| and so then you'll automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| get a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| so what that does is require people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| to make application to TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| and also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| put up a bond and it's a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| expensive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| in which we are essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| sending them through a loophole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| for something that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| probably handle here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| so Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| and I appreciate you bringing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| before us tonight because this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| that we have heard numerous times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| as a beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| and I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| a friend call me a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| and explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| we're being denied this beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| on this property because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| a distance requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| and before the words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| came out of my mouth I heard what I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| saying and it's like oh all you have to do is fly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| for a TABC and you can get around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| and so it seems very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| hypocritical to me in a poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| policy when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| we announce what the policy is and right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| behind it we tell you how to get around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| and it just seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| that we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| mirror what the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| TABC policy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| remove such loophole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| I mean the cost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| have a TABC license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| is several thousand dollars as I understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| plus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| application and process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| and we've offered it from here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| oh well don't worry about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| distance requirement because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| here's how you get around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| and come back and apply and spend more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I just think it's an unfair thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| I think that it's probably an outdated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| policy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| it's something that we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| I'd like to see us mirror the TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| requirements and make it where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| Do I have anyone else who wants to weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| weigh out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| I would just second and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| thank you all for bringing it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I think it's a great point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| it doesn't make any sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| you've got to be 30 feet if you just have beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| but if you get liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| you can get within 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| to me there's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| no logic behind it at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| alright we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| I did check the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| we've had 6 instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| this calendar year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| of people who have been within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| and so they to a person have gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| around the barn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| and gotten a license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| so this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| something that we need to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| so I need to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| that this group would like us to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| an amendment to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| to change it to 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| is that my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| that's what I'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| let's have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| and a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| I make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| reduce our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| distance requirement to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| exactly the same as TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| let me jump in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| we have to have an ordinance prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| on a council agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| tonight's vote is nothing more than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| straw vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| we all understood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| I second it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| we have a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| councilman de la vope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| I'm just wondering from sergeant hunter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| the original 300 foot rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| do you know any of the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| about it obviously we don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| people with beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| or in an inebriated condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| by schools and churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| and that must be the reason for the 300 foot rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| do you have anything to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| us in on how we got there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| no sir all that was adopted prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| I've checked to see where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| originated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| and it was probably 40 or 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| when times were different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| and some things were different than they are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| but if a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| if a person can get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| liquor license they can be within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| 50 feet of any of these forbidden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| places that the city requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| I actually believe that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| zero feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| it can be next door I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| there is even a 50 foot requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| well why have we been telling people 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| no I think that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| distance requirement for a liquor store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| not liquor by the drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| so a package store that can carry it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| yes because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| we're talking on premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| which I mean you're drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| the alcoholic beverage on premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| so this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| next door I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Vice Mayor Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I don't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| necessarily disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| the discussion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| but what I do disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| I think that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| to maybe put some brakes on to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| I mean this has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| huge implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| through our educational system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| churches that are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| there's a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| that are involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| and I think that it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| very prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| allow this to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| vetted a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| I mean I think we need to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| this is a big big change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| it's happened through a lot of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| I mean I think the city law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| should weigh in on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| I think the police department should weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| and again I don't necessarily disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| with what we're doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| but I think it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| given to the greater public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| and get some more input back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| before we just jump in and bring an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| ordinance to the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| I mean this is a packed house of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| carrying signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I mean I can just see that coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| so I would just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| that we proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| but we proceed with caution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| and let these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| hear from other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| before we make this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| it's just my two cents worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Would he move to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| assign someone to look into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| or to report back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| I'm not going to stand in front of the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| I mean that would be her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| decision to do it. I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| that that's the way that we need to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| you all can tell me to shut up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| and we're going to do it on the next agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| but I just really think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| slow down and get input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| from other people and let other people know what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Well I just wanted to bring it here and have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| so I think that's very prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| and let's talk about it for a couple months and see what people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| It's just a reoccurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| thing, what did you say, six times this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| So let's just talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| for a few months and this will probably make the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| now that we've talked about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| I see Megan sitting out there typing away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| And that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| I seconded it. I didn't assume that we were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| to vote on it the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| We do need public input. I fully agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| with you on that and I think that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| George and I are really talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| is let's bring it up and find out what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| the situation is. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| So we've talked about it now and we're going to let it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| fester for about two or three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| after the first of the year when we reorganize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| and then go from there. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Is that what I'm hearing from everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Well I think a workshop would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| I don't know how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| I think the word's going to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| but I think from our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| that we need official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| that this could possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| A lot of people that could be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| I hear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| I agree with that. I think going cautiously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| is a prudent way to address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Megan's grinning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Definitely want to be prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| She's already told the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| The headline in the paper tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Councilman Wallace wants beer in the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| And I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| hear that either. I just heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| we've got a policy that we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| want to look at. I just didn't hear the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| part about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| No, you're right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| We don't need to jump into this tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Or the next day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| It's not an urgent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| So being no other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Oh, Councilman Starr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Do you want to discuss your issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| or wait until the next time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| I don't think it's had enough discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Alright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| No new business. We're adjourned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151027?start=2867)|
