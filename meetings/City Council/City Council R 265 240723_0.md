| 0:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| A motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=152)|

| 0:02:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| And just a quick comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| That had to do with a parcel of land up in Enskip, and I want to commend the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| Mr. Steve Goodson, for talking to me and the neighbors about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| That parcel will continue to be under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| We're looking for a win-win where it will be beneficial to the developer and also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| a good impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| One of the things that's being discussed, and I'm seeing it's just discussed, is possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| obtaining that parcel of land and making it part of the Enskip Pool Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| That park is really stressed with a lot of the development and traffic up there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| so this would kind of relieve some of the things going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| So anyway, a shout out to Mr. Goodson, and those conversations will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=208)|

| 0:03:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=210)|

| 0:03:32| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=212)|

| 0:04:13| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=253)|

| 0:18:53| Since the environmental issues were raised about this property, could anyone update us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| on what those plans are for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1137)|
| 0:19:07| I'm happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Thanks for bringing that topic up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| We have been working closely with the property owner as they have acquired this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| and done the due diligence to explore what the contaminants in the area are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| There is a brownfield agreement and an opportunity to work with an EPA grant for the cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| I know when I met with the developer, the condition of the site does limit development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| This site cannot be residential, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| I feel like there was even something about the aspect of the business that's going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1186)|
| 0:19:56| there in that there's so much green space that people will not really be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| Is that also part of it or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| I'm not really clear on the distinction you're making there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| They're not paving the entire site, but the areas that will be utilized, the term is usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| capped with asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| It's all part of the soil remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Ms. Parker, I believe one of the advantages of this development concept is that a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| portion of the unusable site is not going to be accessed by regular patrons, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| The design of this type of site, it will be capped and it won't be accessible for part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| The area that's being developed that people will be walking on and utilizing will be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| of the building, so it will be capped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| The other area that's part of the field, so to speak, where the golf balls go, that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| is open and is not capped, but soil remediation will still happen as part of the cleanup on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| the entire site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1263)|

| 0:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| I still have some concerns about the rezoning and look forward to speaking with planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1266)|

| 0:21:23| I do expect it to pass, but simply to give us pause when thinking about this area, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| goals of the neighborhood, the goals we have for areas close into downtown, wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| make sure it remains walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| This may be the best improved zoning that this property can get, but I'd like to struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| with it a little bit more and see if new development can come into this area with an even less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1307)|
| 0:21:56| intense zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| That's my reasoning for voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1319)|

| 0:24:25| Any speakers for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| I think I know the answer to, but, you know, it says that the lease runs from 2023, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| is already started, goes to 2026.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| I assume this is coming back to us because there's an amendment requiring the sale of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Midway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| I mean, is that why this is before us, because it should have been renewed or done back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| 2023?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Yeah, this is before you because we've significantly changed the terms of the original agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| so we sat down with the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| And, by the way, the executive director is here and longtime board member, one of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| attorneys is here, so they've been working with the law department and our team on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| So, it's here really to give assurances to the fair and the city's commitment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| fair, which, as everyone knows, has been around over 100 years in East Knoxville, but to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| allow for the redevelopment of areas adjacent to Chauhaui Park and the Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| There's a lot of activity happening in those areas, so this is to allow those to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| but the fair has assurances for the 24, the 25, and the 26 fair, so they can be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| but we can allow changes and redevelopment and new investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| I just think that need to be said out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Because those of us that know, know, but otherwise it looks like we're approving something after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| I believe you mentioned the director and board members are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Would you stand or raise your hand to be recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you for your role in the community and how hard you've worked with the city to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| these next few years possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| If you don't mind, I would love to hear from the director just shortly about upcoming plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1574)|
| 0:26:25| for the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| It looks like this lease agreement ensures we will have a fair through 2026.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1590)|
| 0:26:39| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| I mean, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Just real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1604)|

| 0:26:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Scott Zombski, Executive Director of Tennessee Valley Fair, 7920 Oak Ridge Highway in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1612)|

| 0:26:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1615)|

| 0:26:57| Finish your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1617)|

| 0:26:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Do you all have any plans beyond 2026?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I mean, we'd love to be able to stay there in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| We've been a cornerstone in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| You know, the lease, as you see it right there, beyond the 2026 fair gets a little bit complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| We're only given six months to be able to plan a fair, which really is not doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| So we'd hope we'd be able to get a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| You know, we're presenting the lease from the city, and it was pretty much here's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| lease, take it, or there's no more fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| So, you know, we understand East Magnolia is a growing and developing area, and we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| to be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| But that's kind of where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| I appreciate that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| I know that there are a lot of folks in our community who really value the fair, have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| valued it their entire lives, and are very interested to stay informed on the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| of the fair here in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| So thank you for keeping us informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| And I think, you know, we do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| We did an economic impact study back in 2018 that showed the fair generated over $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| for Knoxville and Knox County, and there's a lot of local folks that get some seasonal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| money by being employed during the fair, and there's a whole lot of neighbors that sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| parking spots out in front of their houses to be able to make some extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| So we feel like we're a very valuable part of Knoxville, have been since we started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| and hopefully we can get some things resolved so 27 and beyond can be a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| favorable to us, so we can plan to have a great fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1718)|

| 0:30:53| I think a lot of the work is ramp related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Oh, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| I'd be happy to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| It's basically adding a sidewalk that goes from the building and the parking area down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| to the playground and the basketball courts that are around and also adds a staircase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| that also gets you down to where the basketball courts are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| To make them all more accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| I can vouch that that access to the basketball court is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| You know, you've got that slope down there and that's about the only way you can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| And just for the public, that's a great basketball court down there for an outside court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| It's one of the best ones I've ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| It seems to be underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| So just FYI for people who want to shoot some baskets and play outside, that's a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| good court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| So just for the record, it's been like that for eons and we've had to go down that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| And actually, those were tennis courts at one point before they were turned into basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| So we actually had Candace Parker here a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| This was one of the, gosh, what was it called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| It was from a gaming system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| They were doing these different parks in different, exactly, yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| And so a lot of folks from the community came down and helped paint it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| Candace Parker was actually out here a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| So beautiful, beautiful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Love that we're investing some more dollars into those renovations, but especially for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| the access to those basketball courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Prettiest courts in town, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| And as it is, I almost get as much of a workout getting up and down that hill as I do when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| I get to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| But thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| That's really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1967)|

| 0:33:08| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| I will just say on behalf of Mayor Kincannon, I know she is an advocate for these Bollards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| and the safety they provide pedestrians, so if you're watching at home, Mayor, this one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Could someone help us understand how these will function and operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2002)|
| 0:33:32| Is it a KPD question or engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| They basically are a hole that is dug in the ground and these Bollards are installed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| that hole and then it will be evened up with the surrounding ground and it will have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| handle and a key on it and so we'll be able to have folks come out, unlock it, they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| be able to raise the Bollard up and lock them in place and they'll basically be 17 of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| oriented around the market square area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| If you come down for a farmer's market, it's basically similar to the way it's locked off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| for those types of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| The big difference, too, is that we don't have to bring employees out with trailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| and equipment every single time we want to do an event, so it's operationalizing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| ability to open streets up for pedestrians in a way that is, you know, less labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| So there's an initial investment, but there's actually some reduction in long-term operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Well, and also, when I imagined it, I didn't imagine it being hidden until in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2061)|
| 0:34:29| And that was one of my concerns, was that we would have all of these ready-to-go barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| You know, you push a button and it swings out and blocks the road, but okay, I get what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| these are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| My only concern is that they're going to be very popular and be ready for requests from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| other walkable surrounding areas to the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| You send all those to Grant Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2091)|

| 0:34:55| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2095)|

| 0:34:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| See?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| It's contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2101)|

| 0:35:42| This has been a long project in a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| It's sustained investment, but I think this is the last of this big project in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| a phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Would you talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| I'm going to ask Wes Sword to join us at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| He's been directing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2158)|

| 0:36:08| So this is the final phase of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| It started how many years ago now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| About six years ago, I think, in the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| This will finish that project out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| There's a sister pavilion at Book Ends Gateway Park that we just opened at Baker Creek earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| this year, and this will kind of complete that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2186)|

| 0:46:19| Get your guys to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| These people should not be dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| That homeless person up in Milwaukee should not be dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2788)|
| 0:46:35| Because y'all went up there for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| What did y'all learn up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Y'all could have been spending that time training here rather than going up to Milwaukee for that farce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2799)|
| 0:46:49| I am so frustrated with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| When I was a little girl, and that was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| That was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| I respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| My mom and daddy taught me to, if you're in trouble, you go find somebody wearing a badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| If you get lost, you go find somebody wearing a badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| They taught me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| I taught my kid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| I used to teach my kids at Faxon School that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| There are certain criteria, and I don't think y'all have this criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| You're supposed to be able to work with people that are disabled, that are in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| You're supposed to be able to do that to earn this money, and I don't think y'all can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| Thank you, Ms. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Please do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| Counsel, that's the only speaker for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Any discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| I'll have one for Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Chief, would you explain to the public what these funds will be used for and how the department plans to maximize those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| We plan to enhance our existing de-escalation training by bringing in outside speakers to speak to our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| We also just took delivery on a virtual firearm simulator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| This money will allow us to create different scenarios where officers will be placed and shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| Don't shoot scenarios where they also have to verbally de-escalate and interact with the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| and we're going to use this money to help continue to create more and more complex scenarios to help train our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Counselwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| I have concerns about those simulations, because I've participated in them multiple times now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2915)|
| 0:48:47| I think that there can be value, but it just depends on how you're using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| The last one I used was to train an officer on how to properly use their stun guns, whatever you call those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2934)|
| 0:49:08| In that situation, we want police to take the least lethal option available for them to be able to resolve whatever issue they're working on in that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2948)|
| 0:49:25| That simulation, I see value there, because it's training officers to go for that stun gun rather than their handgun first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2965)|
| 0:49:36| What type of simulation would be purchased through this grant money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| We already have a simulator that allows officers to simulate using all of the tools in their tool belt, including their TASER, but it starts off with verbal commands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2981)|
| 0:49:51| I think the one you used was when TASER was here with their roadshow, I guess, when they were trying to sell TASERs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| This would be a scenario where the officers would have to make the appropriate decisions using all of the tools in their gun belt, from their firearm all the way down to their verbal commands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=2998)|
| 0:50:10| The other simulator that I experienced was through NKPD's training room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| My experience with that was it makes you feel as if you have to be ready to use your gun in all situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3018)|
| 0:50:33| I don't know if this is going to be a different simulator than the one that I used, but the one that I used, it was scenario after scenario that made you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3033)|
| 0:50:44| Every other detail I've assessed in this situation is wrong, and I should always assume this person could present the highest threat to me possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3044)|
| 0:51:01| That, to me, does not leave room for them to analyze and to consider other options other than lethal force as soon as they question what is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3061)|
| 0:51:14| We train our officers to respond to the incident, always evaluate the information that's in front of them, and respond with the appropriate level of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3074)|
| 0:51:27| With this de-escalation training, we're training officers to go in and respond with the level of resistance that they're facing that could start with verbal commands that could be deadly force, could be TASERs, could be pepper spray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3087)|
| 0:51:41| It's different scenarios that could cause a wide variety of different responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| I'm not going to be able to support this today, and what I want to do is share the research that I found on these simulators and hope that you will take it into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3108)|
| 0:52:03| This is not to buy a simulator. We already have a simulator we just bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| This is to help create new scenarios to use with that simulator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| So it's like software for the simulator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Okay. All right. That's helpful. I'll send that information over and would really appreciate if you could check it out. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3137)|

| 0:55:09| Up first for Item 12A in favor of the ordinance is Jax Fox. Jax, if you could come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3309)|
| 0:55:28| Jax Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| Okay, seeing her not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3330)|
| 0:55:45| One speaker in opposition of this, Mr. Bentley Marlow. Mr. Marlow, if you would step forward, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921. I'm not in District 5. My issue with this primarily is one that having followed every rule that has been passed by Council to make amendments to the zoning ordinance, and going above and beyond, because if you recall, I started at planning, and then they sidestepped it, so I appealed it to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3351)|
| 0:56:18| And then you guys, at my request, threw it back to planning, where it had yet another meeting, and then left there and came here for a second hearing. It had four meetings, four public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3378)|
| 0:56:30| Each time at planning, it had at least three weeks of public comments gathered online, and then it came back to City Council for the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3390)|
| 0:56:40| So four meetings where people from the public could sign up and speak. And people did sign up and speak at all four meetings, and public comments were made every week that it was allowed at planning on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3400)|
| 0:56:52| Yet, I was heard repeatedly that there was not enough public input and public process. That was four public meetings, four opportunities for people to sign up and speak, four plus weeks of online comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3412)|
| 0:57:08| If that's not enough public process and public input to make a zoning ordinance change, then I dare say that a single workshop in which I attempted to sign up to speak and was told that there would be no public comment at that workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3428)|
| 0:57:23| and then tonight, where it appears that there's going to be no movement to waive your own rules to allow members who have signed up to speak on these amendments, it appears to me that we don't really value public process or public input when the establishment or the mayor or the administration or Mr. Roberto in West Knoxville wants to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3443)|
| 0:57:45| And I think that's what's at the heart of all of this, is that the function of these proposals should require some robust discussion, because they are in essence changing the very foundational documents that control and govern our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3465)|
| 0:58:02| It's like making willy-nilly changes to the Constitution of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| The second issue I have with this is that if we were to move the 5th District, and I understand they feel lonely, but if we were to move it, we would have six seats, a majority, a super majority, if you will, of council that could change at any single election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3488)|
| 0:58:24| It destroys the continuity and the predictability from the business community that our regulations and our regulations would have any consistency, because depending on the weather of whatever political movement is afloat and popular at that particular election cycle, you could potentially upend the majority of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3504)|
| 0:58:43| I would like to see more discussion, and I have a proposal. I think that we should go to at-large, the three at-larges to serve six-year terms, so that they have more of an invested stake and can see through whatever whelm is popular at this particular election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3523)|
| 0:58:58| By doing so, then you could structure so that three of the district seats could be on the ballot with one at-large, and then in the second cycle, you would have three at-larges and one of the six-year at-larges, three districts with one of the at-larges, and then you would just be rotating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3538)|
| 0:59:15| At no point in time would you have more than four ever be possible to change on council, which would provide more predictability and stability to predict the future of regulations and policies for the business community and citizens at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3555)|
| 0:59:30| But at the end of the day, I truly believe, and it was used against me, and remind you, I had four public meetings. Each meeting allowed discussion, and in many of those discussions, I recall, the rules were waived to allow more than three people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3570)|
| 0:59:46| I urge that the same should be. That should be the standard when discussing matters as pertinent as a city-charger change. That is my only opposition to this. We need more process. We need more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3586)|
| 1:00:03| And I would oppose putting more than the current set-up of voting five all at once, but allowing six all at once just makes it too unpredictable, because we could totally change the majority of council. A super majority of council could potentially be changed overnight. And what kind of wreck and havoc would that cause to policies and procedures? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3603)|
| 1:00:27| Thank you, council. That concludes members of the public who have signed up for this item. Council members, for this item and the subsequent items, council members Thomas, Roberto, and Parker are sponsors of those items, so as a result, you'll get eight minutes to make introductory remarks if you'd like to. So, council member Thomas, you want that privilege? You're welcome to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3627)|
| 1:00:53| Yes, I will be somewhat brief. Actually, this is an issue that all my council members, I'm sure, are well aware of over the years. We've had a workshop. It's also been discussed a lot out in the community in the 5th District for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3653)|
| 1:01:08| The situation right now in the 5th District is because the 5th District is not in with the other districts and it's in the cycle with all the at-large seats, right now, any person in the 5th District can only run for city council once every four years. That's been going on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3668)|
| 1:01:29| If you live in any other district in the city, you will have the opportunity to run for your district seat or in two years, you would have an opportunity to run for an at-large seat. So, you would have an opportunity in any district besides the 5th District right now to seek a city council seat every two years. That's the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3689)|
| 1:01:51| With the current plan of the Tennessee Legislature, not only would people not have the opportunity to run for city council seat every four years, they wouldn't even be able to vote for any city council seat for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3711)|
| 1:02:10| It's completely unjust. All we're asking for, simply, is that the 5th District just be treated like every other district. Also, it's been so confusing over the years to run in the 5th District and have to explain, well, you can vote for this seat then and seat for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3730)|
| 1:02:34| We've just been this outlier and I think that some of that has accounted for somewhat less political activity in the 5th District than some of the other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3754)|
| 1:02:46| So, anyway, I obviously am going to make the motion to approve this and I support it and I also, at the proper time, will have an amendment on just a tweaking on some of the language that Mr. Swanson and I have talked about just to make some clarity on one of the sentences. That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3766)|
| 1:03:07| Council, there's a motion. We need a second if it's okay. Thank you. Before we continue discussion. Next up, Councilmember Roberto. Excuse me, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3787)|
| 1:03:17| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Councilman Thomas, I just want to have you reiterate something for clarity for everyone that I think I just heard you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3799)|
| 1:03:27| So, if I were to run for a district seat, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and I lost, in two years, I could run for an at-large seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3807)|
| 1:03:41| But I could never run for the 5th District and an at-large. So, the 5th District, somebody could run for the at-large seats, but they couldn't run for the 5th District because you guys are on the same cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3821)|
| 1:03:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Because the way our elections are set up, you can't run for two at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| Well, I'm not sure I'm following you, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| But if I lost in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6, I could then come back in two years and run for an at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| But if I lost in the 5th, I'd have to wait four years to run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Because you're off cycle with the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| Because the 5th District is in the same cycle with all the at-large seats, the opportunity to run for City Council, if you're in the 5th District, is just that one cycle that comes around every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3860)|
| 1:04:34| If you're in any other district besides the 5th, you have a chance to run for your district seat, and then in two years, whether you lost or not, you would have a chance to run at an at-large seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3874)|
| 1:04:47| Or even if you didn't run in the district seat that time, in two years, you would have an opportunity to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| So there would be an opportunity to run for City Council every two years in every other district except the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3893)|
| 1:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| I appreciate the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| In regards to the concern about how long this has been discussed publicly or any of the other things, when was the workshop that we had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3907)|
| 1:05:16| I think Councilman Roberto might be able to tell me or somebody else or Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| When was the workshop that we had about – there was the workshop last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| There was a previous workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| When was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| The last workshop on this topic was in November of 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| So not quite a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| And any decisions that we make tonight voting up or down any of these charter amendments, we are not making the changes to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| It actually goes out for the ultimate public discussion, which is the voters get to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| Is that correct, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| So everyone has the chance to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| It's not a representative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Just to underline your point, what we decide here, we'll just put it on the ballot for the people to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| So we're not the final say on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| It will have to go up to the public to see if they approve it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| What Councilmember Ryder just said is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| And it goes to the point of why the zoning discussion that we had just a minute ago is not the same as the charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3987)|
| 1:06:36| Because the zoning, that's the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| The final decision that we're talking about tonight for all of these is the voters of the city in a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4000)|
| 1:06:48| So all that these charter amendments are doing is giving the voters the choice to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4008)|
| 1:07:00| We're just putting it on the ballot for them to be able to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| They're the final arbiters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| They're the final ones to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| And the changes that Councilmember Thomas just talked about, and the reason I'm supporting this and what he's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4028)|
| 1:07:17| is because the changes to the elections have already happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| So what you're used to for the last 55 years isn't going to be going on anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| What he's providing you is in conjunction with 12B, because that's intended to give you a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4049)|
| 1:07:38| where you can make a choice to choose a district-only process or make a choice to do a hybrid-at-large process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4058)|
| 1:07:47| Council is not making that decision, merely putting it on the ballot for you, the voters, to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| And I support this because if we did elect and choose to have a district-only process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4075)|
| 1:08:04| then the 5th district will be treated very unfairly, and they would only get a chance to vote in city elections once every four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4084)|
| 1:08:20| where every other district in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 will be able to vote every two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4100)|
| 1:08:30| because we get to vote in our district race, and then we get to vote in the at-large races two years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| And I don't think that's fair. We shouldn't be treating people differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| So since the system has changed, and since we are hopefully going to be able to give the voters an option to choose what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| then I think we have to make this change to make sure it's fair to everybody. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| Thank you, Councilmember Roberto. I just want to note before I go to Councilwoman Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| Stephanie O'Hara is here. Ms. O'Hara works for MTAS. Everybody on Council is familiar with MTAS's role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| but you've done a lot of research on this and on these other items before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| So just for Council, she's here. She wasn't able to make it to the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| but they provided a lot of research for Mr. Frost and other Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| So if you have a question for MTAS, Ms. O'Hara is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| Councilwoman Fugate. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| I think it's been talked about, but to be clear, people from the 5th District currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| two people could be running at the same time, one for the 5th District seat and one for an at-large seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| I do get the point that it's only every four years, but I don't want people to think that means nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| from the 5th District could ever be running for an at-large seat currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| because they could at the same time somebody's running for the District seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| It would be confusing for the 5th District, but I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| Now I will also say, because my colleagues, this will not come as a surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| I have been saying for a long time I think that our city should seriously consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| a formal charter review process that makes it where every certain number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| we really do look at the charter and aren't always reacting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| I mean, we are where we are now because the speed with which we started talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| less than a year ago is because the state law changed, which changed the way our election started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| But it is like every organization. I run a non-profit. We look at our bylaws every few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| Things change. We talked about it in our city council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| I think that would be something for us to continue to look at, separate and apart from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| because there are opportunities for us to take a look at how the world has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| and if there are things that we want to look at that are less in the heat of the moment, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4254)|
| 1:11:02| I think that's a good thing. That doesn't negate the urgency of this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| because absent doing anything, our election rules and the way we as a city chose to vote in the 1960s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4267)|
| 1:11:23| will not be available to us, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| We can't do district races in a primary and then city at large. That's gone to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4287)|
| 1:11:37| So I'm sorry I editorialized about that, but I really mean it is why we are having this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| because to Mr. Marlowe's point, and I think a lot of people would agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| in a perfect world, we would have a regular schedule that we would look at things and not be reactionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4308)|
| 1:11:56| So I will just continue to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| Thank you. Councilwoman Helsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| For anybody who wasn't tuned in to the workshop the other day, Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| would you explain how they got off the cycle anyway that they used to be with the other districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| I mean, it's kind of weird but interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| Yes. In 1969 was the first election that was held under the current existing election system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4341)|
| 1:12:29| When the change was made, I believe there was a bargain made to allow the sitting council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4349)|
| 1:12:37| for the 5th District serve a longer term because she had just been elected into office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| and they did not want to force her to run for re-election in a very short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| Thank you, sir. We want those rules too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| And so I think I have voiced some concern as well about all of the district representatives rolling off at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4379)|
| 1:13:06| So thank you for that history, Mr. Johnson, about why that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| why the 5th District was not on the same schedule because it sounds like at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| all district seats were on the election ballot at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| Is that a correct statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| I'm not confident I know the answer to that about the cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| It was on before 1969.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| So what we have is that you have six representatives rolling off that have institutional knowledge about government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4411)|
| 1:13:40| just like we all had to get acclimated and had to get oriented when we came on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| and we were fortunate to have sitting city council members who were able to kind of help us through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| not to take anything away from the three at large seats whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| Again, I think putting it on the ballot, as we will potentially these other items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| is probably going to be the better route for us to take at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| Council Member Thomas, can you help us understand what you said about at a later date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4451)|
| 1:14:18| language would be updated in what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| It's just in this meeting I'm going to make an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| and it was actually to a point you and I talked about in the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| and there was some confusing language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| If you look at the substance of it, it probably wouldn't matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| but we're not all lawyers looking at language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| And if you, I guess more of a layperson actually, or less, not even that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| if you looked at that language, it was misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| But what I would like to do is make an amendment just on one sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| the one that you and I talked about at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| So are you going to wait for the second reading to do the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| No, I was going to do it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| but I wasn't quite sure what the protocol was about discussing the different referendums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4499)|
| 1:15:07| Mr. Frost, you can make that a proposed amendment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Okay, let's do that now and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| If we look at section 2, that's on packet number 833.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4513)|
| 1:15:33| And yes, for the public, I said that, page 833 of a long jacket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| But it is the second sentence in the second paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| And the way it is right now, it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| the terms of the office of the six geographically distributed council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| shall expire on the 20th day of December 2025| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| or at such time as a successor is qualified or sworn into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| Now, the way it reads, it almost sounds like my term would end on the 20th day of December 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4567)|
| 1:16:17| But, you know, I go two more years because we're out of sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| The following language, or at some time as a successor is qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| and sworn into office, actually would take care of that if you look deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| But it's just confusing and so Director Swanson and I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| and we would suggest that that second sentence is simply replaced with the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| the terms of the office of the geographically distributed council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| currently designated as districts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| shall expire on the 20th day of December 2025| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| or at such time as a successor is qualified and sworn into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| So that would substitute the second sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| What would stay and be more explanatory is after that it says the term beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| December 18, 2027 for the council member from the fifth council district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| will be for two years and shall end on December 15, 2029| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| and thereafter will align geographically with the other council members' terms for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4648)|
| 1:17:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| We have a motion and a second for Council Member Thomas' amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| Now we'll have a discussion on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4667)|
| 1:17:56| Are there any questions or discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| Councilwoman Parker, is your light related to the amendment or the original proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4679)|
| 1:18:17| I think it's still a little unclear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| but it would only be unclear until Council Member Thomas' term ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4700)|
| 1:18:28| and so I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| And this language actually won't affect the way that it will go on the charter on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| so it'll still be the same on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| I think that's correct, isn't it, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| Any discussion around the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| All those in favor of the amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Okay, the amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Now to the ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| Any discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4757)|
| 1:19:24| 12B is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| specifically Chapter 412 of the Private Acts of 1923| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4769)|

| 1:19:51| and All Acts Amendatory Thereto by Amending Article 7, Section 707| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4791)|

| 1:20:20| and Article 7, Section 704| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4820)|

| 1:20:30| to the Qualified Voters of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4830)|

| 1:20:41| of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Council Member, we have some members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| who have signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| One member in favor and one, two, three, four, six opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| Again, Council's rules are to allow for three speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| for both in favor or opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| So in favor of the item is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Yes, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| I'd like to make a motion that we suspend our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| since we are considering charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| I think it's important that we hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| But I do need a second to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| There's been a motion and a second to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| to allow for up to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| Well, there's just six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| All six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| All speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| I think there's six or seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Yeah, so seven, I think, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| All seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| In favor, first up, Reverend Harold Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| One quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| He's on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4921)|
| 1:22:10| Reverend Middlebrook, if you would state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| and you have up to five minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| My name is Harold Middlebrook, 2334 Dandridge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4937)|
| 1:22:25| For almost 50 years, I've been wrestling and fighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| with this whole idea about how we elect our council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| For more than 20 years, I was one of those who said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| that we ought to elect in the district for the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| elect in the district for the city at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| I was of that opinion because during my early days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| I was a civil rights fighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| I fought for integration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| What I got was desegregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| But I fought that in the hopes that minds would change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| that hearts would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| Since that time, we've been voting that you elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| the person in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| They have to run citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| That concerned me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| But in the last few years, I think I've seen a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| in the attitude of the people of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| I've seen some hearts change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| I've seen some people run in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| and people across the city stood with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| I've even seen this city vote for Barack Obama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| That was a mystery to me for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| and I just shouted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Of course, I hope they're going to do it for Kamala Harris also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| but that's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| I'm of the opinion that as we look at the demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| and the change, as we look at the fact that this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| is beginning to change and to consider people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| I'm so happy that Councilmember Parker has been able to stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| in this city twice and run at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| and the people of this city have elected her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| I'm delighted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| And so I say to you that perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| given what the state is trying to do to us and all of the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| we need to allow the people of the city, by referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| to speak to this issue, to say yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| and to carry on dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| So I am appealing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| Consider putting this issue before the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| Let the people speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| Let the people have a voice in what happens in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| and those who will represent the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| I believe, I'm convinced, maybe that's just the preacher in me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| but I'm convinced that hearts are changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| and that we will ensure that there will still be representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| from our community elected to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| because it will give us a chance to see the makeup of the total city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| and what we can do together when we work in unison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| Please give the people a voice and a chance to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| First speaker who has signed up in opposition to Item 12B is Mr. Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| That's a tough act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| My opposition here is much like it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| I don't think that something of the magnitude of a charter change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| should come about so swiftly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| It is. It reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| I mean, many of you have told me it's a reactionary move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| in response to the state legislature, and I'm just befuddled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| Why did we wait so long to address it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| Why didn't we get ahead of the state legislature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| Why did we not address these issues before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| I mean, Dr. Middlebrook just said that for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| he thought that the district should elect their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| Why did we not ever consider that before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Why are we scared of it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| Just because this might be the brainchild of Eric Whittier and Elaine Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| and the Republican supermajority in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| that doesn't necessarily make it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| We only vote for one state representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| I live in the 6th City Council District, and I live in Sam McKenzie's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| I can only vote for him or his opponent, Daysha Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| I can't vote for all the rest of the state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| that make up the Knoxville Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| I only get to vote for one congressman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| I don't get to vote for all the congressmen that represent the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| Why should the city be any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| I've heard many of you say, once we get past the knee-jerk reaction of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| well, you know who sponsored this, or you know this is a Republican conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| Once we get beyond that, nobody really has a good answer why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| other than the standard seems to be the new boilerplate is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| well, right now you get to vote for all nine, and so you're losing a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| Well, that would work in theory if we knew that all of the six districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| voted at about the same turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| So what we see is the 2nd District, West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| has an oversized say in everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| And if you want to doubt that, let's go back and look at the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| and how many hours we spent wrestling missing middle stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| when it was limited to TDR that had nothing to do with most of West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| or the 2nd District, but they showed up in numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| They filled up your inboxes, and their area was excluded entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| But they got a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| Look at the proposal I had last week over the definition of kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| and how it applies to ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| That had an oversized presence and say and email from West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| So to me, I think it gives too much power to West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| when everyone has to answer to them, and you have to answer to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| if you're an elected city at large because they come out and vote in such great numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| So let's think this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| Use me as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| I can take the ridicule or shame that comes with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| I can't win the district I live in and worked in and operated a business in for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| Just look at what I did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| There's no way I can win it under the current rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| or if we just leave the state alone and let the state default go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| There's no way I could win it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| But under Mr. Roberto's rule, under this provision, there's a chance I could win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| That I would lose the 6th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| None of my neighbors would support me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| But because I polled so well out in West Knoxville and in the 5th, that I might just win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| So I'm sitting here, once again, advocating something that's against my self-interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| because I don't think it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| And you know, I don't want to get personal or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| but I heard Mr. Roberto say about my appeal last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| that I was trying to circumvent and play with loose language in our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| I think that this is nothing more than trying to circumvent and play with language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| to get around a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| So I'm just going to call it the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| I think if we're going to do this, we need to have a large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| concerted public information gathering campaign with public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| a lot of robust discussion, and we should come up with a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| that's not a reaction to what's going on in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| It ought to be what's best for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| And I believe what's best for Knoxville is letting the voices of the 6th districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| each have their say to provide their spice and flavor to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| and trust that the three at largest, one-third of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| can provide a cohesive, statesman-like view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| Next up, Emmett Lipschutz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5445)|
| 1:30:57| Hello, my name is Emmett Lipschutz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| I'm from District 1, zip code 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| Forgive me if my comments are a little unorganized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| but I have some serious concerns about this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| I think it's pretty undemocratic, but I'll start with some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| We've had a problem with representation in this country generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| for the past 200-plus years for a lot of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| But a big one, this might not make sense at first for me being opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| is our district system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| One representative can't represent everyone in one district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| There's a lot of different constituent groups based on age or race or even ideology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| Like in this city, people have a different vision for what the city should be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| in a given district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| So one person can't just represent all those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| But at the very least, in this country we at least, and in the city right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| kind of, and cities across the country, we at least have representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| for geographic groups, for groups of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| So that, say, there's a representative for different geographic areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| so the whole city won't just favor policies or a vision for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| that favors some groups, some areas of the city more than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| We at least have that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| But this proposal would get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| It would make all the representatives, all the council members elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| by everyone in the city, so that not even that constituent group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| not even that, those groups of neighborhoods would be represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| by a single council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| I think this is really based on a philosophy that a single representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| can be kind of like the best person or the best person that will always be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| to do the best deliberation, have the best interest for everyone in the city in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| And that just can't really be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| Knoxville is too big and too diverse of a society for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| We need different voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| I know that one point here is that council members will still have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| residency requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| I don't think that this is relevant at all because it should be the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| in the district who are electing the people who are meant to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| Another thing that was brought up in the workshop that was held last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| is the issue of cohesion, that having all of our council members elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| citywide would make the body less divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| I think this is a very undemocratic way of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| This is the same kind of thinking that could be used by military juntas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| or police states to, sorry to use extreme language there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| but this seems like an extremely wrong proposal to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| to justify their own undemocratic nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5624)|
| 1:34:00| I think if we're going to make a change, I understand that maybe changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| the system to be as little different as possible seems to be a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| for this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| I think the two options that are making both of the elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| the primary and the general citywide, are making them both in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| I think that changing them to be just the district voters is the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| democratic option, and I think that Ordinance 12C does a pretty good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5660)|
| 1:34:27| of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| I would really hope that you would vote for that, and if you feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| there are serious problems with that, I would really hope that with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| limited time that you have left that you could talk with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| and try to work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| Next speaker is Nzinga Amani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5688)|
| 1:34:58| My name is Nzinga Amani, 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| So before we touch on at large versus district voting, I just have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| I have to have some real talk with some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| I am in a united front with many of y'all up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Tommy, Andrew, Charlie, Debbie, Amelia, Seema, Gwen, Lauren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| I am in a united front with you against the oppressive, authoritarian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| and fascist forces that have overtaken the Republican Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| I understand your fear and want to exclude them from city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| but there is no guarantee the city will remain so blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| especially with population shifts and gentrification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| and this change could put us in violations of the Votings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| So we have an unfortunate choice between endorsing the political,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| temporary, democratic rule, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| or endorsing black representation in city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| Again, I understand the fear of the NAACP and local Democrats and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| progressives, and I understand the optimism of Reverend Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| but I am heavily disappointed by the willingness to cast aside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| gains of the civil rights movement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| the gains that you and your people fought for, brother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| and send our local democracy back 50 years and disenfranchise black voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| Now, of course, our districts and voting system is not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| Voter suppression and disenfranchisement already run rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| Folks who have records and don't have IDs can't vote, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| but nonetheless, we do not need to make things worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| So for some historical context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| I just Googled some history about this and, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| have some little snippets of some articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| In 1912, Knoxville changed its election system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| winnowing down the number of seats on council from 11 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| requiring candidates to run citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Before 1912, black council members were common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| The number of seats changed over the years, but after 1912,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| it was 57 years before a black person served again on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| In an interview with Bob Booker, he said, the late and great Bob Booker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| he said, the city changed the current system for the 1969 election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| Instead of requiring candidates to run citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| the city went to a district's primary system and added two seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| increasing council from seven to nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| That worked. Theodore Robertson, Jr., who was black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| was elected the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| But even so, the system was not equitable, Booker went on to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| It has resulted in black representation on council, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| but it allows the whiter, whites-majority city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| to decide which black candidate it prefers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| Because of this, he said, the city's election process should be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| Now, he was not saying to change it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| He was saying to change it deeper so black folks can have a voice in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| Who benefits from at-large and citywide races?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| West Knoxville, as was already eloquently demonstrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| will continue to have even a higher impact on candidates of all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| This further incentivizes candidates to prioritize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| the predominantly white, middle-class, and wealthier citizens of West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| over the interests of those in their own districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| It empowers developers, real estate businesses, corporations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| influential businesses, because they are the ones most able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| to bankroll large citywide campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| This rule entrenches the Democratic Party in the city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| for the immediate future, and it empowers both political parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| who have the resources to run citywide campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| at the expense of grassroots, working-class, and progressive candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| I don't want to hear our races are nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| We are all mature adults. We don't have to lie to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| Do we reverse the gains of the civil rights movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| and disenfranchise people of color, working-class communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| and grassroots candidates for temporary political gain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| or do we believe we can do better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| I urge you to vote against this and support Emily's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5932)|
| 1:39:02| Next up, Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| You thought we forgot you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5945)|
| 1:39:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| Rick Roach, 37917 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| I've watched here in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| things change in terms of representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| and watched how that has an effect on particular communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| and as Nzinga and others have brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| the fact that that's how you get things done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| that's how you shape the face of the city, the face of a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| and what we see going on now versus what I saw back in the 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=5992)|
| 1:40:00| and I'm against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| I was going to be for, but I'm against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| What we had was a tight community within East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| Yes, historically forced into that economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| but we survived, and we shaped it as best we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| with restrictive laws in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| You all know the history, if you care to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| Now, when I hear Reverend Middlebrook mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| integration versus desegregation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| well, that was a disempowerment move back in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Thoroughly disempowered African-Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| or people of African descent in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| Black folk, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| And that's what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| And so now, through all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| I've had white developers, real estate developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| give the lowdown, telling the truth, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| we're going to devalue a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| And the only way we can do that is through planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| which is as big a decision maker because they're appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| They're not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| And so the essence of a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| is literally sucked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| So we have no representation, true representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| I mean, if we're not disturbed by what Nzinga quoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| about how willy-nilly rules change in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| to control a particular population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| if we're not concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| if we don't want to fess up to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| well, you know, don't look at me because I talk crazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| and other people talk crazy and raise our voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| OK, we're not making it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| We know the effect that it's had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| And again, I'll use this because I know it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| Look at the effects every phase of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| we live in relationship to each other in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| If you go look at East Knoxville, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| 1990s, we had all kind of promises, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| All these millions of dollars coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| It hadn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| East Knoxville from right over here at Summit and Hall of Fame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| and going east, south of Magnolia, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| Yeah, big plans, baseball stadium, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| But the deal is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| There is no political power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| Sorry, Gwen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| We don't have any political power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| We don't in the 6th District, East Knoxville primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| and Mechanicsville-Monstell also, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| The gerrymandering of districts, I mean, 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| is literally a worm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| And what did you wrap around that 6th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| You wrapped around the 4th District, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| And some of the 5th District of which you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| unopposed representative twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| Once or once, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| So who ran against you the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| OK, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Excuse me, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| But you ran unopposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| Think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| In the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| And even Mark ran unopposed one time, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| So that means people ain't voting because they don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| they have to or they don't think it will do any good, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| So that might be a remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| But if you look at East Knoxville again, OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| the energy, the resources have been sucked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| And we have to play games about how much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| how many millions of dollars potentially will come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| and have an effect on this, on this particular community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| We have to play games with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| We can't come up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| You guys can't come up with a solidified plan to revitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| East Knoxville, which you have depleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| You have depleted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| Next person to sign up to speak is Deidre Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6260)|
| 1:44:30| Ms. Harper, will you come to the mic and say your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| You'll have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| After Ms. Harper is Emmanuel Bailey, followed by Jax Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6277)|
| 1:44:45| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| I'm Deidre Harper, District 6 and 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6287)|
| 1:44:54| So I did send an e-mail to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| and I only heard back from one particular council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| so I'm going to read the e-mail that I did send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Just to have it on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| as well as follow up with some additional comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| So I'm writing to express my concerns and submit a request regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| recent amendments presented at yesterday's city council workshop that I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| attend it, attend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| Following the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| I left with significant apprehension about the current and future direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| of our council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| particularly concerning council member Roberto's proposal on elections and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| its potential adverse impact on the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| Historical data has shown that citywide or at large elections are often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| detrimental to minority communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| And it is the council's responsibility to recognize and address these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| patterns and systems that negatively affect these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| This proposal presents an opportunity to use your influence and your vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| for the greater good and to counteract systemic racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| Previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| this council unanimously passed a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| acknowledging and working to rectify the wrongs of urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| Voting for council member Roberto's proposal will undermine these efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| Although the proposal may seem like a minor change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| its implications for communities of color are significant and harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| History and current events support this assertion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| While renaming the districts for clarity may simplify conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| The proposal does not address the confusion around the at large seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| which are identified by the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| The potential for confusion remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| The primary issue lies in the proposed change to the voting system for district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| This type of election system has historically been unfavorable for communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| resembling Knoxville sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| And furthermore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| the existence of at large representatives is intended to address citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| I urge the council to demonstrate bold leadership and prevent the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| establishment of oppressive systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| So with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| I had heard conversations because I did make phone calls and people did reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| out about where we were with this particular vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| And I heard that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| going citywide will make it easier for people to think about other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| But I think that that is not an accurate statement to be made because as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| district representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| it is your job to worry about your district and it's not to exclude other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| districts. However, because when you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| you do have to keep the whole city in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| So to say that just because your citywide will give you the opportunity or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| make you at all of a sudden feel like you're concerned about the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| I don't think that's accurate to say in a fair case to be made in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| particular dish in this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| Additionally, we talked about, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| I think that going to a citywide election will allow for more diversity on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| this particular council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| And it was mentioned that Amelia Parker council woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| Amelia Parker is, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| an example of being citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| but look how long it has taken for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| Additionally, we have a diverse council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| I heard that this is the most diverse council that we have ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| But when you think about some of the votes that's come across this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| specifically the baseball stadium diversity has not played an impact and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| played a part in really voting in favor of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| We have people come here and talk about having a community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| that was ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| That was something that could have been voted on to be a diverse council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| If that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| I don't think that is a fair statement to be made. And lastly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| I heard that will district six is changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| changing demographics and that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| But why is that district six does not have the resources that it needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| We've not had council representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| That's going to make sure that we have the resources that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| what we need in district six, that the voices of district six are being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| So I don't think that the arguments that are being raised and the reason for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| going to citywide election is in favorable to district six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| And I just really urge you to think about history. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| We could say there's a few times where citywide elections may have helped in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| this particular instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| but overall that may have been a few out of majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| And when you think about the majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| we have to think about our people and we have to think about district six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| voters. And that is where predominantly black voters are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| And that is in district six. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| I encourage you to think about this wisely to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| And really if you're about diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| if you're about protecting the black vote and making sure that district six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| has a representation that it needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| I think that you will vote against the proposal that is before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6585)|
| 1:49:52| Next up is Emmanuel Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| Emmanuel Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6594)|
| 1:50:05| I'm Emmanuel Bailey and I live at 3018 East Fifth Avenue here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| I'm a late entrant because I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| I'm opposed to this proposal primarily because I believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6618)|
| 1:50:29| neighborhoods. I believe in district representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| I know that you can have a lot more influence with people that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| who influences you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| The most valuable thing you probably have unless you're a business owner is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6644)|
| 1:50:52| your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| So you can depend on your neighbors to help you protect that because they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6655)|
| 1:51:03| in the same area that you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| It's the same kind of a process that should be used here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| We should respect each other through district representation because those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6672)|
| 1:51:20| the people that know and understand the needs of the people that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| represent. And you can put that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| I think all of you primarily are representing your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| Even the representatives that we elect at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6693)|
| 1:51:40| We're certainly concerned about the city, but everybody doesn't get the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| kind of access, opportunity, education, and access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6706)|
| 1:51:52| And the better way to try to broach this thing about power is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| continue to allow neighborhoods, districts, to be seats of the influences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6717)|
| 1:52:10| necessary to run our city. Because those are the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| understand it. You drive a particular route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| I had a friend that was at the university and he did what he called mental map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| experiences. And what he found out is most people only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| travel 30 blocks. How big of an area is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6751)|
| 1:52:41| That's what you know. Those are the issues that you can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| familiar with and that people can influence you regarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| And that's why the system in terms of district representation logically should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| be kind of seated around that. And the rest of the members should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| respect that. Because none of us know everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| How many of you know me? What do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| Do you know the businesses I own, the property I own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| No, you have no idea about it. So all I'm saying is that's the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| way to use this system. And we ought to try and do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| We understand that there are things that are being imposed from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| But they still can be seated around district representation as the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6812)|
| 1:53:41| issue. That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| The final speaker is Jax Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6827)|
| 1:53:57| Hello, council. My name is Jax Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| I live in the Norwood neighborhood in District 3, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| And I'm here to speak against Proposal B because I've lived all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| Knoxville. I am from a nearby town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| I moved here for college and I've lived in different areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| And they have different concerns, but they do work towards the same goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| But there are different people that live in different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Like I'm not going to speak to District 6 because I've never lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| But I currently, like I said, live in District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| And there is a wide variety of people living in that area of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| And I just find that this feels like trying to cling to the old system that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| we've had, which honestly is very confusing for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| I regularly am explaining to people my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| I'm in my early 30s and younger about how like city elections work and who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| they can vote for at what times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| And honestly, it's pretty difficult for a lot of people to want to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| and vet so many people and feel confident about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| And it actually, from my personal experience, I've seen people decide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| they shouldn't vote because they're so concerned about voting for the wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| person. And I really feel everyone who's spoken before me has raised very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6926)|
| 1:55:32| good points, especially about how different each neighborhood can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| And I think focusing from instead of focusing at making everything at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| making it more districted will allow people who are running for office to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| focus more on what their district is actually trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| And I think a lot of districts are wanting similar things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| You know, they want to protect the character of their neighborhood while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| still having economic opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| But it's a challenge that different areas of the city have had different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| opportunity over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| So I think that going completely at large may homogenize city council in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| way that would not be helpful for citizens of many districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| I'm just really hoping that y'all think a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| I know people were talking about feeling that it was rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| I don't know how long y'all have to change the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| And I'm curious of what would happen if people rejected what's on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| whichever one you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| So I think taking the time to realize that I know that you guys are not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| this flippantly. And again, it's from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| But this is a chance to write a lot of issues that have come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| elections over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| So people are watching and they're really hoping that it continues to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7018)|
| 1:57:07| they feel heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| And I think having a more districted approach rather than at large would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| definitely help people feel more seen and heard and have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| being able to be like, I'm X number of constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| And as it was said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| I don't get to vote for the other state representative districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| And they still are bringing money that back to Knoxville that affect me or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| not bringing money back to Knoxville in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| So, yeah, that's, it's hard to be concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| Everyone has been such a wonderful speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| but just being concerned at the impacts that might happen and switching to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| completely at large rather than making sure that individual areas of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| get individualized representation. Because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| I think it's best when honestly some city council members disagree because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| have to be able to have people who look at everything from all angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| It's being able to disagree and then work together is what's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| So I think making it at large runs too much of a risk of homogenization for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| every seat. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| Okay. That's it for the people that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| And now council will deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| We will start with councilman Roberto who drafted this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| So councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| Thank you, vice mayor. After a change in state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| our election process is no longer consistent with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7116)|
| 1:58:42| And as such council's considering ways to bring our charter into line with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| The sole purpose of this charter amendment is to preserve the right of every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| Knoxville voter to vote on all nine members of their city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7135)|
| 1:59:01| So I'm addressing that to the 105,020 registered voters in the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| The alternative district only approach will mean that every voter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| no matter where you live in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| will no longer be able to vote for all nine members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| Instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| every voter will only get to vote for their specific district representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| and the three at large members of council only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| You're going to go from a process where you stepped into the ballot box last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| and you got to vote for nine people and you're going to go down to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| That means that a majority of council will no longer be accountable to every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| This also means that as few as 500 voters could determine who is on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7190)|
| 1:59:57| And remember that council makes decisions that affect our entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| Dividing up council into districts only invites gerrymandering into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7202)|
| 2:00:08| And I don't want to see politicians picking who they want to vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| I want to keep council accountable to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| Ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| I want this to be a choice for the voters and let them make a decision about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| whether or not they want district only or they want the hybrid at large option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7224)|
| 2:00:32| I'm not going to cast a vote to disenfranchise every voter and reduce them from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| voting from nine votes on council to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| I think that this decision is for all of the voters to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| The folks in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| the folks in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| we need to make sure that all of the registered voters have the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| make that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| And that's what this vote is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| It doesn't enact this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| It gives people a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| Council has received support from Reverend Middlebrook this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| as well as from the NAACP to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| And I just wanted to read one of the paragraphs from the open letter that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7272)|
| 2:01:18| NAACP Knoxville branch put out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| It is with this premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| Knoxville NAACP strongly encourages city council to support agenda item 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7283)|
| 2:01:30| The voters in the city of Knoxville must use their voice to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| Moreover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| to improve voter education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| Knoxville NAACP is committed to facilitating public forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| and information dissemination to equip voters to make informed decisions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| our democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| We welcome you to join us in this task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| As we know together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| our democracy is greater and I'm committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| And I think all council members will be committed to working with any group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7313)|
| 2:01:58| the NAACP or any other group and hold information centers so that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| or information dialogues so that the voters are educated and can make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| And that's what I think we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| I'm going to close just with a quote from Theotis Robinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7331)|
| 2:02:16| an opinion piece that he wrote back in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7336)|
| 2:02:22| This is just one of the paragraphs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| There is talk claiming that white voters have veto power over who serves on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| city council from district six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| but the same can be said conversely that voters in that district have veto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| power over the other five districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| I'm no mathematical genius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| but I understand that on a nine member council five constitutes a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| If the system changes to district only election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| a majority on council will never have to campaign for a single vote from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| residents living outside their districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| A majority on the council could never be held accountable for their actions by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| voters from any district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| And I can't say it better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| look for lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| So I'm going to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7402)|
| 2:03:25| there's a lot of elephants in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| I feel like there's a couple of different comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| There's a lot of really wonderful comments that were made and I can sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| here and think in pros and cons to every system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| And I feel like the system that we had or happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| we're going to have to say had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| because it's fast sense has worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7424)|
| 2:03:50| And I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| so one of the comments made was why didn't we get ahead of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| So I'm just going to be real blatant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| We went to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| we sat down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| we had a conversation face to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| Hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| why are you proposing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| Why are you sponsoring this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| Why is this on the state legislature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| Our charter reads that we're home rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| This is for our voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| whether you agree with me or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| this is for our voters to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| It's not for people not here to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| So after that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| the person who I actually get to vote for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| I'm going to leave titles and names out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| Somebody I can touch at the ballot box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| They said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| Hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| we're going to have a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| We're going to put this to our voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| Let's let our voters decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| You guys decided that this wasn't fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| You decided to put something on the state ledge to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| but we think that this is a discussion for the locals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| This is for our local folks to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| That's how we decided how we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| So we were going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| You're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| So what then happened as things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| this goes to the question of we don't get to vote on every representative that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| goes to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| We don't get to vote for every representative goes to Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| DC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| So what they did is they got somebody that we can't touch at the ballot box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| to put their name on it and bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| So the person who that I can vote for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| they're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| cool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| I promised you I wasn't going to bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| I'm going to get my buddy in another county that doesn't even have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| to do with your jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| They'll put their name on it and we'll run around and we'll whip the votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| along the party lines and pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| And that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| So we did try to get ahead of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| And we had a very good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| And it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| we're going to come back and we're going to put this to you guys and let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| you vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Have a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| come up with different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| be more ahead of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| And so they decided that's not how they want to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| So that's why we find ourselves the way we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| We don't get to make this choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| And I'll be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| if I had run citywide the first time in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7575)|
| 2:06:21| I probably wouldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| I won my district because I was well-known and very involved in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| I'm not sure what's proposed is the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| I'm not putting it into the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| If we vote on it tonight and pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| whichever we put is what we put on the ballot for everyone to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| which is what we told the state legislators we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| We want our citizens to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| It's infuriating when someone betrays you like that and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| yeah, OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| take this back and you guys decide amongst your own people how you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| And then they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7617)|
| 2:06:58| they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| they change and betray you because that's how it felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| So anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| I'm going to let my colleagues speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| That's all I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| But that's what happens when you don't get to vote on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| They do things that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| they'll just do whatever to you because you can't touch them at the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| And that's part of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| And the other thing I'll say is when I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| long before I was on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7646)|
| 2:07:27| I was involved in neighborhood stuff and we would go to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| and I'm not trying to knock county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| but they and school board are organized differently than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| And you would go and there would be people there and they saw your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| You couldn't touch them at the ballot box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| They didn't care what you thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| And they would vote on things and decide to maybe concentrate services or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| different things in different parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| And they could rally up the votes against the one that did represent you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7676)|
| 2:08:03| because they saw fit that certain parts of town should be certain ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| And they don't have to come and meet you and come to your neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| They don't have to knock in the doors in your area and hear what you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| to say and how your district and what your community wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| And that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| then the votes often portray that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| And so that's why I think the system we've had has been a better system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| but we're not allowed to have it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| thank you vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| I have several concerns about this proposal, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7720)|
| 2:08:45| which is why I brought my own proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7725)|
| 2:08:51| But let me start here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| I'm hearing the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| the chorus of voices who are stating that they want to give voters a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7735)|
| 2:09:04| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| what I'm hearing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| a choice between Roberto's proposal or nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| with the assumption that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| if they take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| it's the same as passing my ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| which is not true on most in multiple ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| And I'll talk about my ordinance next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| But what I want to speak to on that issue is how I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| I think that's an unfortunate process for us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| I believe that's confusing for the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| And I believe anytime the city council puts an ordinance forward for a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| the city often puts money behind promoting that ordinance option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| that potential charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| It becomes confusing for voters and it could easily become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| something that they feel council supports and wants them to support rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7810)|
| 2:10:16| than it be something that council is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| I'm not taking a strong position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| I want to hear from the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| I think what goes on the ballot from city council as a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7823)|
| 2:10:28| is seen as an endorsement of the process that council wants to see take hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7828)|
| 2:10:35| now that the state law has been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7835)|
| 2:10:36| So I do think that's a bit disingenuous and council members should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7836)|
| 2:10:43| should either, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| own their position that they feel we should go at large to a full at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| And that's why they're backing it or not because it's going to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| confusing for voters on the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| The main issue that brings me pause when I read the resolute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| read the ordinance was shifting our elections to an all at large system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7869)|
| 2:11:18| You know, my background, I have a legal background, a master's of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| I have interned at multiple civil rights organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7884)|
| 2:11:30| including the premier civil rights organizations that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| that fights for the voting rights act year after year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| and at large systems have consistently been questioned since the passage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7900)|
| 2:11:50| the voting rights act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| In cities like ours in cities like Knoxville that have a significant racial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7913)|
| 2:12:00| minority population, we have a significant black population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| We have a majority minority district where we can see a significant number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7924)|
| 2:12:11| our black population living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7931)|
| 2:12:17| We tend to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| a voting pattern that comes out of that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| All of these identify a majority minority district that must be protected and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7946)|
| 2:12:33| the voting rights act not only requires us to protect it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| but when we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| factors taking place in our community that can lead to the dilution of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7961)|
| 2:12:49| minority vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| it's actually our responsibility to look at redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| to read, to restrengthen that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| It's not our job to say, Oh, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| the city's changing the voting rights act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| We've elected one person at large in the last 147 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| one person of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| We can get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| No, actually there it within the voting rights act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| it calls upon us to look at how we can strengthen that district through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=7997)|
| 2:13:23| redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| We can get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| We can get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| We can get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| We can get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| We can get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| So we need to look at how we can strengthen that district through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| redistricting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| Was that five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| You're on the roll, but I'm going to have to pass the mic and come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| This, this is a struggle for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| It is interesting that the Republican majority of the state and civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8037)|
| 2:14:07| activists are advocating for district only elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| I do think there is a real, I mean, that's what I heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| Lots of people who spoke like the district only and there's merit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| I can't tell you today exactly how I feel about either one of these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8061)|
| 2:14:31| As I said at the workshop, I liked the way we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| I liked a district picking the top two people they liked out of their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8076)|
| 2:14:44| and everybody running citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| I think that has given us a pretty good governance model for the last 50 some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8088)|
| 2:14:56| odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| I also think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| people's motives can be questioned for why they want the changes that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| And you can find a pro and con and unintended consequences with every way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8106)|
| 2:15:11| vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| As we see in our city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| our city tends to vote ideologically more one way than our county at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| One of the concerns that you can get by citywide or countywide for lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8124)|
| 2:15:32| things, if it were that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| is that ideological minorities that live in certain parts of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8133)|
| 2:15:39| won't have a voice either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| And I think that's part of what some people were concerned about at the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| If we're just saying it like it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| I think that was the motive behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| So I think lots of people can feel not represented by citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8152)|
| 2:16:00| I put my name on this a couple of weeks ago and I have struggled with it ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| since because I too am torn about both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8164)|
| 2:16:12| But in the absence of putting something forward that lets people vote about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8172)|
| 2:16:21| keeping the ability to vote for every city council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8181)|
| 2:16:26| we will get, we don't have to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| We don't have to do anything and we will get district only starting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| That's a fact. We don't have to do a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| We'll get district only and three at large seats so we don't have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| I'm not going to really question the motives of my colleagues for why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8206)|
| 2:16:51| feel the way they feel because I think everybody that serves on this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8211)|
| 2:16:56| council loves this city and wants what's best for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| But robust dialogue is what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| I think, I mean talk to me 30 minutes ago and I didn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8226)|
| 2:17:12| the more we talk because my colleagues make very good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| Our citizens make very good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| This is not to be entered into lightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8237)|
| 2:17:21| but if we don't put something on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| we have no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| If this were to go on the ballot or something like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| there is from August to November to have robust community discussion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8253)|
| 2:17:41| education and let people make a choice, which as my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| Councilwoman Ryder said, is what we went to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| I went on that city representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| I went on that trip to Nashville too and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| I'm not going to tell you which one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| whether the way we vote is right or the way you're proposing is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| but we are a home rule charter and I think the citizens of the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| Knoxville are the best people to decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| So I think everybody has made wonderful points and depending upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8290)|
| 2:18:18| the last thing I heard as of today, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| who knows how I personally would go in the ballot box and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8301)|
| 2:18:27| But I think if in supporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8307)|
| 2:18:33| I think it's about giving people a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| I don't disagree with Councilwoman Parker that if the city council puts it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| people will think that it's a unanimous and it's what we think they ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| do, but it's incumbent upon us to make sure people talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| I don't know that I cleared anything up and my time is up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| but I'm just trying to say this is hard and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| Thank you. Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| Mr. Frost, quick question before I get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8341)|
| 2:19:05| So the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| the two agenda items that are before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| is this an either or proposition for us to vote for or could both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| potentially be on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| Well, first right now we only have one thing in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| We have Councilmember Parker's proposal next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| but we had Councilmember Thomas's also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8366)|
| 2:19:33| I'm a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| we'd have to reconcile Mr. Thomas's proposal is going to change the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| for the fifth district time and I'm not sure how that's going to interplay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| with Councilmember Parker's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| But as a Councilmember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| I can't wait to reach out to the Tennessee bar. I can't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| As a Councilmember Puget said, you know, we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| even if council does not act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| we are going to have a change despite what the charter says based on what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| state does. What Councilmember Roberto and Councilmember Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| they both call for a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| if an at large member receives 50% plus one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| that will be decided in the primary. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| Councilmember Parker's proposal does not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| And she of course can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| does not have that for the district representatives where they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| continue to run in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| So we do have a little potential conflict right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8444)|
| 2:20:50| I believe that's, that might be the only conflict I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| So if I hear you correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| you're saying that in Councilmember Parker's hers is 50% plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| You don't have to run again for at large only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| At large only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8466)|
| 2:21:13| Right. So could both of these potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| well all three be on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| Well, if all three are on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| I think there's a potential if all three are on the ballot and all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8480)|
| 2:21:25| pass, I think there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| there could be some issues because of the differences between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8488)|
| 2:21:35| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| who all the 50% plus one applies to or does not apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| And I don't know about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| I hadn't thought about the interplay of Councilmember Thomas's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| about changing the cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| So can we have that conversation? I guess maybe when we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| get to that agenda item with Ms. Parker. Okay. And very, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8517)|
| 2:22:02| So very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| So we were talking about history and we're talking about numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| I want to give some, some statistics around the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| So the demographic that makes up the sixth district is not reflective of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8530)|
| 2:22:15| ballot box typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| So currently there are 14,966 registered voters in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8537)|
| 2:22:23| In 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| the sixth district had 13 people running for city council seat and those 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| people, we split 1,412 votes in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| I walked away with 22.24% of the votes in Jennifer Montgomery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| 17.28% of the vote. We went citywide at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| citywide voter turnout for the sixth district was 10,564 votes citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8565)|
| 2:22:52| I got 57.97%. Ms. Montgomery got 42.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| Fast forward to 2021. While the city elections are nonpartisan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| there was a concerted effort by the Republican party to make them partisan in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| 2021, where they were attacking all five of the incumbent seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| I actually found it in one of their smear campaigns that I was a white| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| supremacist. Who knew? In that race, there were three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8595)|
| 2:23:20| There was myself, Mr. Holt and Deidre Harper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| who spoke to us earlier. In that election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| there were 1,670 votes cast amongst the three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8611)|
| 2:23:38| There are 11 districts in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| I won seven of those districts. Mr. Holt won four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| This split was 52%, 25% and 22%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8626)|
| 2:23:52| When we went citywide, 20,829 people came out to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8632)|
| 2:23:58| We split that between myself and he at 57.53 and 42.47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8638)|
| 2:24:04| So I am of the strong belief that based on the results of the sixth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| election in 2021 was the catalyst for the change in the state law to have us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8648)|
| 2:24:16| go district only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| Keep those numbers in mind and that there are 2,400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8658)|
| 2:24:22| an estimate of around 2,400 people who live downtown in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| We didn't even get that number of votes in our district election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8667)|
| 2:24:33| So I want us to be really, really clear on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8673)|
| 2:24:37| I think either way we slice it, keep it in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| we're still in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| We're still in jeopardy because of such low voter turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| And I know that a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8688)|
| 2:24:50| we want folks to be excited about elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| be informed about elections, but this is difficult because again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| I don't want us to be disillusioned to think that in the sixth district that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| minority could lose this race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| because that is absolutely a possibility because of the demographics and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| low voter turnout. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| Mr. Frost. Thank you. I'm going to take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| I just wanted a very important part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| I totally forgot when I was trying to run through my mind on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8719)|
| 2:25:23| the differences between Council Member Roberto's and Council Member Parker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| proposal. Councilman Roberto's proposal is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8728)|
| 2:25:34| the regional district representatives would be on the ballot at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| be voted on citywide in both cases. Council Member Parker does not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| So there's a conflict between the two in those proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8745)|
| 2:25:53| Thank you. Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| Some of my concerns mirror Councilwoman McKenzie's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| I feel a little bit in an awkward position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| I don't know how many minority council members have ever been elected and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8768)|
| 2:26:14| voted outside of the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8774)|
| 2:26:21| Besides your race at large, but like in a different district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| In this first district, has there been a minority? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| In the third district, me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| And if we change this to a district by district, there is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| My daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| There is no way that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8800)|
| 2:26:47| I could have won, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| There would not have been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| What my ethnic minority is reflected in the city of Knoxville is like .001%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8812)|
| 2:26:58| There are a lot of people who ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| how can you represent us? You don't look like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| I'm like, well, white men have represented me for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| and I'm going to give it the same try to represent everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| But that is a place where...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| I don't want to do anything. This is a really hard decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| I don't want to do anything that moves us towards any more systemic racism at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8838)|
| 2:27:24| That's where I am worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| Which direction is this going to push this in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| And I'll wrap it up by saying my concerns are similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| Councilmember McKenzie's, that I'm not even sure that the sixth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8853)|
| 2:27:40| may or may not vote in a minority representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8860)|
| 2:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| I know I have limited time and lots to say, but I have to reiterate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8873)|
| 2:27:58| when it comes to protecting the minority vote and minority representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8878)|
| 2:28:04| we can be proactive and we shouldn't feel so powerless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| as city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| If we see districts shifting, we can actually do some redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| to protect that minority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| In response to the district third example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8898)|
| 2:28:23| since I campaigned hard in 2017 in that race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8903)|
| 2:28:30| and helped build the movement to run more diverse slate of candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8910)|
| 2:28:36| I can tell you, it is the hard work of very intentional people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8916)|
| 2:28:43| that has produced the diversity that you see on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8923)|
| 2:28:48| It hasn't just been a wide awakening that has just taken hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8928)|
| 2:28:55| and gone throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| It has been knocking on doors, talking to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| and saying, will you vote for Seema Singh Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| which is what it was at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| and them not being able to repeat the name back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| We all know Seema now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| We all have to say that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| But when I was knocking on doors, I have to just speak for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| in 2017, people couldn't pronounce the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| felt embarrassed to even try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| So getting a mind of diverse leadership in place in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| we built a movement so that we could have the back of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| so that people would even consider running in a District 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| that we knew was a more conservative district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| I think you would have won in a district-only general in District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8977)|
| 2:29:44| We put in the work to get you through the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| There were not only two candidates in the District 3 primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| There were other people in that election with bigger names in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| that we, you know, we threw our support behind Seema| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| and knocked them out of the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| And I'm sure that we could have brought about that victory in the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9007)|
| 2:30:12| But with those types of elections, it takes more time because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| and it's going to be easier, it would be easier in a district-only election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| because a district understands that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| it is their job to elect that representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| When a district race goes citywide, then the conversation becomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9026)|
| 2:30:33| well, I like that person, but can they win citywide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| Well, that's a, you know, they really represent what I'm feeling here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9037)|
| 2:30:44| but I don't think they have a chance at the city level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| So there's so many people who do not even run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| because they know they're not going to get that support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9051)|
| 2:30:54| or they believe they're not going to get that support to run at the citywide level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9054)|
| 2:30:59| I think it definitely impacts our elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| I believe, I agree with the words of the late, great Dr. Booker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9063)|
| 2:31:12| who also felt that our white majority districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9072)|
| 2:31:17| had an overwhelming influence in our elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9077)|
| 2:31:21| and also helped prevent, our structure of our elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| helped prevent some really good candidates running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9086)|
| 2:31:30| who might have run if they were running in a district-only race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9090)|
| 2:31:36| So I, I just want, I don't have much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9096)|
| 2:31:46| and I don't think I can make my case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| in one evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| I really think that this is an issue that does take more time and consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| even multiple workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| to dig into what the courts have said about the Voting Rights Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9121)|
| 2:32:08| what our job and responsibility is when it comes to redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9128)|
| 2:32:13| You know, I regret that we did not spend more time on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9133)|
| 2:32:18| when it came before, redistricting came before us recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9138)|
| 2:32:25| But it'll be back around very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| And I believe that we need to get ready for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| and help our residents throughout this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| understand the importance of the Voting Rights Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| and help us maintain the principles here in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| Not throw them away because we elected one black person to an at-large seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9171)|
| 2:32:58| Thanks, I just wanted to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| I have, I've run four times in District 3 in a sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| in the primaries and then the general, the people who came out from District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| And this is, I have only won the third district one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| So if people really want to, just in the second primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9196)|
| 2:33:21| the first primary I did not win, the second general I did not win in the third district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9201)|
| 2:33:26| the third primary, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| My point is, I would not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| Once again, it's not about me, it's about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| I mean, if we really wanted to start saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| I see a point where people in the third district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| may not feel that I am their proper representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| I see that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| I'm still glad to be here though, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| And to that point, Councilwoman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9235)|
| 2:33:58| I've been looking at these numbers for the last couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9238)|
| 2:34:01| So in District 3, there were four people that split 792 votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9241)|
| 2:34:07| and Cochran had 47.60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| and Councilwoman Singh had 25.13 in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| Citywide, the two of you split 10,579 votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| and you came out with 57.73 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9261)|
| 2:34:25| because of the citywide vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9265)|
| 2:34:28| So if we would equate that, what would that have looked like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| the two of you running against each other again in the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| And so, again, I think that we find ourselves in a precarious situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9274)|
| 2:34:40| and at this point, you know, there's a lot to consider here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9280)|
| 2:34:45| a lot to consider here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| So, what Councilwoman McKenzie just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9292)|
| 2:35:00| to Councilwoman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| you did not win in your district, you won citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9303)|
| 2:35:10| Correct, Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| So you're a minority that won citywide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| A minority in the city of Knoxville wins citywide every two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9322)|
| 2:35:26| in the district races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9326)|
| 2:35:32| But the issue is how that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9332)|
| 2:35:39| I need Dr. Booker here to provide me cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| and give me the language that I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| that politicians don't usually really use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| But if you go back to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| I did a lot of research getting ready for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9353)|
| 2:35:56| And if you go back to the news articles from the late 1960s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9356)|
| 2:36:02| the conversation was very similar to the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9362)|
| 2:36:06| that we're having right now, which is interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| But they were moving from a purely at-large system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| to the district system that we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| A lot of folks felt like they were losing their right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| to select the full city council, moving to the district system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9381)|
| 2:36:27| And so this hybrid system is what they landed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9387)|
| 2:36:34| which would allow the district to nominate their candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9394)|
| 2:36:38| and then the full city decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| But as Dr. Booker has mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9400)|
| 2:36:50| that may have had a negative impact on our elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| And the only way for us to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| is if an individual brings a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| under the Voting Rights Act against our election system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| And I'm assuming that hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| Over the last 50 years, I was talking to some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| as I was preparing for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| who said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9433)|
| 2:37:16| if the city adopts an at-large system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| and it goes a certain direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9440)|
| 2:37:23| I'll be ready to put my own personal resources forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| to bring a lawsuit against the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| But this is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| It's not somebody who's a minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| But this person is not someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9456)|
| 2:37:39| who lives in the majority-minority district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| It's not somebody who's a racial minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| Those who are going to be directly impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| are those in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9469)|
| 2:37:52| that are facing the disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9472)|
| 2:37:55| that a community that doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9475)|
| 2:37:58| the resources needed to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| civil rights lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| as often as they need to be brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| What I'm committed to and where I'm at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| is I want to put good policy forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| I don't want to put policy forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| that could potentially disenfranchise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| our minority voters, but we're going to wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| And we're going to put it in the hands of those minority voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| to have to bring that civil rights challenge against us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| if that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| I want us to be on the front end of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| look at the 50 years of history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| not think that we, Knoxville, are exceptional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9521)|
| 2:38:44| that we somehow, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| do not need to have structures and considerations in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=9527)|
