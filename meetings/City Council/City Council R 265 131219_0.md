| 0:02:29| The ayes have it, and the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| For the mayor's report, I wanna apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| for not being here at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| I tried to get back in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| but it was snowed in in Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| after being at the President's Task Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| for Climate Preparedness and Resilience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| And actually, we weren't snowed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| The plane was snowed in wherever it was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| So one thing led to another, and I got in about 10.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| and I understand that I almost could've made it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| But anyway, thank Vice Mayor Pavlis for chairing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| I wanna remind everybody that the city offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| will be closed on December 25th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| and on January 1st for the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| We do wish everyone a very Merry Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| and a Happy New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| I know that council's aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| but I wanna remind the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| that this Saturday at 10 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| we will have the swearing-in ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| for our five recently re-elected city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| The ceremony will be right here in the main assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| with the reception afterward next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| Then at 11.30 that morning, we will convene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| a council meeting, special called council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| which will elect the officers, the vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| the beer board chair, and the representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| to Knoxville Transportation Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| So I'm looking forward to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=230)|
| 0:03:50| and I'm sure you all are too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| And I think the five of you who were re-elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| have a lot to be proud of from the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| and really look forward to, well, I hope I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| four more years to work with you as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| but we know at least two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| I also wanna mention that we had a great event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| in Lonsdale this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| There was a groundbreaking ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| for two new affordable houses that will be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| on Bishop Street by the East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Housing Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| A few of our council members were there with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| And you probably remember that ETHDC has already built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| three new energy-efficient homes on that same street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| and they have plans for more, actually, in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| They've built a couple others in Lonsdale already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| So like the other houses, these two new ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| will be available to qualified, low-income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| first-time home buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| And this is something that's funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| through community development funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| through our federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| so we're glad to be partners with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Appreciate Becky Wade and all of her staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| and the board and staff at ETHDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| I want to remind you that we will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| a New Year's Eve ball drop on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| This is organized by our special events office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| and it's kind of the capstone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| of our Christmas in the City events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| We will have a countdown on the stage there at the square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| and the skating rink will stay open all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| so you can ice skate while you're waiting for the New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| Market Square is really festive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| and it's a family-friendly place on New Year's Eve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| so I encourage everybody to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| And for my last item, I want to call on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=330)|

| 0:06:15| for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| We've worked together very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| And I can't thank him enough for all he's done for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| for this Fire Department, and for this city especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| And all those of you who've been around for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| you know many of the things he's done for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| but none of us really know all the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| that he's done for this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| So, Roger, again, I want to thank you for all you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| and I want to congratulate you for your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| And I know you'll enjoy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| but I do have his phone number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| and I will be calling him regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| He's welcome to come to any future Council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| When Harriet says, really, get out of the house, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| Now, I want to just add before you say anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| we had a little reception yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| and honored our Deputy Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| And there was a big crowd and a lot of family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| I mean, he's got a big family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| and they all came out to support him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| And I also want to add my thanks and appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| for everything that you've done for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| I appreciate the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| working as closely with you as we did in this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| and I appreciate all that you've done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| Mayor, I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Okay, Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| No, listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=450)|
| 0:07:30| Burning me, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Now I get to turn this around, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| No, I tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Roger has really been a great help to the building industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| and really a fantastic fire marshal for the architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| He's always looked for a way to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| And he's not one of these guys that shuts the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| and says, you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| He really rolls up his sleeves and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| well, how can we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| And maybe we can do it this way or that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| And I've been with Roger out on a number of job sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| right, some that we didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| weren't sure what they were going to turn out as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| But so on behalf of the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| and the building industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=485)|
| 0:08:05| we really want to thank you and you will be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| So, but thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| You're a great friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| I think we should present him with a Dalmatian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| or something, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Well, he was presented with a nice shadow box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=495)|
| 0:08:31| with his badge and what else did you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| in there, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| His badge and a little plaque| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| that stated the years that he was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| and thanking him for his loyal service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| and a little KFD medallion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| And yesterday was Deputy Chief Roger Bird Day in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| So proclaimed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| And it has been my pleasure to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Met a lot of good people along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| and learned from a lot of good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| And it's just been a great time for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| and I've never hated a day to get up and come to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| and still don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Just time to move on to the next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| So again, thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you, Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| Any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=564)|

| 0:09:37| to that date as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| It's on the proposed sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| February the 27th, there's gonna be a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| I'm not exactly sure it's gonna be two or just one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| but we definitely will be discussing the homelessness plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| And then perhaps in that same meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| we'll be meeting with the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| on the Innovation Valley Economic Development Activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=601)|

| 0:10:42| to go ahead and please get those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| We only meet a couple times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| So it's February 6th, so there's still plenty of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| to get in applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| of Sheila Wittke and Jim Idle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| to the Board of Directors of Community Television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=664)|

| 0:11:08| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Before, I just want you all to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| there are no ordinances on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| because you have to have a 14 day gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| or delay from first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| And so since this is an earlier meeting, that won't occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| So anything that should be on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| will be on our next Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=685)|

| 0:11:49| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Oh, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| I just want to say that that's in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| and I want to thank Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| And as the representative to CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| we've been working on getting that stop there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| or that shelter there for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| So it's much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| And we really want to thank Mr. Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| for making it possible for us to have that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Your Council shares in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=743)|

| 0:13:33| but I'd like to make a couple amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Okay, Council, we have three people who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Would you like to hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| Wouldn't it be helpful to know the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| since they might be addressing the very same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| we're gonna talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Is this the exemptions, the amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| It has to do with the exemptions originally requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| and a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| So, Councilman Campin, would you like to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| and make those and then hear from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| or do you wanna hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| It might help the speakers to know what we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Well, I mean, who's signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| We have Nancy Webb, Betty Jo, how do you, Mahan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| And Anita Case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Only if they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Okay, so we'll go ahead and make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| and then remind me, we'll take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| and see if you feel the need to come up, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Okay, so did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=873)|
| 0:14:33| Okay, we need a second on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| The first amendment, again, this includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| the original six requested excluded properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| And then amend it with 24 more properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| These would include all the medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| residential properties that were discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| at last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| I believe you may have gotten an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| including parcels to remain R2 from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| that explains those MDR properties in the original six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| The other, the three that weren't a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| there's 4511 Bruin Road, a duplex that's owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| by Mr. Leavitt requested exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| Miss Rachel John had two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| on Sylvia Drive, 206 and 214.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| And that totals, I believe, 30 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| That's the first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| Okay, is there a second to that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| I'm sorry, I just want to make it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| that this amendment really doesn't amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| those original six parcels of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| that were excluded because they were excluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| at the MPC phase and did not come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| with a recommendation for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Those are already exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| And so what you're really doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| is all those other parcels other than those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| that were previously exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Correct, I was just trying to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Sorry. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=964)|
| 0:16:04| Okay, so Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| I wonder if he could list the six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| that did not come up that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| that we would know from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Oh, sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| I think I've got them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| This is, it's actually, well, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| yeah, there's six are 4901 Costa Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| 4821 Costa Road, 314 East Enskip Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| 806 East Enskip Drive, 606 Glen Oaks Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| 160 Sylvia Drive, and I believe that's the six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| I've passed, Mrs. Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| a copy of the list of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Okay, and I'll submit this also for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| that has those other three that I was amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| to be included in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Okay, so that's the first amendment that we will vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Did any of the folks who signed up want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| Okay, we're fine on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Okay, so you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Oh, Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| I'd like to, clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| seems to me when we ended this discussion last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| the question was what would we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| with the ones that remained R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| and we were debating between just leaving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| as is without conditions or adding a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| that related to a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| I would support just leaving them as R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| and not adding anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| That's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Okay, I just wanted that for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Okay, you ready to vote on this first amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1064)|
| 0:17:44| That first amendment passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| and now for your second amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| The second amendment's just to pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| You know, this is a big undertaking for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| and between now and the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| again, you know, drawing the line in the sand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| we gotta make a decision at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| We could have many more properties come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| and I think it's in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| of the community and the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Okay, any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Councilman Delvapi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| I don't have a problem with the emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| but I'm still a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| There was another name that I don't think you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| It was the Borden, was it Phil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| Sent you an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Mr. Levitt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| No, but before Mr. Levitt, there was another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| They were up in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| and there was an 88-year-old woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131219?start=1108)|
