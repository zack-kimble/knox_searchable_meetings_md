| 0:01:16| seek to serve this community as best we can. We can't do this without your help so we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| your help to do that and make good decisions and give you honor. Amen. Amen. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| Bailey would you lead us in the pledge? Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=94)|
| 0:01:41| with liberty and justice for all. This will be the final meeting of these two bodies with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=101)|
| 0:01:50| Mr. Joyner. And so Mr. Joyner I would like for you to come forward and first thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| for your service and to your staff. This has been very helpful and we appreciate the hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| work that you have put in and for leading us in these discussions. So the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you. What I really like is the last time I'm here I've noticed there's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| be a test because I have the commissioners and the council kind of mixed in together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| so I will call somebody by the wrong title at least once. Let's clarify that. I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| about getting a little dot you can put on your forehead yellow or red. It wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| Thank you for having me. It's been a great experience for both Phyllis and I. We want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| to thank you for the opportunity to be a part of this discussion. Being invited into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| city and county of Knox County and Knoxville to help facilitate this conversation. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| be honest, I've done this kind of work before. Sometimes when you're in the midst of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| it's hard to kind of see the tremendous progress that you guys have been making. I'm telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| you after watching groups work before I'm very, very pleased by how much positive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| and progress has been made. We came into a situation I think all of us would say was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| a little bit competitive. Perhaps the best communication wasn't flowing. Perhaps there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| was some tension there. I've watched over the matter of weeks of the courtesy of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| good process you've used. Even the last week starting to see creativity starting to bubble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| up of people who are saying there's ways we can do this, ways we can make this work. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| only happens when you invest in it. It's just exciting for us to be a small part of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| guys leading and making a change within the community. I really appreciate that. Before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| we start tonight I want to kind of remind ourselves. I do it every week. I know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| get tired of it, but some of our ground rules. Remember only one person gets angry at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| I think we've done really well. You guys have been so well behaved. I tell you some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| in Texas don't do that well, but you guys have been awesome. I appreciate that. Use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| your lights. Don't interrupt. Probably as important as anything else tonight is realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| that this whole discussion has been able to bring you to the point process wise that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| can do your legislative duty. I don't know how many times an interested party, not you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| but an interested party or a member of the media or something would say to me, so what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| are you going to tell them to do? I would say, I would tell them they need to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| Your legislature is going to make the decision. Your legislative bodies. You guys are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| to make those decisions. Tonight we're going to try to move you to a place that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| go back to your individual bodies, either individually or collectively. The chairs can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| work that out of how you move to your final decisions. Here's the thing I want to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| you of. When we get to these last kind of workshops, what I've noticed is people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| kind of begin to see the end zone. We've worked really hard and now we're starting to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| everything and people are coming up with ideas and they're thinking we could tweak this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| we could rewrite this, we could describe it this way, and they're starting to see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| end of it. To be honest, this thing started years ago. The tendency is to try to sprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| to the finish. We're going to rush to that end and try to get an answer and just get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| it over with because, you know, that old Jerry Clower joke of shoot up amongst us because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| one of us needs relief. We're all this place, we want to finish. Tonight, I want to still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| work good process. We're not going to try to rush to the end and get an answer or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| That's really the work of the legislative groups. We want to continue to work our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| and have a good conversation and talk about some of our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| I want to review quickly kind of where we've been. You know, this is our last scheduled workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| We've had some really productive meetings. In that first meeting, I know some of you thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| what is he doing when I wanted to ask about motivation and interest, but we had that first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| conversation about where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do and what was driving the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| You remember that second meeting we came back and we really just kind of talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| how does this plan even work? There was some belief perhaps that appointed bodies had too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=365)|
| 0:06:13| much power, the legislative bodies really wouldn't have say, so we kind of talked through that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| came to the conclusion that even within this particular plan, that everybody has right to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| appeal back to legislative bodies, that we want to build flexibility into that. That was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| I think, an important moment. And then finally, the last time we got together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| we had the big conversation, the slope, clearing, and density. I mean, that's what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| when you ask anybody what the problems were, that's what everybody talked about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| And we got to deal with this slope, clearing, and density. And really kind of on slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| I think it was that we really thought that under 40 percent it didn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| That there's not that much change, if at all, and above 40 percent there was change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| And in that discussion, though, when we got to clearing, there were some differences, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| And particularly, I think Councilman Della Volpe, you know, pointed out that at 25 to 40 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| he was a little concerned about that 15 percent limitation. Is that fair? That clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| you know, probably may be a different animal on top of that, and maybe even the idea of no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| development at above 50 percent. And so we kind of talked through that a little bit and left that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| discussion. We may come back to that a little bit later tonight. And finally, we discussed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| density issues. Tonight, I want to continue that discussion. And I want you to see this, the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=450)|
| 0:07:38| topics tonight that are brought up aren't as intensely researched, don't seem to have as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=458)|
| 0:07:47| of the comparative data as the others, but they're all four topics that have been brought to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| attention by different members of the Commission and Council, so I wanted to make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| address them tonight. All right? And so I'm going to bring those up and kind of talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| Let's drop my note here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| And be able to address them as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=490)|
| 0:08:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=502)|
| 0:08:42| I'm getting old and disorganized, Larry. I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| The first issue tonight that was brought up and questioned was the concept of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| development. And basically, what was asked, the question was asked, and I'd like us to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| for a few minutes, and we're going to kind of do this force field discussion as we did before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| where we talk about what we hear are strengths and weaknesses and do some comparative look here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| The question was asked to me, is the commercial development end too limiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=546)|
| 0:09:15| What it seems to me that I can tell from the conversations I've had with MPC and with others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| is first of all, we need to remember that all pre-existing and commercially zoned properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| in the hillside and ridgetop protection area are not affected by this plan. You know, someone asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| me recently, you know, if it's already zoned, does this change? And apparently no. And so we now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| move into this discussion of those, but what happens when there is new zoning? What happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| when you want to build in those areas? The current plan says that non-residential use on slopes over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| 15 percent can be built via planned development zone. That's in your general plan. You can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| that page 65. You see that. The proposed plan pretty much says the same thing, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=594)|
| 0:10:03| You guys helped me with this, but it says planned commercial zoning districts need to be recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| and they follow a zoning plan. Now those who've been involved, and you've been studying this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| looking at this, does that seem to be, Commissioner Norman, you were involved in the writing of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| does that seem to be an accurate portrayal of those two? Right. We saw the need for, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| obviously places where there's major roads or highways that are going through ridge lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| and when those intersect, there's opportunities for commercial development that are already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| and we saw those as, that's a reasonable use to continue, expand that, you know, have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| opportunity for developers to expand those as they need to, or as, you know, it seems to fit with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| economy of the area. So we made adjustments in the plan for that. Great. I'm going to ask Mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| Donaldson, I know you get to crawl over people to do this, but it's a basic, the question I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| ask is a basic one, and you got to give Mark credit because I catch him cold. I don't prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| him for any questions, just whatever crosses my mind he gets stuck with. How does that type, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| that first question of non-residential now following a planned development zone, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| idea now that the planning zone district should be recommended, how does that different? Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| a difference in the current way we do it and the proposed way you manage it? I would say there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| no difference, and the thing to keep in mind is that within the proposed hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| protection area, there is currently a very, very, very small percent of the land that is zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| commercial, non-residential, and there is an even smaller amount of land that carries a non-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| residential land use classification. So there's literally more zoning in the hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| protection area than there is planned land use, and the plan allows for the creation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=723)|
| 0:12:15| non-residential special districts that meet the recommended criteria that are in the plan. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=735)|
| 0:12:24| the plan actually is broader than the current policy. So you're understanding what I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| that there's actually a broader scope in your idea of the plan. With that last provision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| the planning commission added to the task force version. And all of you have this commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| this list here, this is what he's talking about, these comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| The other thing I wanted to bring up was that right now in the current plan, I think the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| county sector plan was adopted by council commission that recommends commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| should be prohibited on hillsides greater than 15 percent. Can you kind of expand on that a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| bit for information's sake? Yeah, the east county sector plan is the most recently adopted sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| plan update, and it embedded many of the policies that are proposed in the hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=788)|
| 0:13:16| protection plan, including the proposed geography. And the recommendation was not to amend the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| use plan to provide for commercial or non-residential land uses above that 15 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| threshold. And that's currently in place? That was adopted a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| In the proposed plans, there is the proposal that commercial building should not be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| on slopes greater than 15 percent. However, you see, and correct me if I'm wrong, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| and anyone else who understands this better than I do, but there are a couple of exceptions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| proposals attached to that across the bottom. Commercial uses may extend up to the 25 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| slope mark with the provision of tree restoration planning on the cut slope below that. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| accurate? That's correct. And also then a special district provision, and you can help me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| expand on this for a second, because I didn't quite understand all this. There's a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| district provision that allows for building commercial and office space on steeper slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| and ridgetops. And here's where I would like kind of some definition. When it's advantageous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| for employment-centered development with good transportation systems. Does that mean it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| logical place that's got good roads? You got it. Okay. Well, you know, big words get me, so I kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| of have to push those down. All right. And so that is kind of what I think kind of the key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=877)|
| 0:14:45| the key kind of phrases within that commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| topic. Is that accurate as far as you can understand? Yes, sir. Anybody else want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| kind of clarify that if there's anything else within that commercial that you want me to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| or Mark can clarify? Any questions? Yeah. On the bottom statement, special district provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=899)|
| 0:15:09| who makes that provision to the legislative body or MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| That would be an amendment to the land use plan that's contained within each sector plan. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| the way the current process is that MPC considers it, adopts it, and then it's ratified by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| legislative body. So, without the elective bodies, it doesn't become? It's not operative until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| legislative body approves it. Okay. And Councilman De La Volpe. Yeah. Maybe Mark can clarify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| but I'm assuming the reason for the difference in commercial is that it generally requires a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| whole lot more clearing and a whole lot of hard surfaces that have runoff. And if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| put that on the hillside, we're going to make big problems. I'm assuming that's one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| we have the limit for commercial that it tends to sprawl out and take up a lot of land base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| Well, that's certainly a factor, but it's also non-residential opportunities are closely tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| to the transportation system and the transportation system runs on the flat land, generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| unless it's cutting through a gap. Are you including more than public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| you're talking about? Roads. Just roads themselves. You've got to move a lot of cars in and out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| commercial. Yeah, there's a distinct correlation between the land use plan and the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| plan. All right. And so I hear two things. I think Councilman De La Volpe makes a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| You know, you're concerned about hard surface runoff and that attached, but probably as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| as anything else, you're tying it to good transportation. It doesn't make much sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| to do building off, you know, off a dirt road somewhere. And so you're trying to tie those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| together. All right. Anything else kind of jumping out you want to kind of clarify with that? So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| basically, at this point, you know, that they try not to build over 15%. You should have a land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| development, you know, zone attached. And if you do that, the east county sector wouldn't even let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| them do that, but that's there and current and it's allowed with zone development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| The new plan, then, if my understanding is right, you can extend to 25% with special provision and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| there's even a special district provision for even steeper slopes or ridge tops as long as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| meets certain standards. Andy said that's through MPC that has to be ratified then by the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| legislative body. That's my understanding of commercial kinds of issues. Anything else you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| want to add to that for the body's sake? We good? Everybody understand that? Feel pretty good about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| where we're at? So, basically, what we're talking about at this point is that this would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1062)|
| 0:17:51| so far, the only exception to the fact that nothing under 40 has been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| That would, would that be safe to say? Well, the previous discussion was talking primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| about residential, the residential density factors that we would make as recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| and that's. This will be the only exception. We're basically, does residential need to be put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| into that some way? Well, residential is already allowed. I know, but. Into the hillside. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| talking about a new document here. Are you talking about under special provision? Is that what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| referring to, Mike? Well, it wouldn't necessarily have to be. Well, it is going to be because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1109)|
| 0:18:38| all going to be planned, which constitutes further plan review. But, when we look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1118)|
| 0:18:48| you know, one of the big issues that was facing this plan, you know, from those against it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| the fact that it, that it changed everything from 15% up when, in effect, it does not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1136)|
| 0:19:05| except for this one exception now that we've got to. Yeah, and that exception broadens the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| flexibility as far as doing commercial activity above 15%. This defines it where we never had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| this discussion before publicly so that this information could be disseminated out. Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1159)|
| 0:19:27| Okay, excellent. That's a good point. Yes, Commissioner Holmby. Yeah, sorry. I just want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1167)|
| 0:19:36| I guess, point something out. I guess on the, where it says proposed, it says commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| buildings should not be built. I like that wording because it doesn't mean it can't be built. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| think I want to be clear. I think that's an accurate phrase. It should not be built. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| not a, it's, I want to make sure that I phrased that right. Is that the correct wording or should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| it be stronger wording from the NPC's point of view? The intent in the plan is to use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| should. We scrubbed it, what we thought thoroughly. We actually found a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| musts in there. And there's one must that we would love to change. But other than that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| everything else says. That's been the sticking point on this. Some of these has been the must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| instead of the should. Everything else is. But if you put must in here, it negates this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| other thing. Absolutely. That's why I wanted to clarify that. That's why I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| That's why I'm asking. This is a should as far as the clarity is concerned with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| Okay. Excellent. Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Well, great. Let's move on to the ridgetop definition. I've been asked this one multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| times, you know. What's the definition of a ridgetop? And my understanding is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1251)|
| 0:21:01| there is no written definition of a ridgetop. But in the proposed plan, it's basically the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| flatter area above a ridge's steeper slopes. We'll define that. There's the flat area above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| a steep slope is a ridgetop. That seems to be the two. Now, the second question I've been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| I think we need to sort through with that, is why haven't you used like rise and elevation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Or why haven't you used just elevation for ridgetops? I've heard people say. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| kind of told what I've heard, right? That this is just pretty broad. Why do you just like pick an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| elevation and anything above that elevation is a ridgetop or a certain rise and that's a ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| Which, you know, seems like a logical question. I'm going to pick on Mark again because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| I asked him that question. They gave me an answer. But rather than repeat what you said to me, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| just going to the source. Well, the task force spent a great amount of time talking about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1308)|
| 0:21:58| ridges look like, how you would go about defining them. And the truth is that there is no single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| type of ridge in Knox County. There are rolling ridges and knife-shaped ridges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| tabletop ridges. And to try to define it would be extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| Certainly within the proposed hillside and ridgetop protection area, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| captured the tops of slopes. And we call them ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| And the task force started from the point of view of trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| describe those ridges that were worthy of protection and moved beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| Started at a point looking at elevations and because of the particular topography of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| County, discovered that that was a very difficult and probably nonproductive way to attack the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| problem. And as an example, there's a ridge in the northeastern part of the county that at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1375)|
| 0:23:04| base of the ridge, the base of that ridge is lower than Fort Loudon Lake. So if we use that elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| to be the starting point of ridges, we would have essentially all of Knox County covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| And then you would then move into the exercise of going ridge by ridge and determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| at what point that is the toe of the slope. And that is the process through which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1405)|
| 0:23:35| reached consensus on the task force to adopt the methodology used by the University of Arkansas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1415)|
| 0:23:43| and produce the proposed hillside and ridgetop protection area, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| captures slope and those parcels that drain through that sloped area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| I've got a question because I kind of looked that up on the University of Arkansas and they had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| stuff about ridgetop also. And this is just for me, if you can help me with this. They said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| and it could be Mike, I don't know, that certain types of ridgetops might be in watershed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| others aren't. Certain things at higher elevation might be better for building things at lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| elevation. Is that, and I'm just trying to clarify. I mean, I don't quite get all that. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| if Mike wants to hop into that or what you want to do, but that would help me with clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| a little bit. Well, in describing the proposed protection area, we certainly took all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| into consideration. And in recommending those density and clearing factors, we use factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1476)|
| 0:24:47| for those less steep areas of the protection area comparable to what we would use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| anywhere in the county that has that same sort of land use plan designation. So we are, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| reflecting that on the flat spots within the protection area, whether they be at the top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| a ridge or in a hanging valley or on a bench that's been established, you get to do what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| everybody else outside of the area is doing within that area, within that slope group. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1512)|
| 0:25:23| the methodology acknowledges that and provides the flexibility to be used throughout the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1523)|
| 0:25:33| instead of analyzing each and every individual ridge as it comes up for discussion. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1533)|
| 0:25:43| and so that's how I hear that described. I would love to hear some comments back. I'll start on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| this side, the left side of the room, and anybody else that wants to hop in, just use your light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| we can go from there. Yeah, I was trying to understand what Mark said at the end. I gather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| if a ridge has a big flat spot on it, then the slope or lack of serious slope up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| allows you to develop that piece as long as you can do it consonant with the other criteria. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| is that fair? Correct. All right. One comment I've heard is that this whole process started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| you know, partly from the visual assault on the ridges, and then, of course, people point to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| water tower up by the Cherokee condos as maybe a trigger point for starting it. But the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| is raised, is every ridge to be treated the same, or are there some ridges that are scenic either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1587)|
| 0:26:36| because they're higher, because they're more visible from roadways or places where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| live? In other words, are there classes of ridges that have a higher scenic value that should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| some overlay or protection on them, and others that have a lesser concern? Obviously, steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| topography causes questions about runoff, erosion, siltation, all that stuff, but was there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| discussion about that part of it? There was discussion about the visual and scenic aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| of the overlay, but I think that moved aside and was overtaken by concerns about water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1625)|
| 0:27:14| And the steepness dictates the results that we're trying to control. Yeah, this is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| visual protection plan. It's protection of the hillsides and ridgetops, primarily to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| or mitigate the impacts of water moving. And I think that might be an important thing, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| Commissioner Ownby, I'll come back to you, but I want to pursue this one. If anybody else has those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| questions or comments, because I've heard that also, Councilman, you know, well this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| primarily about visual, and yet this doesn't seem to be a visual description. So does anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| have a question? Yes. I just want to comment to that, and being on the task force, we spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| a lot of time talking about the visual aspect, since the whole thing did, you know, it did get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| started with the water tower. What we saw, though, was it was really difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| really analyze values, you know, what somebody values. In terms of judgment. Yeah, yeah, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| very subjective, and so we just shifted to basically say all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1691)|
| 0:28:20| ridge lines are valuable in their own way, and certainly water is the issue that we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| address because of the tremendous damage that's potential if we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| unwise development on ridges. And there are certainly recommendations in the plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| speak to aesthetics. You know, there are recommendations about the choice of colors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| are used on buildings that are on the ridges. There's recommendations about keeping a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| amount of tree cover on the ridge line itself, and there's also recommendations about height, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1732)|
| 0:29:02| to a certain degree is aesthetic, but it also has a lot to do with fire safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| But what I hear you saying is those are discussions about as you develop on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| ridge top, but in terms of definition of ridge top, it was not primarily an aesthetic thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| and what I heard Councilman DeVolpe ask is which is it, and then I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| Commissioner Norman's response is it became just a matter, you know, then you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| whose taste is involved in what's aesthetic and what's not, so you move more to the protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| and water issues. Is that fair? Anybody on that particular topic as far as aesthetic value of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| ridge tops, anybody else want to add to that? Or is this in relation to that also? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| Anybody else want to add to that before I go on to Commissioner Ownby's comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| Great. Commissioner Ownby, you wanted to hop in and comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Yeah, comment on this, and also I want to make a statement because I've got to leave early, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| the way I'm understanding this is that the ridge tops are going to be basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1797)|
| 0:30:06| are they going to be done a case-by-case since we're not doing an overlay on the whole county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| we're saying, okay, as somebody wants to develop these, they're going to do a case-by-case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| and look at the slope percentages and if it's just a peak or if they can build or not build, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| That's right, and that's, you know, in my mind, that's the beauty of the recommendation of using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| a planned development district to develop residential on the slopes and the ridge tops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| is that you do have the opportunity to look at a plan and to determine on a site-specific basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1834)|
| 0:30:43| those areas which make most sense to be developed, and then we can look to determine where those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| breaks in the topography are that we might want to protect and leave a few more trees and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| sort of thing. Okay, yeah, that was, I mean, I like that, that we're going to do a case-by-case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| because I don't like the whole blanket, every ridge top is going to be treated exactly the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| because they're not all exactly the same, and my statement before I have to leave is, this is just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| I guess, something that's concerned me and I've got a bunch of calls about it too, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| we have four different lawyers that are involved in all this process, the NPC, the chamber, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| then the city and the counties. I'd like to have an opinion on this process from all four to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1884)|
| 0:31:32| what we're dealing with before we can make a decision on where we need to go from here. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| yes, there's going to be changes, we're going to come up with a compromise, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| we need to know the opinions and what we're dealing with so that to protect the citizens too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| from lawsuits or anything else that might come down the pike. And I was going to address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| a little bit later, but I can jump into that. I'm sorry, I just wanted to say before I left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| So let me do this while you're still here, Commissioner, because I think from the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| you had a memo, all of you from the chamber, on their opinion on the legality. We then took that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| to the legal representatives of the bodies, and I don't know if Mr. Swanson wants to address it or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| Daniel was going to do that, but I got something back from Joe Jarrett. So would you like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| address that real quickly? I guess I could. I think generally the lawyers have in fact reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1939)|
| 0:32:28| agreement with regard to our opinions with regard to the legality of what's being done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| That this is something that is being done in an appropriate lawful process, despite the objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| and the opinion of the memo that you received. Every process that we follow is subject to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1961)|
| 0:32:50| type of criticism, typically due process type criticism, and you never know whether the correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| answer to that question is yes, we've done it correctly or no, we haven't done it correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| until you go to court and some judge tells you whether that's right or not. And you're not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| then until you go to the next level and the court of appeals gives you an opinion there. So despite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| the fact that we love certitude and we would like to have certitude, I don't think that certitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| is going to be available to you with regard to the legal issues. What we have is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| agreement between the county lawyers and the city lawyers that an appropriate process has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| followed and that we do not see significant legal issues in what is being proposed, either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| initially proposed or what we have heard about what is being proposed in terms of potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| modifications to it, that would cause us serious concerns about the ability to legally defend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| if challenged. So I think that may be the best we can do for you, although the county law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| Joe Jarrett, when we get into this issue of we want a legal opinion here and we want to dispute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| this illegal opinion here and go back and forth and back and forth, lawyers can do that forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| We're really good at that. And so county law director Jarrett has asked the MPC lawyer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| weigh in on that process as well because that opinion is important as well. But I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| bottom line, which is really what you're looking for, is that we believe that the process followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| and the outcome of that process is a legally defensible product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| And that's all I'm asking. I'm not that naive to think that nothing will go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| I'm not saying that, that we could be excused from anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| But this process, I mean, let's go back a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| We were told that we could vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| There was no changing it until we voted it down and then we can make changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| The city was told different. They were told to up or down or you can change it and send it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| May I interrupt here? And I apologize for this. I don't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| But I really don't think the advice was different. I think it was perhaps viewed differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| But the process is when the Metropolitan Planning Commission, whether it's for the county or whether it's for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| proposes to us changes in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| When it comes from them, we have to vote it, you have to vote it, or the city council has to vote it either up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| But that doesn't mean that you're stuck with that product either up or down forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| What that means is if you want a different product than what came from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| you may initiate your own plan that incorporates 98% of that if you want to and just change it 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| Or you can change it 98% and just incorporate 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| You can do that, but you've got to go through the process once more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| It doesn't mean that it can't be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| It just means the process that you follow in making it different is a little different process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Yeah, and I understand that. I'm just saying that the city, because I was at the meeting, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| was told that they could make the change right there on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| And that's not what we were told. But that's irrelevant at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| We haven't gotten an opinion from the MPC attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Because he didn't get the memo until apparently last week or this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| And I'm just asking that we get that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Mr. Sanders, could you kind of tell me what your plan is to make sure that happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| We're waiting for Mr. Wise from the MPC to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Steve, if we could get everybody to give their name and affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Daniel Sanders, Deputy Law Director for Main Street Suite 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| There have been some memos going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| We're waiting for everybody that's interested to weigh in before we come down one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| We've said throughout this whole process, just like Mr. Swanson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| we don't see any red flags. We believe you should go forward with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| But you will talk to the MPC. You guys will come up with an opinion back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| They will have heard from each of the counsel for each of the three groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| I would defer to the law director on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| I'm not saying that we shouldn't go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| I don't want anybody to misread what I'm saying or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| I'm just saying that I want to make sure that we have all of our T's crossed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| and all of our I's dotted and that we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I've read over Dela Vope's, Councilman Dela Vope's thing so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| I like what I see with a few minor tweaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| Wonderful. Thank you for your time. I know you have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Anything else you'd like to add on this particular topic on Ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| Short footnote, and that is that I think the most recent change that MPC came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| which was to lump 40% and above, takes in that flexibility comment we had last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| That is that no track has a no development flag on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| It may be that the standards are very high if you're on a very high and steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| But no property owner can say that he's denied the right to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| If he can do it right, if he follows the right procedures, gets the right engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| So I think we actually reduced the risk of litigation by adding the flexibility in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Good. And that's work that Mr. Norman and MPC had worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| Is that accurate, the way he described it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Right. I think that what we tried to do, of course, was it was just another language issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2313)|
| 0:38:42| When you say no development, the intent, you know, when we use this budget aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| it really wasn't no development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| It just meant that if you had a restricted category right there, which that never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| I mean, you just don't have a parcel that gets isolated in that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| I know, but it's the Toro red flag thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Right. For sure, it is a red flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| So I think that table, when we take up, when the councilmen and commissioners can look at that table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| it's certainly the red flag is no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| And we'll talk about that table in the second half of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I appreciate that. One more comment. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Just so I'm going to be sure I heard what I heard when we're talking about these red stocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| because this is one of the hot buttons from those against from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| They are going to be taken on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| We're not throwing a big blanket over 65 or 72.5% of the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Could you just do a yes or no confirmation of that from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| No, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| I'm trying. I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Okay. Yes. You got a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| I'd say this is just one of the four or five really hot subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| And I think that's the one that we need to get out on the table and get aired so that everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| But we did not have a chance to do that at our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| As we've said several times before, as Commissioner Olmey said a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| there was really no discussion. It was up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Well, I'm glad we're having it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| That's great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Next topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| We're ready to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| The other two would be, I'm going to go to protection area size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| I've had it expressed to me and I've heard from some of you that just the protection area is so large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2431)|
| 0:40:39| Now, I'm going to ask this question again just of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| It seems to me from my limited understanding that that protection area is determined by slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| Is that how you got the size of the protection area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| Slope is a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| And then after areas of a certain size, contiguous areas of a certain size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| and a certain total change in elevation are grouped together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| then the model looks at other areas that are above those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| so that water would drain through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| That is how we literally capture the ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| So, yes, it is all a function of looking at slopes with our GIS capability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2484)|
| 0:41:32| looking at contiguity of slope groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| and looking at some filters as far as total rise in order to throw out the little ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2496)|
| 0:41:45| And the question I want to ask the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| does the flexibility tied now into slope and into ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| mitigate for you guys any of the concern for the size or is it still a concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| Is that question clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| In other words, if there's flexibility within that, does it matter as much or does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| Ninety-eight percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Ninety-eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| You got two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| I got 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| I think actually for Commissioner Brown, 98 is pretty good, you know, but I'm just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Well, you used 98 earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| I just thought I told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Ninety-eight would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| One other thought, and it may just be as the phrase Tony used, language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| There may be places in the plan where we need to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| that this is a should or recommended approach that not necessarily applies to every parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| but so that when we get down to the tough decision-making on specific ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| our hands are not tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| And so it may be that it's a phrase or a preface or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| that gives that leeway to legislate different than the umbrella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| but that was always the fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| The umbrella tied your hands to how you might get down to specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| And obviously, as a compilation of good practice and good things to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| this is a great document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| But if it's rigid, we start to steer towards maybe an undesirable result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| And I'm going back to your concept of how much land is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| In other words, in general, it's good, but specifics matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| Land is all different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| Any comments to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| I think when the members have time to read the proposal that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| that MPC and I worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| I think overall what you'll see is the intent is to soften the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| and emphasize the flexibility that's inherent in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| And that's both from the calculations and the tables that are adjusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| and from where we're trying to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| or we're adding a couple of sections that clarify and stress those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2637)|
| 0:44:06| It's not a document that is intended to be ordinance-directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| or to be like an ordinance would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| It's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| It's guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| And there are places where we didn't stress that enough, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| Didn't have quite enough language there to stress that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| And I want to ask Mark one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Mark, I know you've already spoken 12 times, but would you identify yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| Mark Donaldson of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| What percentage of this is zoned agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| Do you have any idea what that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Because that's a different animal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Yeah, let's just review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| And this is in big, broad numbers and probably grossly rounded off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| But roughly 131,000 acres are captured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| within the proposed hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| Of that, more than 60% is within the rural classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| which essentially says that all development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| will be either agriculture or rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| except for some very specific exceptions for rural commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| and industrial and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| So most of the area is within our rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| Most of Knox County, 70% of Knox County, is still zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| So most of the proposed geography is still zoned agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| which simply has a one-acre minimum lot size for any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2749)|
| 0:45:58| Then stepping back, if you look at the area as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| roughly two-thirds of it is already developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| as low-density residential, either in subdivisions or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| Two-thirds of the remaining 40%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| Two-thirds of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| The whole thing, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Either in platted subdivisions or parcels less than two acres, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| Parcels less than two acres that have a house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| So that's kind of our definition of rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| So we're really not talking about a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| Well, we've taken a whole lot of that 131,000 acres off of the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| because it's planned for extremely low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| or already developed as low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| or extremely low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| That's just as much for me as anybody else understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| this is not all new development that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Commissioner Norman, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| Your light was still on, so I was just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| I didn't want to ignore anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Any questions then now on the size protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| I'll make sure we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Finally, the cost implementation, which I've heard on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| And this is where I'm going to need some help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| From what I see, there is not any real straightforward process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| for identifying the generalized identification of cost development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| In other words, I guess my question I may ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| I don't know who I would ask in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| but how do you go about deciding the fiscal cost of implementation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Is there a process you guys use if you're going to do something different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| Is there somebody who kind of works almost like the GAO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| who looks at what potential costs are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Do you guys have a designated person for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| We would have our finance director that we would ask to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| He would, I'm sure, have his staff look at it on the county side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| and work with Mr. Donaldson and MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| and try to come back to us with an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| And we haven't done that at that point, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| And so I think you could look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| There were some, yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| It's important to distinguish when we're talking about the cost of implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| the cost of implementing the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| versus the cost of implementing the proposed regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| that are identified in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| And there is a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| To implement the plan will trigger two activities that we already do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| One, we'd look at rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| and we recommend planned development districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| We're already doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| And if a planned development district is the zoning that's completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| we then review the development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| We're already doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| If you look at residential development in Knox County as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| the planned development districts are the district of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| because it's the district that gives the builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| the ability to hit the markets that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| Nobody chooses to zone RA in the hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| and nobody chooses to zone R1 in the city on the hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| They choose planned residential development already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| So to implement the plan, which is that new geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| and the recommendations associated with that geography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| there is little or no incremental cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| We're already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| Now, as we get into ordinances that codify regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| that's a different ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| And that's the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| That's creating regulation, not creating a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| I appreciate you delineating those two out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| Because what I hear you say, and I want to clarify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| at this point, the implementation of a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| is no more or incrementally more expensive than what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| As you move into step two, there would need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| perhaps from the finance director or whomever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| a look at what it costs as you begin to codify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| or deal with the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| And then as we develop ordinances to implement regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| we would deal directly with the respective engineering departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| of the city and county in creating those ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| Great. Good. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Councilman, I mean, I'm sorry, y'all moved around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| As far as these two legislative bodies are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| I don't think we could separate those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| Because when you go down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| you know, we can vote it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| but as Councilman Della Volpe pointed out in his article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| there may be some additional training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| I mean, we don't know at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| what the training statuses are of all of Mark's staff in MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| or county engineering or water control or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| But I like what he's got in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| that somebody with the smarts is following up on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| So there's where your extra cost is going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| And there's no way probably without doing an inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| of what resources they have now of these qualified people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| to be able to predict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| But I think it's definitely got to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| Anyone want to add to that? Is this a new light here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| Yeah, I was just going to say similar to what Mr. Brown said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| and that is the cost in government typically are salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| and the support services they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| And planning and designing work on steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| without following up with inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| and the training before that is kind of futile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| You've got to make sure it gets done the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| And so those will be bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| and they will have costs and overheads that come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| And like someone else said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| that's what the finance guys are good at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| And, of course, you have a temporal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Right now, nobody's building nothing kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| and so the cost would be kind of low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| But in a peak period, you might have to add, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| trained inspectors to be out there weekly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| you know, checking on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| All right. Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Those are good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| One of the things to consider is that the bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| both the City of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| they have to consider their permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| for water quality, the federal regs, NPDES.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| What we've tried to do on the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| is somewhat separate our goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| what we're trying to achieve from some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| that the stormwater people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| that's really their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| I'd like to remind, in terms of cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| the failure to protect forested hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| are going to result in some tremendous costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| in terms of, potentially, from infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| from lack of compliance with federal regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| So to get into that is a, it's quite an exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| And it's a good subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| but I'd just like to remind the bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| that the stormwater departments, that's really their domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| And for that to deter us from going ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| because we can't get exact numbers about staff salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| or things like that, that may come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| those are things for our engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| those are really engineering questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| And so what I hear, and I didn't hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| and that's a great point, here's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| I hear, well, I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Just a quick follow-up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| Some of these costs are going to be recouped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| because in any other thing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| if you go buy a new car and you want mag wheels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| and you want dual mufflers and tinted windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| you're going to pay for them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| If a certain person is going to build on this ridge stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| they're going to have to understand you can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| but you're going to have to play by the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| that protect everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| I mean, I see that as a comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| You say that they're building that ridge stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| They may have certain costs for building on that ridge stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| to help recoup the cost of enforcement and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| And so what I hear, in summary, I want to clarify this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| because it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I hear Commissioner Brown saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| it is important to know what the costs are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| not against those costs because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| we can recoup some of those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| I hear Councilman De La Volpe going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| there are going to be costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| I mean, there's people costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| I hear Councilman Brown due to demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| Tony's point is that some of the federal water quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| requirements are going to come either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| with or without a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| They're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| They are part of what people have to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| There are civil penalties and criminal penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| for screwing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| And so then I hear Commissioner Norman saying, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| and exactly that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| which is the stormwater people are going to be out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| and we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| So I think it's fair to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| the implementation of the plan, from what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| the implementation, not expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| It's not going to be expensive on the actual this side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| but when you get into the actual enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| there may be costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| You may need to lean towards your finance directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| You understand there's stormwater people involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| and there can be recoupment of costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| but we're not going to deny that if you don't put enforcement in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| then you really don't have a plan that's worth much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| And so you kind of got those both sides of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| Does that sound about right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| and a fair assessment of what we talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Look at the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| I mean, I think the last two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| we've talked about it to a great degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| This is, oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| In regard to costs, which we all want to be efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| and keep down, certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| I don't think we need to lose sight of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| that there's going to be a cost of not doing this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| It may not be directly that the city pays for it directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| but indirectly through private individuals, insurance companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| even the city is going to have to pony up some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| for damages that result if we don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| So we all want to keep a good balance there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| and I'm thinking we can spend a little bit of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| on the protection part that's going to save us costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| if we don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| So here we are, and I would say in the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| since we started July 18th, particularly the last two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| I think, to a great degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| you have talked through the issues that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| We've talked about slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| We've talked about clearing and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| We've talked about protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| implementation of cost, ridgetops, commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| All those are the questions we've been dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| and is there any other comments about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| before we move to just kind of the final phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| of introducing some of the kind of creative ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| that have popped up in the last few days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Your light's still on for a reason there, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| I understand that, but I also didn't want to ignore you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| and make you feel bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| This is my last night here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Don't make anybody mad at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| I'm infuriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| Well, what I think we'll do in just the last few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| is there's been some creative work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Here where we are, we're at the point now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| that we're about to hand this back to the legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| and you do that work way better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| I mean, you've now got this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| and I'll tell you, this plan has been talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| from what I can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| and we've worked through the key concepts of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| We've had people talk about, you know, is this a good plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| Is this a bad plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Should we amend this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| And we're now coming to the point that you can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| Ever how your chairs tend to want to manage that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| whether in groups or within subdivisions or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| you can go back to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| I think you guys are at a place now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| where you can now make some good decisions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| What's really exciting to me is in the last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| and this is when I know that we're moving to some good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| within bodies is when people start themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| taking responsibility to be creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| and think of ways that we can make the plan more workable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| and amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| So I'd like to take a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| hearing from a couple of different groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| one on the commission side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| and then one plan that has been disseminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| on the council side that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| how can we take this and make this workable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| I'd like to give the floor just for a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| to Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Would you kind of talk about you went to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| and you guys started trying to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| to make this plan more usable and a more flexible approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| If you kind of describe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| I think everybody's got a copy of his work here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| and I'd like you to take the floor and deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Well, you can, if you guys want to flip through with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| ours has the title Purpose of Proposed Revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| there at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| Rather than go all the way through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| and you can do this and analyze it yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| but certainly one of the problems we did recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| as we said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| there was some language like no development in one table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| and we saw that we could really accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| what we wanted to anyway probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| by combining some categories in that first table there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| that's on the second, I'm sorry, it's on the third page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| and it's page 33 in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| And so there was discussion in that table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| like Councilman DellaVolpe was talking about the 20 to 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| I mean 25 to 40 percent slope group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| and some difficulties that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| We ran the numbers on some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| trying to develop some parcels in that category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| and saw that, well, we might be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| 15 percent clearing standards in that category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| that might make it kind of tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| And so the staffers that did the math on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| and as we talked we agreed that we don't see 20 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| being an onerous thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| and it would provide with flexibility for the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| to be able to have a little more space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| and a little more consideration in the prospect of grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| That was probably the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Then its effect is in Table 2 in terms of acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| and we just don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| We see that as an example of us offering something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| a little more flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| and then combined with the other language issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| where we're trying to soften, take out the must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| We just think that these are simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| relatively easily done changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| that are pretty easy to understand and see their effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| and so certainly we hope you all will consider those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| as possible changes to the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| And so in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| kind of reading through this, Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| there's kind of three changes here that jump out at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| and clarify others too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| One is on Ridge Top in the 50 percent proposed no development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| that you've allowed room for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| even at the 50 percent slope level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Is that correct also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| So it goes into that budget operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| for calculating whether you can develop or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| So just to remove that language that sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| no development can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| So talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Talk about expanding to 20 percent the proposed clearing level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| and taking out the word used, onerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| that kind of language, the musts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| and things where it sounds like people are being locked down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| and leave more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Would that be the gist of what you guys are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| that I accurately described that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| I'd love any kind of comment for that, response to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Commissioner Brown, did you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Well, kind of, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| You asked where we want to go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| And I walked right by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| I said that and I ignored you, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| That's what I'd like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| I mean, I'd hate to think that we've spent all these hours up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| I know they put three years into it beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| but with these two bodies together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| I certainly have gotten a lot clearer understanding of what's going on now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| than what we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| This is your last night here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| I don't know what our leaders have planned for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| but one question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| are we still going to try to have city, county mirror each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| which I think, if at all possible, it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| Number two, is it possible that MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| or somebody puts these changes into the document in some form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| that this body can get back together, you know, both bodies together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| and look at again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| And we're just about going to have to go through it, you know, page by page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| Well, not necessarily page by page, but category by category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| to be sure that we're all in agreement on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| before it's going to pass through the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| So when is that going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| How are we going to accomplish that fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| And that will be our last point of discussion I'll take back to your chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| after we hear from Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| That's great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| We're catching those kind of on our parking lot up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| because we make sure we want to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Thank you for bringing up some good points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| and I don't want to ignore those coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| Any other questions particularly about Mr. Norman's suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| for kind of more flexibility built into the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| Understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Feel good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| All right, and then on the other side, Mr. DellaVolpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| it kind of came from a different direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| and it's a little more extensive document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| I don't know if you want to read through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| describe it, your approach and what you were thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| and what you hope to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Well, I guess I was trying to focus on how much we can bite off and chew at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| And when you look at the tables at the outset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| and you see that in a sense we are regulating 65% to 72% of the landmass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| I realize a lot of these requirements are already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| or are required by federal and state water pollution control laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| so let's not be confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| But this document purports to be the umbrella for all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| and I wondered whether we had the oomph and the stamina to get that far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| and I certainly didn't want us to ignore that let's take the biggest risk factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| the steepest land, and make sure we address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| I'm not to exclude the other, but the idea was let's look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| and of course we talked about flexibility, and some of that is creeping in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| That was the other aspect because, as we spoke about last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| development is both good and bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| The good part is that it creates jobs and homes and economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| and taxes that run the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| and we certainly don't want to discourage healthy growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| but we do want to control harmful development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| And so that's kind of the yin and the yang of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| And so on the flexibility side, I was talking about if we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| and maybe this is peeking ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| The last two pages of this document really are sort of specific criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| What do you have to do as a developer and a designer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| to get something that's going to pass muster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| Because before you plop down your, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| $1 million or $2 million to buy the land and get going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| and spend a lot of money on engineers and architects and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| you're going to know whether this is a go or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| And without specifics, and in a world where the only answer is a discretionary yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| or no from MPC after you're halfway down the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| you can't make that kind of business judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| So I was saying let's be sure we focus on that aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| and that's what the last half of the document does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| What are things that are important to consider if you're designing for a steep slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| And I brought out in there that the state general construction permit issued May of 2011 uses 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4054)|
| 1:07:43| I backed it off to 30%, but the number could be picked by someone smarter than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| The idea was if we took the steepest land, what requirements do we have to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| And I had that little table on the first page that basically showed that as you got steeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| you had more requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| One of them was qualified inspections and qualified designers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| We've got to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| Writing plans and writing laws that don't self-enforce is kind of futile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| It's a nice act, but it doesn't get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| So I wanted us to be looking ahead at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| And in addition, I think that it comes down to money sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| It has been said here by some folks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| that basically an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| That's the old saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| And if we get folks to do it right, we won't have to spend a lot more money correcting flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| siltation in our streams, problems downstream that we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| And so this idea of shouldn't we be looking at bonding of the essential erosion control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4118)|
| 1:08:46| the sediment control features on a development site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| I mean, you can scratch them into the earth and throw a little grass seed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| but sometimes the grass don't take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| Sometimes the water overwhelms what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| And keeping those structures safe protects homes from flooding, protects streams from siltation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| And I used an example there of how the city had just spent $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| just trying to buy a little flood expansion room up along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| But the one thing that we haven't talked about was when this process first started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| and before I think you were brought on board even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| the question was no one's really an expert on this panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| but it would be nice to hear from somebody with real hydrology kind of chops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| to tell us what's important and what's not from their perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| and also maybe a design engineer who works in subdivision work to see what the practical problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4176)|
| 1:09:44| And we've had information slanted and oriented somewhat from the planning side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| which is good and healthy, but we ought to hear the other side too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| And so I thought as part of the legislative process we ought to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| I don't know if anyone has the stomach for another meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| but I'd love to see us have someone like Dr. Shantz come in and give us a dog and pony, answer some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| and one or two of the developer kind of engineers that say this doesn't work because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| And we get to hear, if not firsthand, then secondhand what has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| I think our job as legislators is to facilitate healthy development and to avoid destructive development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4217)|
| 1:10:25| And I think we're all working towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| And I was trying to boil my thoughts down to about three or four pages, I guess, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| of information that seemed to stand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| And one of the recommendations in there was to consider possibly having a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| and technical advisory panel that exists for the next year and looks at what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| and sees whether this plan is working and whether the ordinances we're adopting need tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| In other words, this is a big enough issue that we should have some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| And I don't know what the best way to do that was, but that was a suggestion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| So that's the thrust of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Obviously you can read the point by points about trying to minimize tree clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| trying to reduce visibility of the structures on hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| They're laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Some of those come from Sevierville and Gatlinburg that actually has steeper land than we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| and so has more of that kind of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| They've actually gone out of their way to codify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| Some of it is information I picked up from talking to people and reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| But, again, it was an attempt to put some concrete ideas out there rather than talking generically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4285)|
| 1:11:33| I think that's enough said about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| I know that you kind of had to gloss over a large amount of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| Do you want to respond to some of that, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| I did a quick read of Nick's, Councilman Del Lope's, proposal today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4305)|
| 1:11:55| And what struck me was most of all is that he really talks about very significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| very important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| There's not anything in there that I would consider or I think the task force would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| isn't important and critical in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| But the problem in the process is that a lot of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| and a lot of it has been a lot of what the Councilman is talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| and these topics, if we were to take them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| and start to go into a process of evaluating those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| I think it would take us back maybe about a year and a half or two years into what the task force did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| I think some of them, especially the more water-specific parts of his proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4360)|
| 1:12:49| these are things that the stormwater departments are going to take up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| Our review, our stormwater ordinance review committee, which has city membership on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| these are all issues that they are dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| How to address bonding and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| A new advisory board is going to be recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| The county commission just accepted some recommendations for a new advisory board on stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| So, you know, ideally, and I'm kind of scooting over towards Commissioner Brown's question too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4399)|
| 1:13:28| I think ideally for me and for some of the staffers that we've talked about, there's a simplicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4408)|
| 1:13:38| I like our proposals for the fact that they're pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| They're easy to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| I think they get us to the concerns that we've expressed in this facilitated session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4425)|
| 1:13:54| It will allow us to be, from the commission standpoint, if we adopt them, you know, somewhat like they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4434)|
| 1:14:03| then it becomes our, you know, it's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| We've just made our new plan, and we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| The plan can become operative, you know, when it goes back to MPC for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| So, we hope that, I think that's kind of, there's not one thing that Nick's talking about that's not really, really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4456)|
| 1:14:28| but to go back in and maybe have sessions with hydrologists and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| these are issues that we've thoroughly discussed and have been in consideration in the development of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4475)|
| 1:14:44| Certainly, there's times when we get to the ordinance phase, there'll be times to vet those individual considerations out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4484)|
| 1:14:54| And so, there's not one thing in there that's not going to be addressed, I think, eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4494)|
| 1:15:02| at least in the process as we get through the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| And so, here we sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| So, we've worked through this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| We've addressed those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| We've come back with, on one side, saying, you know what, we need to make this document more flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| We need to make this thing where people aren't pushed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| They don't feel like their land is being controlled for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| They need to have a way to have flexibility where they can go back to their legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4528)|
| 1:15:40| We want to work that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| And then Nick comes in with, yeah, and at another level, there's some real specific things that we want to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| And I hear both sides agreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| The question is, you know, and just that you get to decide is do you want to go back and redo that within this particular document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4549)|
| 1:15:55| Does that become more of the ordinance process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Are those discussions kind of brought in as we move later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| But those are both very legitimate spots to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Well, and I wasn't suggesting that all of this be put into the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| I think the vision I was trying to express is that we have to have an overviewing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4568)|
| 1:16:16| an umbrella plan that's flexible enough to allow good old-fashioned engineering to solve problems differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| than were conceived when the plan writers wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Every piece of land is going to take a little special look, but there's lots of ways to skin a cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| I hate to use euphemisms, but there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| And to shut those doors to make a rigid plan would be a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| And so some of these things are if we adopt a plan that allows us to get specific criteria for developers and stuff to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4599)|
| 1:16:49| I think we do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I'm not saying that you necessarily pour these into this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| but I do think it's important for us not to shut down good development as much as it is important for us to prevent bad development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| I think that's the balance we have to strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| I think everybody agrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Now, the exciting thing is we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| You're done with me at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Some of you are going to be really glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| You may not welcome me back to Knoxville after putting up with me for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| And I want to – Phyllis and I both want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| You have no idea how much of what happens here is actually her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| She just doesn't like to stand up and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| We know she's the brains behind Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| If you've been with us three minutes, you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| So where we stand is I think we've developed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| We've discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| We've brought to point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| The point is, as someone said early on, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| We need good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| We need some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| In fact, I think Commissioner Brown said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| I need to know where it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| And I guess my question for you tonight, did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| But my question still remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| Are we going to go off to each one of our little hidey holes and work on this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| or are we going to still work together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| And what I'm going to do is hand that back because as I talked to Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| and to Vice Mayor Bailey, that becomes a legislative decision, not mine, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4692)|
| 1:18:20| And that's where you guys step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| Well, first of all, thank you again for your hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| and all of the things that you've done in coming back and forth from Middle Tennessee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| I also want to thank Lawrence Tullock with the Cornerstone Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| because he was the one that is, you know, paying the expenses and the fees and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| And so they were very gracious to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| And we owe them a great deal of gratitude for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| I just want to throw out just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| And, again, just throwing them out for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| I think that now that we have a couple of suggestions from Councilman Della Volpe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| and Commissioner Norman, there may be others who have suggestions as well from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| Perhaps we set a deadline for any further comments or suggestions for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| that we get them to our individual offices and distribute it by a September 23rd date, which is a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4743)|
| 1:19:10| That way we can all have the information, any suggestions anyone has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| There's got to be a public vetting of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| There needs to be a public procedure where people can look at the proposals and have comment on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| And so I do think it's vital that the two bodies get back together again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| after we have taken a look at the suggestions that people have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| Maybe County Commission comes with a suggestion, Council has a suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| but we meet together to see what our individual bodies' suggestions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| or we can meet together and try to hammer that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| It scares me that if we do this that you're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| And so I say that because I think you've done a great job in facilitating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| And so it may be that we might want to bring you back another time or two perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| or we have some type of facilitation where we can do this and do it in a judicious manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| So I just throw that out for the bodies to look at, to see any suggestions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| But we definitely don't want to stop now and just kind of let it go on the shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| I think now is the time where we take these suggestions and we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| Mr. Chairman, I think that on behalf of the Council, we'd like to thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| You've done a great job and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| And, of course, Lawrence Tullock and the Cornerstone Foundation of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| for underwriting the cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| But originally the Council wanted to work jointly with the County Commission on a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| that we could move forward together on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| So I think what the Chairman has said is right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| and I like his idea is that we ought to come up with some dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| And what I'd like to do is to poll the Council on their comments and their feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| and how they'd like to proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| And then I guess the Chairman and I can reconvene here in the next couple of weeks or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| and figure out a plan to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| That sounds great to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| So we're perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| We're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| We'll just talk to the Cornerstone Foundation and figure out how we're going to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| and we'll move forward if we can be of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| At this point, we're now moving into the more legislative work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| and I defer to your expertise in that arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| But happy to facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| If you come back together and you guys do that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| and you want to have a facilitator there, happy to find a way to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| Steve, I concur with both Councilman Bailey and Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4890)|
| 1:21:38| I hope that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| I hope you can work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| We'll probably take up a collection or something if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| The others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Moon pies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| We'll be getting a couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| When we started this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| it really started with the notion that we came together to consider a problem that is a common problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4914)|
| 1:22:03| It's not a problem that we can separate between the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| The city is dependent on us doing good, reasonable things with development in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| or we're going to damage our city and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| What brought us together is just the realization that this is good for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| and we're going to agree, and we started this with the notion, we're going to agree to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| We're going to agree on what are the things that we need to fix in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4952)|

| 1:22:41| I think we've gotten pointed at some changes that we can agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4961)|
| 1:22:50| Therefore, it's a new document for us, for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| and I have high hopes for the city, too, that this will be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| and it will be a good starting point for a change that's long overdue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4980)|
| 1:23:09| Well, that's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| So what I hear you saying is that the chairman will get together in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| You guys are going to do whatever process you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=4995)|

| 1:23:23| You'll select a date that you'll come back together with the thoughts of the council and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| and come back together to try to forge that final document within a meeting or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| to have some kind of consistency on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| If you feel like you need a facilitator, would like me or someone else, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| and we will then lean on your two chairs to kind of walk us through dates, times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| and management of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| Does that sound fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5030)|

| 1:24:04| are you speaking in terms of having a meeting with a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| or just where somebody submits to a website or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| We could do either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| You know, I personally think we need to have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5054)|

| 1:24:35| than they are writing them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| And I think it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Sometimes you can hear the passion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5079)|

| 1:24:56| maybe going in the wrong direction, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| we can get the people that really want to have more stricter protection of the slopes speak out for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5099)|

| 1:25:24| once we have developed a plan or a proposal to give them the opportunity to give their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110901-hillside-protection?start=5124)|
