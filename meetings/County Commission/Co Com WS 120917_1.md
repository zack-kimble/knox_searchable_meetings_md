| 2:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10365)|
| 2:52:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10366)|
| 2:52:47| Other Dr. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10367)|
| 2:52:48| You know, I know and I understand exactly what Commissioner Brown is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10368)|
| 2:52:53| It is hard, you know, when you're a county employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| and you've only seen a three percent pay raise in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| But also in the last five years, and our Medicare recipients recognize this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10380)|
| 2:53:05| is that we've actually had some negative COLAs in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10385)|
| 2:53:10| So even maintaining your salary means that you're getting a pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10390)|
| 2:53:16| The other thing that we've had over the last few years, comparing ourselves to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10396)|
| 2:53:21| basically the city had to put $25 million into their pension fund this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10401)|
| 2:53:26| We're complaining about putting 4.2 or whatever in the sheriff's pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10406)|
| 2:53:30| And they had to go into their fund balance $10 million in order to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10410)|
| 2:53:37| And then also, if you look at our county employees, is that they, I think, receive a six percent match, don't they, on their retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10417)|
| 2:53:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10424)|
| 2:53:45| And let me tell you, there's, I don't know of anywhere on the private sector that you get a six percent match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10425)|
| 2:53:50| A lot of these places, it may be one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| If you're really at a generous place, you get a three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10432)|
| 2:53:56| And for the pensions, the sheriff got a 16 percent of their payroll goes into what we have to pay for their pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10436)|
| 2:54:06| So there's just very, very few places that have that kind of, those kind of matches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10446)|
| 2:54:11| When I say six percent, that's where they start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| And over the course of years, I forget, what does it max out, 12 percent or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| What we do is simply, when the UOP was put into place, we said for general county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10458)|
| 2:54:25| after five years of service, if you'll put in eight, we'll match eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10465)|
| 2:54:29| After ten years of service, if you'll put in ten, we'll match ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| After 15 years, if you put in 12, then we'll match 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10473)|
| 2:54:37| I can tell you that I think it's less than 25 percent of employees take advantage of the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10477)|
| 2:54:42| I mean, you talk about a 12 and a 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| What was it maxed out at, 15 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| 12 percent, but over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10487)|
| 2:54:48| Yeah, 12 percent over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| I don't know of anywhere where there's a 12 percent match on people's retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10490)|
| 2:54:57| I mean, I just wish I could hang around that long, but we do have term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| That's just, I mean, that is just, that's, I don't know, I don't think there's anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10501)|
| 2:55:07| even in the most liberal places there's at, that you have a 12 percent match on your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10507)|
| 2:55:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| You're not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10515)|
| 2:55:16| Hang around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10518)|

| 2:55:27| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| Second with one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10529)|
| 2:55:30| I kind of like the sheriff has scanners and tasers on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10530)|
| 2:55:34| That's a heck of a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10534)|
| 2:55:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10539)|
| 2:55:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10540)|

| 2:55:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10551)|
| 2:55:52| These are, this is one of the resolutions that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| It's resolution 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| It is approving a fund balance designation general purpose school fund in the amount of 13,795,000 dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10558)|
| 2:56:07| For an addition and renovations at Pond Gap Elementary School, 7 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10567)|
| 2:56:12| An addition and renovations at Shannondale Elementary School, 4,015,000 dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10572)|
| 2:56:18| Facility enhancements at Farragut High School, 1,750,000 dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10578)|
| 2:56:23| Science laboratory upgrades, 800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10583)|
| 2:56:26| And technology and technology assessment, 230,000 dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10586)|
| 2:56:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10592)|
| 2:56:33| Do we need a motion here or is this a consent item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10597)|
| 2:56:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10598)|
| 2:56:39| I hear a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10601)|
| 2:56:42| And right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10610)|
| 2:56:51| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10611)|
| 2:56:52| Resolution 212, amending the fiscal year 2013 general purpose school fund budget to provide for an increase in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10612)|
| 2:57:01| amount of 1,765,000 dollars to fund a mid-year 2% salary increase for classified employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10621)|
| 2:57:10| $750,000 and to fund a portion of the increase in health insurance premiums in order to hold constant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10630)|
| 2:57:17| the proportionate share paid by employees, 1,015,000 dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10637)|
| 2:57:24| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10647)|
| 2:57:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10651)|
| 2:57:32| Maybe someone from the schools could come down and talk a little bit about this because this doesn't look like a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10652)|
| 2:57:38| to me, like a general consent kind of pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| So this looks like recurring costs and it looks like it's going to go something that we'll have to continue to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10660)|
| 2:57:46| So correct me if I'm wrong and tell me how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10666)|
| 2:57:48| No, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| And, Mr. Chairman, if I may, and you looked at a couple of spreadsheets earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10669)|
| 2:57:54| with your indulgence, if I could pass something out to the commission, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10674)|
| 2:58:11| This is actually a piece of context that may be more useful to the item that you've already adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10691)|
| 2:58:16| but it's historical revenues, both sales tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10696)|
| 2:58:19| and property tax revenues over the last ten years or so that support Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10699)|
| 2:58:24| And my point in providing this to you is to show, first of all, that the trends over time and our efforts to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10704)|
| 2:58:33| those trends and yet to be, as Mr. Caldwell has talked about, to be fairly, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10713)|
| 2:58:40| actually very fiscally conservative in the budgets that we put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10720)|
| 2:58:44| And so, Commissioner McKenzie, when you ask about this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10724)|
| 2:58:48| this is an increase to our general fund budget that's before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10728)|
| 2:58:53| And it's based on actually the third element of our Knox County schools budget revenue, the third major component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10733)|
| 2:59:01| which is basic education program funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| That's the BEP or the major component of funding for public education from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10744)|
| 2:59:11| So I give you this handout to show you that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10751)|
| 2:59:15| I agree with Mr. Caldwell's perspective on being fiscally conservative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10755)|
| 2:59:19| but I also feel comfortable with the designations that the Board of Education have made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10759)|
| 2:59:24| and with this allocation that the school board has made in terms of the two components of a salary increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10764)|
| 2:59:35| for our non-certified employees, which our non-certified folks were kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10775)|
| 2:59:40| are kind of in a position where county employees were as of last year in that they haven't had a raise since January of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10780)|
| 2:59:48| And then also we know on Knox County schools that our health insurance premiums are going to go up considerably January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10788)|
| 2:59:56| And the board has approved this component, applying some of these additional revenues toward making sure that we keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10796)|
| 3:00:02| proportion that are of the premiums that our employees pay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10802)|
| 3:00:07| Let me back up and say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10807)|
| 3:00:10| We have, in going through the budget development process, and I think Mr. Caldwell made reference to it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10810)|
| 3:00:18| we obviously try very carefully to project what the revenues are going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10818)|
| 3:00:23| We look at all manner of forecasts and information that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10823)|
| 3:00:27| One of the things that happened this spring was that I think because the state had additional resources coming into its coffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10827)|
| 3:00:35| we got something that we don't get every year, which is called BEP growth funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| And that's additional funds that recognize that we had some enrollment growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10839)|
| 3:00:43| We don't get that every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| We don't even necessarily get it every year we have enrollment increases, but we do get it when the resources are available from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10845)|
| 3:00:52| That gets built into our BEP funding going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| So this is an additional, the total that we got is an additional $4.9 million in BEP dollars over our initial assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10855)|
| 3:01:06| And so part of that, the board has approved using for health insurance premiums and for a raise for non-certified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10866)|
| 3:01:15| The rest of that, the board, I have recommended to the Board of Education that we put toward replacing some of the one-time funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10875)|
| 3:01:23| that the County Commission approved as part of the additional $7 million that you all appropriated to Knox County Schools this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10883)|
| 3:01:31| If you remember that discussion, Knox County committed $1.5 million of fund balance and Knox County Schools committed $1.5 million of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10891)|
| 3:01:40| And I've recommended to the Board of Education that we use these recurring dollars to replace those one-time dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10900)|
| 3:01:47| So I think it's sensible. I think it's prudent. I think it's fiscally conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10907)|
| 3:01:51| And our finance folks working with the county finance department still feel comfortable that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10911)|
| 3:01:59| with the revenues that we have after the fund balance designations that you all discussed a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10919)|
| 3:02:06| and after working through this particular proposal, we anticipate that we'll have about $7 million in fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10926)|
| 3:02:14| over the 3% required by state law that we have to have, the 3% of our operating budget that we have to have by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10934)|
| 3:02:22| So again, we agree with the perspective of being fiscally conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10942)|
| 3:02:26| We want to be careful and prudent, as Mr. Caldwell said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10946)|
| 3:02:30| And we believe that these expenditures are that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10950)|
| 3:02:35| Okay. Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10957)|
| 3:02:40| To say it one more time in my country voice, it's reoccurring dollars for a reoccurring expense, and it's coming from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10960)|
| 3:02:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10968)|
| 3:02:49| You know, you do that a lot better than I do. That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10969)|
| 3:02:52| I've got to develop a country voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10972)|
| 3:02:55| Okay. We have a motion to approve. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10978)|
| 3:02:59| Opposed? Ayes have it. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| Motion 803 is designating or committing and appropriating funds from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013 for various funds and departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10982)|
| 3:03:14| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10996)|
| 3:03:17| Okay. Mr. Caldwell, would you like to speak, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=10997)|
| 3:03:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11002)|
| 3:03:26| Having conversations with a few departments as we was going through this process of having a surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11006)|
| 3:03:33| and trying to determine what do we really think is necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11013)|
| 3:03:37| and two things came up from two different departments and one on our end in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11017)|
| 3:03:45| And here they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11025)|
| 3:03:46| Basically, in this spreadsheet, which is Exhibit A, and I'll go over how that's working, simply this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11026)|
| 3:03:52| Dr. McIntyre just spoke to the point that the county was going to give $1.5 million to the schools at our fund balance for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11032)|
| 3:04:02| And he said that it's not needed, he and the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11042)|
| 3:04:07| And so we were very gracious and happy that we already had designated $750,000 of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11047)|
| 3:04:16| So we're going to ask to kind of pull some of that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11056)|
| 3:04:21| But before we do that, what we really want to do is what we have cut back on in recent years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11061)|
| 3:04:27| in IT is replacing hardware in this building and in county facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11067)|
| 3:04:33| And so we're asking for $100,000 for replacement computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| It's needed, and we have kind of neglected that in the past as we have went through some budget struggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11079)|
| 3:04:47| And it came to our attention as well that the sheriff's department is having a new taser, I think, is the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11087)|
| 3:04:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11098)|
| 3:05:01| Is that a higher voltage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11101)|
| 3:05:05| Longer lasting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| It's not the volts, it's the amps that get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| Don't worry about the volts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| What's happening is they're phasing out the old ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11112)|
| 3:05:15| And so for this contract to begin us with the new ones, then this is what this allocation was for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11115)|
| 3:05:21| And also the scanners are when you come in the building at every entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11121)|
| 3:05:26| those are the metal detectors that make sure that we're safe in here every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11126)|
| 3:05:29| So that's the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11129)|
| 3:05:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11132)|
| 3:05:33| So basically that is two years of five of tasers, or about $55,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11133)|
| 3:05:42| And it's one scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11142)|
| 3:05:45| And we're going to work with trying to get a second one later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11145)|
| 3:05:49| And then the third thing that we added was just a contingency of $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11149)|
| 3:05:56| And I added that, and it was for one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| We are starting to get invoices from the state for mental illness patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11158)|
| 3:06:10| And I don't know if it has to do with the closing of Lakeshore or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11170)|
| 3:06:14| but we got a bill in August for $6,200 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| And so we're looking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11178)|
| 3:06:20| But we have things like that that come up occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| And there was something else the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| And so we never budget for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11187)|
| 3:06:31| And so that is something I'd like to include because those things do happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11191)|
| 3:06:36| whether it's a repair at the public defender's office or bills from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11196)|
| 3:06:43| So that was part of my thought process with the contingencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11203)|
| 3:06:47| And then you'll see a negative $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11207)|
| 3:06:50| That is just taking the remaining amount that we had contributed to fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11210)|
| 3:06:57| from fund balance to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| And so that just takes that down to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| So it's actually, I guess, a savings of $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11222)|
| 3:07:05| And also an amendment to a designation that was approved last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11225)|
| 3:07:10| We approved $120,000 for a boom truck for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11230)|
| 3:07:17| I'm talking to Dwight this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| They're not for sure they're going to make that purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| However, if they don't, they would like to purchase some other equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11241)|
| 3:07:25| So I would just like to amend that to say boom truck slash heavy equipment as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11245)|
| 3:07:31| And he has some ideas on how that could be spent in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11251)|
| 3:07:37| And he'll know at the latter part of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11257)|
| 3:07:40| These are all one-time expenditures that we know of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| except maybe the mental health bills from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11263)|
| 3:07:47| And we're checking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| I would ask for you to approve these because we do think that they are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11274)|
| 3:07:55| And all these are included within this resolution, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11277)|
| 3:07:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11278)|
| 3:07:59| So we have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11279)|
| 3:08:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11282)|
| 3:08:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11283)|
| 3:08:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11284)|
| 3:08:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11285)|
| 3:08:06| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11286)|
| 3:08:07| Thank you, Mr. Collin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| Resolution 906 is designating or committing and appropriating funds in the amount of $96,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11288)|
| 3:08:14| from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013 for the purpose of funding phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11294)|
| 3:08:20| of the Knox County Health Department's Flu Mist Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11300)|
| 3:08:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Dr. Buchanan, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11308)|
| 3:08:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11310)|
| 3:08:31| Go ahead, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| Tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11313)|
| 3:08:34| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue, and it's flu mist time in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11314)|
| 3:08:41| So for eight years, this will be our eighth year of flu mist, Knox County Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11321)|
| 3:08:45| Department has given free flu mist to Knox County school children in private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11325)|
| 3:08:51| and public schools as well as daycares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| And in those eight years, we haven't had a closure of schools for flu illness due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11334)|
| 3:09:02| to children in our community when other counties have had issues with closing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11342)|
| 3:09:08| So we believe it's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11348)|
| 3:09:10| It keeps the schools open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11350)|
| 3:09:11| It keeps mom and dad at work, and it keeps grandma well, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11351)|
| 3:09:14| So we believe in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| We've been funding the program for years with a very large grant that we got from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11356)|
| 3:09:20| MedImmune, the company that makes flu mist, all those years ago and have been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11360)|
| 3:09:24| fiscally responsible with that and made it last a really long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| And that money is running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11368)|
| 3:09:30| We have the money from the schools as well as one of our hospital systems and as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11370)|
| 3:09:36| well as money that we have in the coffers still to cover phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| This project cost us anywhere from $400,000 to $600,000, depending on how many kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11381)|
| 3:09:47| we vaccinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11387)|
| 3:09:48| Obviously, it's the number of vaccines you have to buy that drives up the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11388)|
| 3:09:53| We are also, in addition to that, this year going to and hopefully successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11393)|
| 3:09:58| bill for administration of flu mist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| It's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| Dr. Briggs can tell you that it's complicated to bill for services and lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11402)|
| 3:10:06| different rules and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11406)|
| 3:10:07| You have to jump through to do that, but we've been trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| We also added something you approved today with an MOU with MDC so that if a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11410)|
| 3:10:16| logs on to register their kid who has insurance to get a flu shot, then they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11416)|
| 3:10:22| donate some money for a kid who doesn't have insurance because we have quite a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11422)|
| 3:10:28| of those in Knox County to get a flu shot, too, so to keep that funding going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11428)|
| 3:10:33| So the idea is that we've covered phase one, and it's phase two, which cost about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11433)|
| 3:10:38| $96,000, which is when we go back and the children who need a second dose of vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11438)|
| 3:10:43| to be fully protected, the first time you ever get a flu shot, you need two doses to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11443)|
| 3:10:48| be fully protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11448)|
| 3:10:49| And we go back and we do that to a much smaller number of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| Those are kids under nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| And we go back and we get those kids vaccinated and ensure that they're fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11453)|
| 3:10:58| protected from flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11458)|
| 3:10:59| So we're asking for that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| The idea is that we are going to continue to look for different ways to fund this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11462)|
| 3:11:07| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11467)|
| 3:11:08| This project eventually needs to be a public-private partnership where it's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11468)|
| 3:11:13| of a combination of we're billing for the insurance for the kids that we can bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11473)|
| 3:11:17| for, schools contributing, businesses, Walgreens this year is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11477)|
| 3:11:22| partnering with us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11482)|
| 3:11:23| I forgot about that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11483)|
| 3:11:24| They'll be partnering with us to help offer, make options available outside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11484)|
| 3:11:29| school day for kids who want to get a free flu shot, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11489)|
| 3:11:32| So that's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11492)|
| 3:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11494)|
| 3:11:35| Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11495)|
| 3:11:36| I just wanted to say how hard Dr. Buchanan has been working on this to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11496)|
| 3:11:43| all of this funding covered through donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11503)|
| 3:11:48| And I think she's done an amazing job getting as much covered as she has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11508)|
| 3:11:54| I think that, again, for Chris's benefit, is that this is a one-time expense and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11514)|
| 3:12:01| it's a very important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| And as she mentioned, this is for the second round for kids who the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11523)|
| 3:12:08| they get the vaccination they need two doses instead of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11528)|
| 3:12:11| And we've already spent the money that we've gotten to give them the first dose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| And if we don't follow up with that second dose, then we've kind of wasted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| money we spent on the first dose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11538)|
| 3:12:20| So I think it's very important and very necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11540)|
| 3:12:25| Each year, I can say as a parent, each year the county has made this easier and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11545)|
| 3:12:30| easier for families to take part in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11550)|
| 3:12:33| This year I was able to go online and register both of my school-age kids to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11553)|
| 3:12:38| their flu mist online and was able to enter my insurance information so that my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11558)|
| 3:12:44| insurance company will pay to cover Aiden and Avery's flu mist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11564)|
| 3:12:50| And also I was able to make a contribution to cover another child who doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11570)|
| 3:12:54| have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11574)|
| 3:12:55| And when I arrived at school last week to pick up Avery, there was a big sign on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| the school door from the health department that said, pick your nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11579)|
| 3:13:04| And it was about, you know, getting flu protection instead of getting a shot or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11584)|
| 3:13:08| something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11588)|
| 3:13:09| Pick your nose and get a flu mist thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11589)|
| 3:13:13| It's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| I think they do a great job keeping us all healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| We all know that when our kids are healthy, our entire family tends to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11599)|
| 3:13:26| healthy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11606)|
| 3:13:27| So I'm very, very pleased to be able to bring this forward for our health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11607)|
| 3:13:32| department and grateful for the wonderful job they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11612)|
| 3:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11616)|
| 3:13:37| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11617)|
| 3:13:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11618)|
| 3:13:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11619)|
| 3:13:40| What is the understanding that you have with the Metropolitan Drug Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11620)|
| 3:13:43| Are you all going to be doing fundraising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| How is that going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| They have a PayPal account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| And in PayPal, you can divide things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11629)|
| 3:13:52| So when a parent goes and clicks on the link that's on our website and on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11632)|
| 3:13:57| registration, it takes them to a place where they can donate to the school, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11637)|
| 3:14:02| mean, to the health department for the purchase of flu mist for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11642)|
| 3:14:08| And so what will happen is on a regular basis, I think it will be monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11648)|
| 3:14:12| MDC will write us a check for the amount that was donated into that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11652)|
| 3:14:17| MDC won't get any money for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| They don't take any funds for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| PayPal will take their cutoff that they do from MDC anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11661)|
| 3:14:26| We came across a problem trying to get a contract with PayPal for us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11666)|
| 3:14:30| So this was a creative solution to partner with MDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11670)|
| 3:14:33| And they graciously agreed to let us do that in order for parents to easily and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11673)|
| 3:14:38| securely donate money for another kid to get a flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11678)|
| 3:14:41| So we need to create awareness to the public to let them know they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| So it's an easy way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11687)|
| 3:14:48| Now, you say you already have Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| So you already have between $400,000 and $500,000 for Phase 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11693)|
| 3:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11694)|
| 3:14:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11695)|
| 3:14:56| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11696)|
| 3:14:57| Yeah, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| You know, the only suggestion that I would have to make on this, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11699)|
| 3:15:02| keep it brief, is just that why don't we put this in our regular budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11702)|
| 3:15:06| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11706)|
| 3:15:07| I mean, I think I certainly would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| I also think that if we're being fiscally responsible, maximizing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11709)|
| 3:15:14| possibilities of how we can pay for this project are a good thing to do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11714)|
| 3:15:18| So, again, a combination of fundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11718)|
| 3:15:20| So, yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11722)|
| 3:15:23| I had one quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| I wanted to remind everyone that next Monday, someone from the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11725)|
| 3:15:29| department will be here to give us our flu shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11729)|
| 3:15:32| Bring your insurance information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| Yeah, bring your insurance information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| But, please, everybody, if you've not had a flu shot, please come and get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11736)|
| 3:15:39| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11739)|
| 3:15:40| And also, any members of your family can come and get a flu shot that day as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11740)|
| 3:15:44| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11744)|
| 3:15:45| And let's set a great example for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11745)|
| 3:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11749)|
| 3:15:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11750)|
| 3:15:51| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11751)|
| 3:15:52| No, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11752)|
| 3:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11753)|
| 3:15:54| Oh, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11754)|
| 3:15:55| You got another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11755)|
| 3:15:56| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11756)|
| 3:15:57| I thought the e-mail said spouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11757)|
| 3:15:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11758)|
| 3:15:59| Yeah, I mean, that is, I got to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11759)|
| 3:16:01| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11761)|
| 3:16:02| So, we can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| It's not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11764)|
| 3:16:06| We want to protect everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11766)|
| 3:16:08| So, if you guys want to bring your spouses, we can change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11768)|
| 3:16:11| It's not that many more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11773)|
| 3:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11774)|
| 3:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11775)|
| 3:16:16| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11776)|
| 3:16:17| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11777)|
| 3:16:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11778)|
| 3:16:19| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11779)|
| 3:16:20| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11780)|
| 3:16:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11782)|
| 3:16:23| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11783)|
| 3:16:24| Resolution 907 is designating or committing and appropriating funds in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11784)|
| 3:16:28| amount of $500,000 from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013 for the Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11788)|
| 3:16:35| Knox County Community Action Committee, CAC, through the defined services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11795)|
| 3:16:39| contract process to use and disperse to local organizations to help provide free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11799)|
| 3:16:44| or reduced public transportation for seniors and those who are disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11804)|
| 3:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11808)|
| 3:16:49| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11813)|
| 3:16:54| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11816)|
| 3:16:57| And discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| Ms. Royles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| Ms. Royles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11821)|
| 3:17:03| As you all have heard me talk about this for a couple of years now and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11823)|
| 3:17:06| important it is that our seniors have transportation, there is already on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11826)|
| 3:17:14| Knox County Commission Forum a great deal of information that I posted at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11834)|
| 3:17:18| budget time about this particular program and why it is so important and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11838)|
| 3:17:25| needed with our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11845)|
| 3:17:28| There's a lot of reasons why this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11848)|
| 3:17:32| Public safety, independence, keeping seniors from being isolated, and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11852)|
| 3:17:40| them to the care that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11860)|
| 3:17:44| The way it's set up now, we're having to turn down, I believe, based on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11864)|
| 3:17:52| recent two-week survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| We're having to deny an average of 100 requests per week of senior citizens in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11874)|
| 3:18:02| Knox County who need to go to the doctor, who need to go to the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11882)|
| 3:18:08| These are all very important trips for these seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11888)|
| 3:18:13| One thing that CAC has not been able to do up to this point because there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11893)|
| 3:18:17| enough transportation available is our seniors who need cardiac therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11897)|
| 3:18:22| rehab therapy, who need wound care, who need stroke rehab therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11902)|
| 3:18:30| Anything that requires multiple trips a week, it's just been a flat no because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| they just don't have enough trips available to cover those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11914)|
| 3:18:40| And I'm sure you've heard me say this before, but if you're a senior citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11920)|
| 3:18:45| who's able to live independently and you have a stroke and your doctor tells you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11925)|
| 3:18:50| you know, if you can come to therapy three days a week for the next six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11930)|
| 3:18:57| you can regain the use of the right side of your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| You can walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11940)|
| 3:19:01| You can use your right arm again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11941)|
| 3:19:03| For that senior, that's the difference of remaining independent in your own home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11943)|
| 3:19:09| and having or having to move to assisted living or even into a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11949)|
| 3:19:16| We all know the statistics about seniors who are isolated or more likely to fall ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11956)|
| 3:19:22| and they die sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11962)|
| 3:19:25| And what this would do is 400,000 of this would be to provide transportation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11965)|
| 3:19:34| seniors outside the CAT service area and 100,000 would be to provide transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11974)|
| 3:19:42| for seniors within the CAT area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11982)|
| 3:19:45| And I'm going to try to explain this without getting everybody too confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| CAC Transportation and CAT have a non-competition agreement, whereas if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11990)|
| 3:19:56| a senior citizen and your home and your destination are on a CAT bus line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=11996)|
| 3:20:04| you cannot use CAC Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| You have to use CAT Transportation regardless of your income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12006)|
| 3:20:12| If you are a senior citizen who lives on the CAT bus line but your destination is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12012)|
| 3:20:18| somewhere other than on a CAT fixed route, you are eligible for CAC Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12018)|
| 3:20:25| and depending on your income level, that trip can be free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12025)|
| 3:20:30| So right now, the way that it's set up, we are not treating our senior citizens in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12030)|
| 3:20:34| Knox County fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12034)|
| 3:20:36| So what this would do would be allow us to level that out so that all seniors in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12036)|
| 3:20:41| County are receiving the same services and being charged the same amount for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12041)|
| 3:20:47| This is not a reinstatement of the Senior Freedom Program where if you were a senior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12047)|
| 3:20:52| you rode the bus for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12052)|
| 3:20:54| That's not what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12054)|
| 3:20:55| This is a very targeted approach only to the senior citizens who truly need that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12055)|
| 3:21:00| subsidized transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12060)|
| 3:21:04| This amount of money, the $400,000 for senior citizens who live outside the CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12064)|
| 3:21:10| zone, provides about 44 round trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12070)|
| 3:21:14| And that is still not going to cover everyone, but it's going to provide needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12074)|
| 3:21:21| services to people, to our senior citizens, to people who deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12081)|
| 3:21:27| And it would be great if we could cover everybody, but we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12087)|
| 3:21:32| But this is going to make a huge dent in those 100 people a week that we're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12092)|
| 3:21:37| to turn down, and the people who need the multiple trips per week that we're turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12097)|
| 3:21:41| down, and also the people who have been, there are people with disabilities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12101)|
| 3:21:45| senior citizens who have been offered jobs, who want to be self-sufficient and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12105)|
| 3:21:49| want to earn their own money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| And the only thing standing in their way is a lack of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| So this would allow us to provide transportation for those people as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12114)|
| 3:21:59| I do consider this a one-time expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12119)|
| 3:22:02| There's nothing that says we have to continue with this next year or the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12122)|
| 3:22:05| after or the year after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12125)|
| 3:22:07| This is the sort of thing that the need is always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12127)|
| 3:22:11| We will, I don't think we'll ever be able to get completely on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12131)|
| 3:22:14| And whatever we spend each year on CAC senior transportation, they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12134)|
| 3:22:20| take that money and they're going to stretch it as far as they can to cover as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12140)|
| 3:22:24| many people as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12144)|
| 3:22:26| And they will be grateful for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12146)|
| 3:22:28| And it doesn't, it's not setting up a precedent that this will continue next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12148)|
| 3:22:31| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| But we can afford this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| We can afford to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| And our senior citizens in Knox County deserve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12157)|
| 3:22:40| And I'm going to invite Barbara Monte, who runs the Office on Aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12160)|
| 3:22:44| And Barbara Kelly was here earlier, who's in charge of CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12164)|
| 3:22:48| But I believe she had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| Just if anybody has any questions, Barbara could probably do a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12170)|
| 3:22:54| answering them than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| But she's a wealth of information about senior transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| So, please, if you have questions, please ask Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12183)|
| 3:23:04| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12184)|
| 3:23:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12185)|
| 3:23:06| Thank you, Ms. Barbara, for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12186)|
| 3:23:08| What's your current transportation budget currently, senior transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12188)|
| 3:23:12| budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12192)|
| 3:23:15| Barbara, would you state before you do that, do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12195)|
| 3:23:19| I'm Barbara Monte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12199)|
| 3:23:20| I'm the director of the Knoxville-Knox County CAC Office on Aging and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12200)|
| 3:23:25| Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| And my home address is 920 Marlboro Road, Knoxville 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12207)|
| 3:23:33| It's about $3.3 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12213)|
| 3:23:41| The majority of that is contract transportation provided through TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12221)|
| 3:23:49| through some contracts to take people to daycare, adult day programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12229)|
| 3:23:56| to the O'Connor Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| We have only about $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12239)|
| 3:24:09| Karen Estes is the manager, and she's coaching me from back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12249)|
| 3:24:14| $350,000 is our total amount that we have available for what we call public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12254)|
| 3:24:21| transportation or discretionary transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12261)|
| 3:24:24| $223,000 of that is an allocation that's part of the CAC allocation from Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12264)|
| 3:24:31| County that is designated for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12271)|
| 3:24:36| So, out of the $350,000, we are very grateful for the $223,000 of that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12276)|
| 3:24:44| we have in Knox County, and that's what providing these 21, 22 trips a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12284)|
| 3:24:51| that we're now able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12291)|
| 3:24:53| But having to turn away 20 people every day is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12293)|
| 3:24:59| So you're only doing 21 trips a day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| Of the public transportation, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12302)|
| 3:25:05| That's round trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12305)|
| 3:25:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12308)|
| 3:25:10| Okay, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12310)|
| 3:25:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| Of this 100 that you're turning away, how many of them are in the county versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12316)|
| 3:25:20| in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12320)|
| 3:25:23| Probably the majority of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12323)|
| 3:25:25| I would guess somewhere around 65%, at least, would be outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12325)|
| 3:25:33| The people that are inside the city limits generally are going to destinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12333)|
| 3:25:39| that are outside the city limits or they're traveling at times that CAT isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12339)|
| 3:25:45| operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12345)|
| 3:25:46| CAC is running pretty close to 24-7, and CAT has more limited service times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12346)|
| 3:25:54| So that, for example, if somebody is going to work on a 3 to midnight shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12354)|
| 3:26:02| they might be able to get there on a CAT bus, but CAC brings them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12362)|
| 3:26:09| So we try very hard to coordinate our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12369)|
| 3:26:12| But the majority of the people are outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12372)|
| 3:26:16| Does the city put any money into this fund for these, what did you call them, rebel riders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12376)|
| 3:26:25| I don't mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| The ones that are not covered under your program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12387)|
| 3:26:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12389)|
| 3:26:30| The answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12390)|
| 3:26:31| The city funds CAT and their public transportation system, and they have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12391)|
| 3:26:42| provided any funds to CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| But that doesn't, the money they provide to CAT doesn't take care of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12404)|
| 3:26:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12409)|
| 3:26:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12410)|
| 3:26:51| So we're saying, okay, county, you need to take care of all these folks whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12411)|
| 3:26:55| live in the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| Doesn't seem fair to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12421)|
| 3:27:04| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12424)|
| 3:27:06| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12426)|
| 3:27:07| I think Mr. Caldwell said something a while ago that I agree with totally, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12427)|
| 3:27:12| what do you want versus what do you need with the extra funds that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12432)|
| 3:27:16| I see, for example, the $96,000 for FluMist as a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12436)|
| 3:27:21| What happens if we don't do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| And we have our students going home, and we have a lot of sickness that just crowds our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12443)|
| 3:27:29| emergency rooms and crowds our doctor's offices, and we have a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12449)|
| 3:27:33| Second is I want to be very cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| However, again, what do you need versus what do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12456)|
| 3:27:41| I see this as a need after talking about it and after taking a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12461)|
| 3:27:46| And one of the things that has really gotten me is this word isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12466)|
| 3:27:51| When you have people who can't drive or they need transportation to an event or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12471)|
| 3:27:58| doctor's visit or therapy, whatever, and they don't have that transportation, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12478)|
| 3:28:04| hard to ask people over and over and over again to drive you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12484)|
| 3:28:08| And so most people just won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| And so as a result, they stay, and they're isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12490)|
| 3:28:13| It really hit home to me, for example, this few months ago when my sister had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12493)|
| 3:28:18| brain tumor, which was not cancerous, but it has impaired her vision to the point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12498)|
| 3:28:23| she can't drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12503)|
| 3:28:24| And if it were not for transportation in Kingsport, Tennessee, she wouldn't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12504)|
| 3:28:28| simple things like go to church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12508)|
| 3:28:30| She works in the cafeteria there at her church every day, but she's able to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12510)|
| 3:28:34| transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12514)|
| 3:28:35| And we could say, well, it's up to the family to take care of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12515)|
| 3:28:38| And they do, and we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12518)|
| 3:28:40| But there's only so much that you can do without forcing someone into isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12520)|
| 3:28:46| And so these senior citizens, and this is for our seniors, they have paid their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12526)|
| 3:28:52| We are here because of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12532)|
| 3:28:54| And so I see this as not a want, but a need, since it is one-time funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12534)|
| 3:28:59| So I will be voting in favor of this, because I definitely see this as something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12539)|
| 3:29:04| need to do for our seniors, because I just think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12544)|
| 3:29:08| And we're in a situation where I think we can do it, and it's not going to impact us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12548)|
| 3:29:12| in a negative fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12552)|
| 3:29:14| And I think that the good that we will do in our community will far outweigh anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12554)|
| 3:29:18| else that we could do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12558)|
| 3:29:21| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12561)|
| 3:29:22| And I would like to remind all of us that the time may come when we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12562)|
| 3:29:29| I'm reaching the point where I recognize that the days are probably numbered that I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12569)|
| 3:29:34| able to drive, and it can happen to you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12574)|
| 3:29:39| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| I don't know if Amy mentioned it this time or not, but before CAC was receiving a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12581)|
| 3:29:49| from the Mercy System before they went out of business, would you share with us how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12589)|
| 3:29:53| that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12593)|
| 3:29:55| That was right around $200,000 a year that when Tenova acquired that Mercy, they apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12595)|
| 3:30:06| were informed by Medicare that they were not legally able to continue to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12606)|
| 3:30:15| And so effective April 1st, it just ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12615)|
| 3:30:20| And we were serving that during the nine months from last July through March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12620)|
| 3:30:27| We did well over 5,000 trips, serving 650 people through that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12627)|
| 3:30:35| I wanted to bring that out, the point being is that the level of service that's provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| now is not equal to what the service was a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12639)|
| 3:30:44| And just to go over these numbers again, did you say that now you're making 21 round trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12644)|
| 3:30:50| a day, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12650)|
| 3:30:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12652)|
| 3:30:53| And I think what I heard Amy say is if we fund this, the full amount that's being requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12653)|
| 3:30:59| it will go up to 44, or is it 44 additional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12659)|
| 3:31:01| It will be 44 additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12661)|
| 3:31:03| So it will go from 21 to 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12663)|
| 3:31:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12666)|
| 3:31:07| And it would be like a miracle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| You know, a couple of things I'd probably like to further illustrate in what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12673)|
| 3:31:20| Briggs and Hammond discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12680)|
| 3:31:24| You know, these folks are taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12684)|
| 3:31:27| I mean, they're all county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12687)|
| 3:31:30| I mean, they're 100% of them are county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12690)|
| 3:31:34| They're not just city taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12694)|
| 3:31:36| It's just like trying to keep this in a box is, in my mind, is similar to the flu miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12696)|
| 3:31:42| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12702)|
| 3:31:43| There's nothing that says our children are in school so they have to get flu miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12703)|
| 3:31:47| But it's like I said, well, let's just give the county students flu miss and not give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12707)|
| 3:31:53| the city students flu miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| We have a challenge in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| The challenge is how we're going to deal with our aging population regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12717)|
| 3:32:02| One of the things we have to keep in mind, this whole dynamic is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| Commissioner Brown has a huge hospital, huge hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12726)|
| 3:32:11| It's dormant now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12731)|
| 3:32:13| So those folks now are going out to West Knoxville to go to hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12733)|
| 3:32:19| They're going from the city, from the city out to West Knoxville, from the city out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12739)|
| 3:32:24| North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12744)|
| 3:32:25| That's my dad's hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12745)|
| 3:32:26| He lives in Burlington, but his hospital is in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12746)|
| 3:32:29| So the whole transportation dynamic, we can't keep it in a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12749)|
| 3:32:33| We are, you know, we're a very integrated county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12753)|
| 3:32:39| I don't want to say metropolitan because we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12759)|
| 3:32:42| So don't get me wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12762)|
| 3:32:43| But we really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12763)|
| 3:32:44| I mean, you know, we're kind of interweaved all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12764)|
| 3:32:50| So, you know, this is a needed program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12770)|
| 3:32:53| I like Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12773)|
| 3:32:55| I'm just starting to deal with, you know, some transportation issues with seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12775)|
| 3:33:01| And generally speaking, those family members, I let the family take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12781)|
| 3:33:06| All of us are worker bees, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12786)|
| 3:33:08| So we have our nine-to-fives, which is when a lot of these activities and services take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12788)|
| 3:33:14| So these are, this is a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12794)|
| 3:33:17| It's actually, you know, it's a strong program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12797)|
| 3:33:20| And that's, I do look at this as one-time funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12800)|
| 3:33:23| But I do encourage commissioners to strongly consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12803)|
| 3:33:28| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12808)|
| 3:33:30| Barbara, tell me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12810)|
| 3:33:31| You're looking right now, you're spending, you've got about 21 people that you do a day, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12811)|
| 3:33:37| Well, I have to just explain that we do have an additional about an average of about 18 people a day that we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12817)|
| 3:33:45| In addition to those 21, we take to dialysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12825)|
| 3:33:48| And we sort of take those out of the picture because that is a life-threatening service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12828)|
| 3:33:55| And so we do take an average of the 21 plus the 18 that are going to dialysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12835)|
| 3:34:01| But the dialysis trips are our top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12841)|
| 3:34:05| And you're wanting to do an additional 23 is what you're needing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12845)|
| 3:34:08| We want to do an additional 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12848)|
| 3:34:13| The $400,000 would provide about an additional 44 round trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12853)|
| 3:34:23| And we're now, as I say, we're turning away the 20, an average of 20 a day that we're just saying, you know, we can't take you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12863)|
| 3:34:32| And in addition to that, since March, we've identified 32 people that needed to go to these multiple trips a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12872)|
| 3:34:44| They needed to go to Patricia Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12884)|
| 3:34:46| They needed to go to Fort Sanders West, to Nova North for these therapies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12886)|
| 3:34:57| And we haven't been able to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12897)|
| 3:34:59| And these are not trips that they can do on CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12899)|
| 3:35:03| But we've got here before it's $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| So what's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12905)|
| 3:35:08| As I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12908)|
| 3:35:09| It's supposed to be $400,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12909)|
| 3:35:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12911)|
| 3:35:12| What do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12912)|
| 3:35:14| It's $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12914)|
| 3:35:17| Right now, $300,000 will get them up to where they started from, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12917)|
| 3:35:25| When they lost the Tenova contract and when the seniors' CAT program ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12925)|
| 3:35:31| So $300,000 is just going to get them back up to where they were at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12931)|
| 3:35:35| And then the extra $200,000 is going to allow them to take another 22 round trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12935)|
| 3:35:42| Now, what we've got, the $100,000 that we've got allocated for seniors who live and are going to destinations on the CAT system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12942)|
| 3:35:52| it's not that if you're a senior, you ride free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12952)|
| 3:35:55| These are targeted only towards those seniors who are living in subsidized housing below the poverty level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12955)|
| 3:36:03| who need free transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12963)|
| 3:36:05| Because if they didn't live on CAT, they could get free transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12965)|
| 3:36:08| So right now, we're treating our seniors inequitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12968)|
| 3:36:11| Some seniors get free or reduced transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12971)|
| 3:36:15| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12975)|
| 3:36:16| If you live on the CAT line, sorry, you don't, which I think is terribly unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12976)|
| 3:36:21| I'd also like to point out, you know, I live within the city limits, but I'm also a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12981)|
| 3:36:27| And it's very frustrating for those of us who, and in my district, I represent people who live in the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12987)|
| 3:36:34| and I represent people who live outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12994)|
| 3:36:37| And it's very frustrating for us, some of us here, when we hear, well, how many of these people live in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=12997)|
| 3:36:44| Well, all of them live in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13004)|
| 3:36:46| Every single one of them live in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13006)|
| 3:36:48| And every single one of them, for the most part, have paid county taxes their entire lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13008)|
| 3:36:55| And now they're seniors and they're dependent upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13015)|
| 3:36:58| And so are we going to do what we can for them or are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13018)|
| 3:37:02| And as far as the city and what they pay, the city does not pay for CAC transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13022)|
| 3:37:09| but they do pay for case management through CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13029)|
| 3:37:13| The county does not pay a dime towards CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13033)|
| 3:37:18| But the city pays heavily for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13038)|
| 3:37:22| So it's, you know, there's kind of a tradeoff there between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13042)|
| 3:37:26| And it would be what we're trying to do, and CAC has been doing this for years and is doing a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13046)|
| 3:37:32| is we're trying to integrate those two systems so that all of our seniors in Knox County are treated the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13052)|
| 3:37:39| no matter where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| And so that if they desperately need transportation to the doctors, to the grocery store, to the pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13061)|
| 3:37:49| they can get that without feeling like they're being a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13069)|
| 3:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13075)|
| 3:37:56| Dennis Rose, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13076)|
| 3:37:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13077)|
| 3:37:58| Go ahead, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13078)|
| 3:37:59| You still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13079)|
| 3:38:00| Take a breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13080)|
| 3:38:04| Barbara, so how's this going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13084)|
| 3:38:06| If somebody, they have to call you guys to say, hey, this is, I need to go to the doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13086)|
| 3:38:12| I need to go to the store, whatever, is this, how does somebody, how's this going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13092)|
| 3:38:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13097)|
| 3:38:18| For the money that Commissioner Broyles has set aside for, to subsidize people who ride on the CAT system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13098)|
| 3:38:28| this will be for seniors, as I understand it, over age 65, who qualify through financial need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13108)|
| 3:38:36| to have their trip subsidized on the fixed route system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13116)|
| 3:38:43| We're also trying, and I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13123)|
| 3:38:46| So what percentage of your money is going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13126)|
| 3:38:48| That would be $100,000 will be set aside to subsidize riders on the CAT system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13128)|
| 3:38:54| both on the fixed route, and we're also trying to find a way to subsidize the people who use the CAT lift system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13134)|
| 3:39:03| which is a paratransit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| Well, I thought we had this before, and the mayor had in there $50,000, and nobody was doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13145)|
| 3:39:10| But that was for any senior to ride free on the CAT fixed route system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13150)|
| 3:39:18| We're now talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13158)|
| 3:39:19| That's what this $100,000 is, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13159)|
| 3:39:21| $100,000 will be not for any senior to ride free, only for those who qualify under low-income guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13161)|
| 3:39:30| And plus, as I say, we're working on trying to find a way that people who are over 65 or disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13170)|
| 3:39:41| can ride on the fixed route for 60 cents each way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13181)|
| 3:39:48| which is half, I think, what it costs for a younger person to ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13188)|
| 3:39:54| The people who ride on the CAT lift have to pay $3 each way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13194)|
| 3:40:00| and that's for people who really aren't able to use the fixed route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13200)|
| 3:40:05| And for someone who's low-income, that $6 round trip can be a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13205)|
| 3:40:11| So we're trying to figure out a way to help those people, too, with that $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13211)|
| 3:40:17| That would be part of this allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13217)|
| 3:40:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13219)|
| 3:40:20| The other $400,000 would be for CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13220)|
| 3:40:24| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13224)|
| 3:40:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13225)|
| 3:40:26| It's just what concerns me, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13226)|
| 3:40:27| You know, this is going to come back to us again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13227)|
| 3:40:30| We say it's a one-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13230)|
| 3:40:31| It's not going to be a one-time scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13231)|
| 3:40:33| We got other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13233)|
| 3:40:34| We're getting these things that are coming to us on the very day that we're voting, several of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13234)|
| 3:40:39| Everybody's asking for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| And I just got mixed feelings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| I mean, everybody's got worthy projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13243)|
| 3:40:46| Everybody does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13246)|
| 3:40:47| And that just bothers me that we come here the day of a meeting and all of a sudden these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13247)|
| 3:40:52| you know, we're spending $850,000, just bam, bam, bam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13252)|
| 3:40:56| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13256)|
| 3:40:58| Mr. Henders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13258)|
| 3:41:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13260)|
| 3:41:01| Going back to some of my questions, we talked about dialysis patients that were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13261)|
| 3:41:06| Does TennCare not pay these BLS ambulance companies gobs of money for transportation to dialysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13266)|
| 3:41:14| Those people who are eligible, they have to meet income and need eligibility requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13274)|
| 3:41:21| to be qualified under TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| An awful lot of people go into dialysis who do not qualify with a very low income requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13283)|
| 3:41:30| but for whom that amounts to $18 a week to have to go three times a week on the lift can be a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13290)|
| 3:41:38| Does it so private insurance, say somebody retires from an entity that has insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13298)|
| 3:41:43| so private insurance doesn't have transportation like TennCare has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13303)|
| 3:41:46| I'm not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13306)|
| 3:41:49| Medicare does not cover transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13309)|
| 3:41:52| Most, I'll tell you, most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13312)|
| 3:41:54| There may be some rare cases, but most of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13314)|
| 3:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13316)|
| 3:41:57| I just kind of want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13317)|
| 3:41:58| And another question is, we're taking people, we're asking the county to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13318)|
| 3:42:04| And I'm kind of mixed on this because it's, there's so many entities doing this already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13324)|
| 3:42:10| and so I'm kind of, I'm just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13330)|
| 3:42:12| We're asking the county to fund transportation to and from work for somebody that's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13332)|
| 3:42:18| While they're a senior or not, we're asking them to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13338)|
| 3:42:21| Is that what part of your program is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13341)|
| 3:42:24| We receive, or at least we have been receiving, a federal grant called Job Access Reverse Commute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13344)|
| 3:42:32| And we have designated those funds for employment and employment-related transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13352)|
| 3:42:41| And we do have a waiting list for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13361)|
| 3:42:45| Whether or not we would be able to serve any additional people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13365)|
| 3:42:50| I think that would have to be, we'll continue to look for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13370)|
| 3:42:55| additional federal dollars for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13375)|
| 3:42:57| But that's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13377)|
| 3:42:58| You were talking about it a while ago, and so I was just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13378)|
| 3:43:00| I mean, I think you were talking about your programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13380)|
| 3:43:01| and maybe not what this money would be allocated to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13381)|
| 3:43:03| But it kind of got my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13383)|
| 3:43:05| You spoke to it a while ago about some people, we take them to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13385)|
| 3:43:09| Yes, that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13389)|
| 3:43:10| If they're working 3 to midnight, CAT's taking them there, and we're taking them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13390)|
| 3:43:14| He was asking me about the people in the city that we transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13394)|
| 3:43:18| And you're right, that was with the Job Access funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13398)|
| 3:43:22| So what would qualify somebody for the program that you're asking us to fund here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13402)|
| 3:43:28| What's the qualifications for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| For the $100,000 that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13411)|
| 3:43:36| Do you mean for the jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| No, no, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13418)|
| 3:43:39| Yes, we mean for the CAC transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13421)|
| 3:43:42| The $400,000 that you're asking for, for on your side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13422)|
| 3:43:45| what qualifications are there for that program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13425)|
| 3:43:50| They have to need transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13430)|
| 3:43:53| They have to need transportation and not be able to get where they need to go on CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13433)|
| 3:44:00| Because we do, you know, we look at that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13440)|
| 3:44:03| If they are on TennCare, then TennCare pays for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13443)|
| 3:44:08| But there are, and this is not, and it's not income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13448)|
| 3:44:15| It's not income related because we do ask people who can afford it to pay a fare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13455)|
| 3:44:23| But we have funds, some funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13463)|
| 3:44:28| This is more than you ever wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13468)|
| 3:44:32| No, it's not, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13472)|
| 3:44:35| These funds that we call the public funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13475)|
| 3:44:38| the discretionary funds that aren't a contract saying pick up this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13478)|
| 3:44:42| and take them there at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13482)|
| 3:44:44| Some of the money, it comes from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13484)|
| 3:44:47| There's $223,000, and it's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| It's for any Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13489)|
| 3:44:52| But we also include in there some funds that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13492)|
| 3:44:55| that are specifically only for serving the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13495)|
| 3:44:59| in the very sparsely populated rural parts of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13499)|
| 3:45:04| We have some funds that come from the Older Americans Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13504)|
| 3:45:07| that are just for serving people over age 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13507)|
| 3:45:10| And then we have another, it's about $50,000 from CSBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13510)|
| 3:45:16| $50,000 that is specifically for serving low-income people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13516)|
| 3:45:21| So we put all of those together, and that's what we're able to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13521)|
| 3:45:26| And that's the $350,000 a year that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13526)|
| 3:45:29| that we can use to take, and sort of as a safety net,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13529)|
| 3:45:35| the Knox County, since it will serve anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13535)|
| 3:45:38| if they don't fit in, if they aren't over 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13538)|
| 3:45:40| if they don't live the far corners of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13540)|
| 3:45:44| and if they aren't low-income, we've still got the Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13544)|
| 3:45:48| And there are, I'm sure you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13548)|
| 3:45:52| there are almost 60% of our total population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13552)|
| 3:45:57| lives outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13557)|
| 3:46:00| And they have very little but CAC to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13560)|
| 3:46:03| I had a question in my mind, but what all...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13563)|
| 3:46:10| We don't call those senior moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13570)|
| 3:46:13| Too young for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13573)|
| 3:46:16| It's a brown moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13576)|
| 3:46:18| What qualifies, or what kind of trips do you take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13578)|
| 3:46:22| We take a lot of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13582)|
| 3:46:24| Under this program, what kind of trips would you take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13584)|
| 3:46:26| A lot of them are trips to the doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13586)|
| 3:46:28| for medical appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13588)|
| 3:46:30| We would, we hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13590)|
| 3:46:32| there's one of the things we'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13592)|
| 3:46:34| is to be able to take these multiple trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13594)|
| 3:46:37| to post-stroke therapy, to post-cardiac therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13597)|
| 3:46:43| That's been the hardest thing, I think, to say no to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13603)|
| 3:46:48| are these people who need to take the multiple trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13608)|
| 3:46:52| So the majority of the trips would be medical-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13612)|
| 3:46:57| But getting somebody to the grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13617)|
| 3:47:03| getting somebody to visit their spouse in a nursing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13623)|
| 3:47:08| taking somebody to the food stamp office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13628)|
| 3:47:14| to apply for food stamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13634)|
| 3:47:17| We call them essential errands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13637)|
| 3:47:22| That's the kind of trips they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13642)|
| 3:47:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13644)|
| 3:47:26| Mr. Shells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13646)|
| 3:47:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13648)|
| 3:47:29| Just a little editorial comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13649)|
| 3:47:31| I do, I live in the city, so I do want to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13651)|
| 3:47:35| that city taxpayers do pay a lot of county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13655)|
| 3:47:38| And if they don't have kids in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13658)|
| 3:47:40| sometimes it's hard to justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13660)|
| 3:47:42| what they're getting back from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13662)|
| 3:47:44| because normally they use KPD and the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13664)|
| 3:47:48| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13668)|
| 3:47:50| Barbara, let me ask you, 44 trips a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13670)|
| 3:47:54| is that five days a week, six days a week, or seven days a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13674)|
| 3:47:58| That's five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13678)|
| 3:48:00| We do take people on the weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13680)|
| 3:48:02| so it's just easier to think about our peak days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13682)|
| 3:48:06| Just doing the math quick on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13686)|
| 3:48:08| that comes to $35 a trip to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13688)|
| 3:48:10| I guess that's $17 or $18 each way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13690)|
| 3:48:12| That seems a little bit high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13692)|
| 3:48:14| Unless the guy's out there in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13694)|
| 3:48:16| Well, there's not cab service in Corrington, is there, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13696)|
| 3:48:19| I mean, that's about a cab trip fare, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13699)|
| 3:48:23| Cab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13703)|
| 3:48:25| You're not an expert on that, nor am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13705)|
| 3:48:27| I just wanted to point out it seems high to be $35 a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13707)|
| 3:48:31| It's round trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| It's about $18 one-way average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13713)|
| 3:48:37| And as you say, some of them are shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13717)|
| 3:48:39| Knox County's a big county, if you hadn't noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13719)|
| 3:48:43| And I think the cab lift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13723)|
| 3:48:49| which operates only within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13729)|
| 3:48:53| has a trip rate of closer to $24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13733)|
| 3:48:57| Now, I don't have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| They don't publicize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| That's the rate that they have to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13741)|
| 3:49:04| actually pay for, not what the rider pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13744)|
| 3:49:06| That's the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13746)|
| 3:49:08| And again, that's why in our CIC trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13748)|
| 3:49:12| people don't generally pay the full cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13752)|
| 3:49:15| We ask them to pay the ones who can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13755)|
| 3:49:18| $3 each way, the same that they would pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13758)|
| 3:49:21| if they were riding on the lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13761)|
| 3:49:28| I didn't mean to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13768)|
| 3:49:30| I just want to emphasize that it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13770)|
| 3:49:32| I just wanted to do the division quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13772)|
| 3:49:35| You did good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13775)|
| 3:49:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13777)|
| 3:49:39| Okay. All right. Thank you, Mr. Monning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| Mr. Monning, we've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13781)|
| 3:49:44| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13784)|
| 3:49:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13786)|
| 3:49:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13788)|
| 3:49:50| I'd like to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13790)|
| 3:49:52| And so we have one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13792)|
| 3:49:54| Do we have any nos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13794)|
| 3:49:57| One no, one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13797)|
| 3:50:02| Okay. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13802)|
| 3:50:04| Thank you, Mr. Monning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13804)|
| 3:50:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13806)|
| 3:50:12| Resolution 908 is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13812)|
| 3:50:15| Resolution 908 is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| designating or committing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13817)|
| 3:50:19| and appropriating funds in the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| of $300,000 from fiscal year 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| to fiscal year 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13823)|
| 3:50:25| to provide for the design and placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13825)|
| 3:50:27| of a senior center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13827)|
| 3:50:29| in the northwest section of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13829)|
| 3:50:31| I'm going to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13831)|
| 3:50:33| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13835)|
| 3:50:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13837)|
| 3:50:39| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13839)|
| 3:50:41| Yeah, we've talked about this for a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13841)|
| 3:50:43| The meeting with the mayor, it's been in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13843)|
| 3:50:45| since I've been elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13845)|
| 3:50:47| and so I was kind of given that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13847)|
| 3:50:49| ultimatum when I was elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13849)|
| 3:50:51| by the citizens of my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13851)|
| 3:50:53| that it's the only area in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13853)|
| 3:50:55| not served by the senior centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13855)|
| 3:50:57| and has no senior programming out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13857)|
| 3:50:59| Currently, we're going to try to build it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13859)|
| 3:51:01| on county land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13861)|
| 3:51:03| Mayor and I and Hugh Holt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| and Ms. Hemel went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| and looked at a few places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13867)|
| 3:51:09| and this $300,000 would go toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| the development, if so granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13871)|
| 3:51:13| And the design, we're going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| to use the Carter footprint, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13875)|
| 3:51:17| and save some money on the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13877)|
| 3:51:19| Could cost up to total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13879)|
| 3:51:21| in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13881)|
| 3:51:23| It'll be a capital appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13883)|
| 3:51:25| for next year to finish it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13885)|
| 3:51:27| You know, maybe another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13887)|
| 3:51:29| $800,000 or $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13889)|
| 3:51:31| So that's my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13891)|
| 3:51:33| I'd appreciate you guys to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13893)|
| 3:51:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13895)|
| 3:51:37| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13897)|
| 3:51:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13900)|
| 3:51:42| I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13902)|
| 3:51:44| A question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13904)|
| 3:51:46| operational question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13906)|
| 3:51:48| Are we going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13908)|
| 3:51:50| to support this on existing staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13910)|
| 3:51:52| Are we going to spread the staff out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13912)|
| 3:51:54| within the senior work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13914)|
| 3:51:56| the employees that work there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13916)|
| 3:51:58| I don't know if Hemel can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13918)|
| 3:52:00| I mean, it takes about $80,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13920)|
| 3:52:02| to function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13922)|
| 3:52:04| on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13924)|
| 3:52:06| I mean, the halls and senior centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13926)|
| 3:52:08| are larger, but it has more programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13928)|
| 3:52:10| It's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13930)|
| 3:52:12| But it's well used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| I mean, there's not a day it's not full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13934)|
| 3:52:16| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13936)|
| 3:52:18| on average, they cost about $80,000 to $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13938)|
| 3:52:20| operational, and Hemel would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13940)|
| 3:52:22| an increase in her operational budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13942)|
| 3:52:24| in the next budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13944)|
| 3:52:26| not this budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13946)|
| 3:52:28| Okay. Yeah, I just want to get the fullness of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13948)|
| 3:52:30| But, no, this, you know, this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13950)|
| 3:52:32| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13952)|
| 3:52:34| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13954)|
| 3:52:36| This is a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13956)|
| 3:52:38| I don't know if Hemel or the mayor are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13958)|
| 3:52:40| but we're going to try to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13960)|
| 3:52:42| a private-public partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13962)|
| 3:52:44| with some of the health companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13964)|
| 3:52:46| some of the providers in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13966)|
| 3:52:48| and hopefully it'll be a senior wellness center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13968)|
| 3:52:50| activity center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13970)|
| 3:52:52| hopefully a little different than the rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| but same services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| So these funds will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13976)|
| 3:52:58| for development, design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13978)|
| 3:53:00| and partial build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13980)|
| 3:53:02| Because it says placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13982)|
| 3:53:04| location, whatever Hugh needs to pick a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13984)|
| 3:53:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| Paying people to do environmental phase one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13989)|
| 3:53:11| and things like that on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13991)|
| 3:53:13| It's more or less, this $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13993)|
| 3:53:15| I don't think we'll use it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13995)|
| 3:53:17| during design and placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13997)|
| 3:53:19| but that'll roll into construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=13999)|
| 3:53:21| Ms. Brules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14003)|
| 3:53:25| do you know how many seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14005)|
| 3:53:27| in your area will be able to use this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| I think it'll go to capacity pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14009)|
| 3:53:31| I don't know what Hemel gets on most of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| but it'll be similar to Carter and Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| It'll go to capacity pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14015)|
| 3:53:37| And I don't know the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| It's going to be modeled after the Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14019)|
| 3:53:41| Whatever Carter gets in visitors, we'll probably get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14021)|
| 3:53:43| Wherever you put it, it's going to be a capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14023)|
| 3:53:45| They will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14025)|
| 3:53:47| One of the things I wanted to make sure of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14027)|
| 3:53:49| is like with the string,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14029)|
| 3:53:51| it's not big enough, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| for the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14033)|
| 3:53:55| And so I want to make sure if we're going to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14035)|
| 3:53:57| that we do it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14037)|
| 3:53:59| and make sure that it's big enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14039)|
| 3:54:01| that seniors are going to be using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14041)|
| 3:54:03| And won't it be wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14043)|
| 3:54:05| if they have transportation there and back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14045)|
| 3:54:07| So I'm very much in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14047)|
| 3:54:09| of making sure that we have the same opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14049)|
| 3:54:11| in your district for our seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14051)|
| 3:54:13| that we have around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14053)|
| 3:54:15| The spot that we're looking at right now is expandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| So if we come down two or five years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14057)|
| 3:54:19| and it looks like it needs more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14059)|
| 3:54:21| you know, another 1,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| we can probably add that to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14063)|
| 3:54:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14065)|
| 3:54:27| Brad, I wholeheartedly support you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14067)|
| 3:54:30| I also said the same thing up in the high school community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14070)|
| 3:54:32| You know, he has promised those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14072)|
| 3:54:34| pretty much the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14074)|
| 3:54:36| Not near as big, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14076)|
| 3:54:38| you need something as big as what they've got at Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14078)|
| 3:54:40| depending on where you put the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14080)|
| 3:54:42| This one will serve ball camp, Hardin Valley, Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14082)|
| 3:54:44| Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14084)|
| 3:54:46| It'll be smack dab in the middle of all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14086)|
| 3:54:48| And so it could be as large as the Halls one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14088)|
| 3:54:50| and function well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14090)|
| 3:54:52| You'll need to add staff to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14092)|
| 3:54:54| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14094)|
| 3:54:56| Is anybody keeping a running total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14096)|
| 3:54:58| for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14098)|
| 3:55:00| Yeah, we're right at a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14100)|
| 3:55:02| Mr. Caldwell probably is keeping a total right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14102)|
| 3:55:04| I can't speak for the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14104)|
| 3:55:06| but he was not objectionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14106)|
| 3:55:08| There was no objections to him in our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14108)|
| 3:55:10| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14110)|
| 3:55:12| I'm not going to sit here and say that he's all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14112)|
| 3:55:14| And come Monday, he may come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14114)|
| 3:55:16| with a different number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14116)|
| 3:55:18| How much have we spent all together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14118)|
| 3:55:20| So far, $896,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14120)|
| 3:55:22| What I'm looking at is the $1.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14122)|
| 3:55:24| that we're not going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14124)|
| 3:55:26| to fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14126)|
| 3:55:28| Anyway, that's kind of in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14128)|
| 3:55:30| what I'm thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14130)|
| 3:55:32| Whether I'm right or wrong, it's in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14132)|
| 3:55:34| You know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14134)|
| 3:55:36| I'm going off track here just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14136)|
| 3:55:38| but we're talking about the crowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14138)|
| 3:55:40| at the Strang Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14140)|
| 3:55:42| I mean, I'm sure they'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14142)|
| 3:55:44| to have a new center someplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14144)|
| 3:55:46| but we've been trying to get a parking lot down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14146)|
| 3:55:48| I mean, the people down there can't park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14148)|
| 3:55:50| They've got to park on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14150)|
| 3:55:52| and come up the street in their walkers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14152)|
| 3:55:54| to get to the Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14154)|
| 3:55:56| You know, and I don't want to make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14156)|
| 3:55:58| you know, a West versus East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14158)|
| 3:56:00| or anything else thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14160)|
| 3:56:02| but, you know, the people out where we live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14162)|
| 3:56:04| are the ones that pay the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14164)|
| 3:56:06| We're the ones that build the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14166)|
| 3:56:08| in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14168)|
| 3:56:10| We're the ones that build the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14170)|
| 3:56:12| in the 6th District as part of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14172)|
| 3:56:14| But it just seems like there's such a maldistribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14174)|
| 3:56:16| of what people sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14176)|
| 3:56:18| and what they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14178)|
| 3:56:20| It's going to be the people that live out where we live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14180)|
| 3:56:23| are the ones that are going to be paying for the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14183)|
| 3:56:25| And at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14185)|
| 3:56:27| it seems like we could at least be equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14187)|
| 3:56:29| I mean, we're not asking for anything more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14189)|
| 3:56:31| We'd like just to have what everybody else has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14191)|
| 3:56:33| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14193)|
| 3:56:35| We don't have a place to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| Commissioner Briggs, I really encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14197)|
| 3:56:39| to bring that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14199)|
| 3:56:41| It hadn't been brought forward since Craig Luther was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14201)|
| 3:56:43| I'm with you. I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14203)|
| 3:56:45| Me, too. I would totally support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| But you're going to have to bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14207)|
| 3:56:49| It's in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14209)|
| 3:56:51| and you're going to make me angry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| by the comments you made preceding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14213)|
| 3:56:55| Well, if you want to know the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| it's been brought forward for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14217)|
| 3:56:59| And I don't know if Dwight left or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14219)|
| 3:57:01| but we thought we were going to get somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| to pay for the parking lot out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14223)|
| 3:57:05| And we've had trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14225)|
| 3:57:07| We've had trouble out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14227)|
| 3:57:09| When the mayor comes out, I was out there with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14229)|
| 3:57:11| at budget time two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14231)|
| 3:57:13| We were out there this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14233)|
| 3:57:15| and nothing came of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14235)|
| 3:57:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14237)|
| 3:57:19| We have any other lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| Mr. Smith, you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14243)|
| 3:57:25| Our motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14245)|
| 3:57:27| Motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14247)|
| 3:57:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14249)|
| 3:57:31| I didn't say all in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14251)|
| 3:57:33| but all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14253)|
| 3:57:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14255)|
| 3:57:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| I'm going to pass on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14259)|
| 3:57:41| Okay. We have one pass and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14261)|
| 3:57:43| Wait a minute. I'm going to change mine to a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14263)|
| 3:57:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14265)|
| 3:57:48| Any other votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14268)|
| 3:57:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14274)|
| 3:57:56| So we have two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14276)|
| 3:57:58| So the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14278)|
| 3:58:18| Resolution 909| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14298)|
| 3:58:20| is designating or committing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14300)|
| 3:58:22| and appropriating funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14302)|
| 3:58:24| in the amount of $55,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14304)|
| 3:58:26| from fiscal year 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14306)|
| 3:58:28| to fiscal year 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14308)|
| 3:58:30| for the purpose of providing $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14310)|
| 3:58:32| in discretionary funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14312)|
| 3:58:34| for each of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14314)|
| 3:58:36| 11 Knox County commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14316)|
| 3:58:38| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14318)|
| 3:58:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14320)|
| 3:58:42| And I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14322)|
| 3:58:44| Well, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14324)|
| 3:58:46| I'll pull that. I'll say let's pass it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14326)|
| 3:58:48| with that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14328)|
| 3:58:50| if my second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14330)|
| 3:58:52| I guess what I want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14332)|
| 3:58:54| in general with this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14334)|
| 3:58:56| and I have a couple of copies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14336)|
| 3:58:58| as in two here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14338)|
| 3:59:00| so I didn't make enough for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| but Jill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14342)|
| 3:59:04| passed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14344)|
| 3:59:06| the Knox County non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14346)|
| 3:59:08| funding policy and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14348)|
| 3:59:10| everyone's familiar with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14350)|
| 3:59:12| last sheet was the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14352)|
| 3:59:14| discretionary funding sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14354)|
| 3:59:16| that we would fill out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14356)|
| 3:59:18| for our organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14358)|
| 3:59:20| So why am I bringing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14360)|
| 3:59:22| here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14362)|
| 3:59:24| A couple of reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14364)|
| 3:59:26| and, you know, primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14366)|
| 3:59:28| what I wanted and we've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14368)|
| 3:59:30| about it a little bit in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14370)|
| 3:59:32| is, you know, the advertising cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14372)|
| 3:59:34| oftentimes outweighed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14374)|
| 3:59:36| the actual monies that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14376)|
| 3:59:38| giving out and that is an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14378)|
| 3:59:40| and very kind of not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14380)|
| 3:59:42| you know, taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14382)|
| 3:59:44| I do think the discretionary funding is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14384)|
| 3:59:46| I mean, in no way, shape, form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14386)|
| 3:59:48| or fashion do I consider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14388)|
| 3:59:50| any kind of slush fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14390)|
| 3:59:52| election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14392)|
| 3:59:54| I don't think anybody's been elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14394)|
| 3:59:56| because they gave away $200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14396)|
| 3:59:58| to a band of boosters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14398)|
| 4:00:00| So what I've tried to say in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14400)|
| 4:00:02| is well, let's pare it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14402)|
| 4:00:04| Let's make sure we get only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14404)|
| 4:00:06| tax exempt non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14406)|
| 4:00:08| and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14408)|
| 4:00:10| associated with school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14410)|
| 4:00:12| you know, band boosters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14412)|
| 4:00:14| football boosters, those type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14414)|
| 4:00:16| of entities, PTAs, PTSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14416)|
| 4:00:18| So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14418)|
| 4:00:20| what I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14420)|
| 4:00:22| to try to push forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14422)|
| 4:00:24| You know, it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14424)|
| 4:00:26| I know everyone says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14426)|
| 4:00:28| that's the business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14428)|
| 4:00:30| and to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14430)|
| 4:00:32| I want to say what Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14432)|
| 4:00:34| said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14434)|
| 4:00:36| Yeah, it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14436)|
| 4:00:38| It's great to have someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14438)|
| 4:00:40| who's running at a profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14440)|
| 4:00:42| running in the black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14442)|
| 4:00:44| and get some funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14444)|
| 4:00:46| When you're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14446)|
| 4:00:48| some of the other parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14448)|
| 4:00:50| of our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14450)|
| 4:00:52| particularly within my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14452)|
| 4:00:54| one, two, three, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14454)|
| 4:00:56| I keep on going down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14456)|
| 4:00:58| I may skip five and parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14458)|
| 4:01:00| of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14460)|
| 4:01:02| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14462)|
| 4:01:04| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14464)|
| 4:01:06| It's $50 per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14466)|
| 4:01:08| It also gives to at large folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14468)|
| 4:01:10| I mean, they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| giving away $20, $50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14472)|
| 4:01:14| but those help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14474)|
| 4:01:16| They help these small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14476)|
| 4:01:18| organizations that don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14478)|
| 4:01:20| enough wherewithal to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14480)|
| 4:01:22| together a defined services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14482)|
| 4:01:24| contract come first of next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14484)|
| 4:01:26| year, you know, and appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14486)|
| 4:01:28| to HUE and go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14488)|
| 4:01:30| the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14490)|
| 4:01:32| That's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14492)|
| 4:01:34| to where I would think, you know, if we could do something, I don't know if we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14494)|
| 4:01:37| something similar to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| So I'm going to ask, that's why I didn't know whether to bring this in the form of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14499)|
| 4:01:45| at this point, a discussion item, because I'm going to ask our law director and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14505)|
| 4:01:51| Buke to try to see if this will pass the muster of not having to put all this in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14511)|
| 4:01:59| And so again, I have copies and it says it within our policy, we'll probably have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14519)|
| 4:02:04| update the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14524)|
| 4:02:05| I don't know if you all have one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14525)|
| 4:02:09| You know, and even within the policy, it doesn't say 501c3, it says only 501c4 organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14529)|
| 4:02:15| So you know, I do think the policy stands in need of some updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14535)|
| 4:02:19| I don't know how old it is, but you know, again, this is, so I'm going to move that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14539)|
| 4:02:24| we pass this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14544)|
| 4:02:26| I'm going to ask the law department to kind of look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14546)|
| 4:02:29| I do think that they'll look into it with some sharper eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14549)|
| 4:02:32| I don't know how much momentum it got prior to, I know Commissioner Hammond had tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14552)|
| 4:02:36| at one point, but so that's my resolution that I'm proposing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14556)|
| 4:02:42| Mr. Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14562)|
| 4:02:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14563)|
| 4:02:44| You know, I would normally have probably been opposed to this, but I want to use one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14564)|
| 4:02:50| Dave's sayings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14570)|
| 4:02:51| Me and the junior staff member at my house went to the library, and as you guys know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14571)|
| 4:02:59| most of my money went to schools and libraries when we had discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14579)|
| 4:03:03| The librarian there, and I can't remember her name, and I'm sorry for that, but she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14583)|
| 4:03:09| continues every time that Addison and I go to the library or we check something out or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14589)|
| 4:03:13| whatever, she continues to tell me what she still has as part of that discretionary money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14593)|
| 4:03:17| that I gave her, and she's using it for summer reading programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14597)|
| 4:03:21| She has 125 to 200 kids every program that she brings, and so I would be against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14601)|
| 4:03:28| but seeing the things that you can do with that, I'd probably support this, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14608)|
| 4:03:33| I think if you use it wisely, it's a good thing, and we got to help support the graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14613)|
| 4:03:40| celebrations for all our high schools, and here comes Chris to tell us we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14620)|
| 4:03:45| And his head is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14625)|
| 4:03:46| But, you know, it's something that allows us as commissioners to meet the needs in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14626)|
| 4:03:52| district and to do things that are worthwhile, and so we can call them slush funds, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14632)|
| 4:03:58| you want to, but what I gave to the library two, three years ago is still being in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14638)|
| 4:04:03| and I think it's a good use for those kids to be a part of those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14643)|
| 4:04:08| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14648)|
| 4:04:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14650)|
| 4:04:12| Just a question, and you can do what you want to do, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14652)|
| 4:04:16| I would have asked this every time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14656)|
| 4:04:19| Is this a recurring expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14659)|
| 4:04:21| I'm asking, you know, I would think that this body needs to talk about this probably March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14661)|
| 4:04:29| April time frame about, I'm not proposing a recurring expense, but I would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14669)|
| 4:04:34| I'm not looking at this with blinders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14674)|
| 4:04:35| No, it's not a recurring, but I'm anticipating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14675)|
| 4:04:39| I would say I will put something on the agenda discussion item to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14679)|
| 4:04:43| You know, let's give it six months, five, six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14683)|
| 4:04:45| Do we want to continue with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14685)|
| 4:04:46| So, that's how I would put it, but today's, this resolution would be a one-time only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14686)|
| 4:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14690)|
| 4:04:51| I might want to get up here and say that I'm against anything, especially seniors, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14691)|
| 4:04:58| just take into account that the information I gave you today on sales tax, and we're adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14698)|
| 4:05:06| these things to the budget, if the hall income tax comes in lower next year, health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14706)|
| 4:05:13| is higher, and next year we're not going to have a surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14713)|
| 4:05:19| We're going to probably have a deficit and be using some fund balance, so just keep that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14719)|
| 4:05:25| in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14725)|
| 4:05:26| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14726)|
| 4:05:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14727)|
| 4:05:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14728)|
| 4:05:29| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14729)|
| 4:05:30| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14730)|
| 4:05:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14731)|
| 4:05:32| It's another historic moment tonight, because I'm agreeing with my friend on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14732)|
| 4:05:38| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14738)|
| 4:05:39| By the way, you've been very well behaved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14739)|
| 4:05:42| Well, the day's not over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14742)|
| 4:05:44| Is that a light on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14744)|
| 4:05:46| Your light has been on every time you want to speak, so very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14746)|
| 4:05:52| Almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14752)|
| 4:05:53| Those of you that were on commission when we had a discretionary fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14753)|
| 4:06:03| how many of you have not had any requests since the discretionary funds were taken away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14763)|
| 4:06:13| You didn't have any to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14773)|
| 4:06:19| You have not had any requests, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14779)|
| 4:06:25| Well, maybe out there in that rich part of the county that you mentioned a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14785)|
| 4:06:28| they don't need it, so they don't come ask you for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14788)|
| 4:06:30| I'm sorry I didn't mean that in that way, but from what you said a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14790)|
| 4:06:33| I took a little bit of an umbrage at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| Well, I could respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14795)|
| 4:06:38| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14798)|
| 4:06:39| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14799)|
| 4:06:40| I spoke too soon, didn't I, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14800)|
| 4:06:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14801)|
| 4:06:42| My light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14802)|
| 4:06:43| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14803)|
| 4:06:44| You have the floor, but we can't be, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14804)|
| 4:06:46| You told me not to speak without my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14806)|
| 4:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14808)|
| 4:06:49| You've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14809)|
| 4:06:50| You've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14810)|
| 4:06:51| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14811)|
| 4:06:52| You did that on purpose, so I forget what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14812)|
| 4:06:55| You're like Morrison Butt Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14815)|
| 4:06:59| Well, Sam is right in this, that these little nonprofits and little school PTAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14819)|
| 4:07:10| the booster clubs and whatever that we invested in over those years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14830)|
| 4:07:14| when we had a discretionary income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14834)|
| 4:07:17| number one, they'd have to probably pay somebody to fill out the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14837)|
| 4:07:22| and it would cost them more to get the paperwork filled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14842)|
| 4:07:24| than it would for the $200 or whatever they're going to get out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14844)|
| 4:07:27| Now, I just finished, and I'm not saying, and I hope that I'm not sticking my neck out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14847)|
| 4:07:32| to get a thousand phone calls tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14852)|
| 4:07:34| but my phone calls didn't stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14854)|
| 4:07:38| Matter of fact, they didn't slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14858)|
| 4:07:41| And I've tried to, in a lot of ways, and I could show you if you want to look at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14861)|
| 4:07:49| accommodate as many of these as I could out of my own pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14869)|
| 4:07:53| And I'm not tooting my own horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14873)|
| 4:07:55| I just did my income tax here this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14875)|
| 4:07:58| and I know exactly how much money that I put back out there into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14878)|
| 4:08:03| And it's not just one or two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14883)|
| 4:08:06| There's about 24 different places it went over this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14886)|
| 4:08:11| And I'm not bragging on that myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14891)|
| 4:08:14| but like Sam said, they are the little people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14894)|
| 4:08:19| We keep talking about helping the little people and the old people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14899)|
| 4:08:23| Some of these folks really need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14903)|
| 4:08:27| but they can't go through the grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14907)|
| 4:08:30| Who knows better where it can be used the best in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14910)|
| 4:08:34| than the commissioner in the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14914)|
| 4:08:37| So that's all I'm saying, is that I think this needs to be put back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14917)|
| 4:08:42| so that we can help some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14922)|
| 4:08:45| Now, I will continue to do my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14925)|
| 4:08:47| I'll guarantee that, because I feel like it's my part to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14927)|
| 4:08:51| But it would be nice to have some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14931)|
| 4:08:53| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14933)|
| 4:08:55| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14935)|
| 4:08:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14937)|
| 4:08:59| It's difficult to follow the last couple of speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14939)|
| 4:09:03| in that really what I had to say I thought could be humorous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14943)|
| 4:09:08| but now I don't know whether it is or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14948)|
| 4:09:10| I'll take your money, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14950)|
| 4:09:12| You will notice that Commissioner Anders commented about his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14952)|
| 4:09:21| And his staff car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14961)|
| 4:09:25| Apparently, we both have a staff car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14965)|
| 4:09:28| but he has senior staff and junior staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14968)|
| 4:09:31| and I want you to know I only have one staff member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14971)|
| 4:09:34| so he apparently has more staff than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14974)|
| 4:09:42| Others? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14982)|
| 4:09:44| And I'd like to remind the body to direct their comments not towards each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14984)|
| 4:09:50| And through the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14990)|
| 4:09:52| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14992)|
| 4:09:54| You know, one of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14994)|
| 4:09:56| as we've spent almost a million dollars tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14996)|
| 4:09:59| is, you know, what we're forgetting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=14999)|
| 4:10:01| this is the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15001)|
| 4:10:03| And that's something that it's really easy to forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15003)|
| 4:10:06| when you have this money out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15006)|
| 4:10:08| and we're sort of handing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15008)|
| 4:10:10| I mean, this money belongs to somebody else that sacrificed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15010)|
| 4:10:14| I mean, if we really have things out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15014)|
| 4:10:16| maybe we ought to be cutting taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15016)|
| 4:10:18| to cap the money that paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15018)|
| 4:10:20| And rather than all of these, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15020)|
| 4:10:23| the problem is when we start giving money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15023)|
| 4:10:25| to too many of these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15025)|
| 4:10:27| it takes away their motive to go down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15027)|
| 4:10:29| and have to ask to go to the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15029)|
| 4:10:31| and ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15031)|
| 4:10:33| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15033)|
| 4:10:35| But why should they go ask if somebody's going to give it to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15035)|
| 4:10:39| And I find it, you know, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15039)|
| 4:10:42| you know, this is what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15042)|
| 4:10:45| I mean, you go down to the businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15045)|
| 4:10:48| you ask them, you see if they can't put up $200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15048)|
| 4:10:50| to sponsor the Little League team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15050)|
| 4:10:52| They can't put up money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15052)|
| 4:10:54| I would really like to see a lot of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15054)|
| 4:10:57| you know, government-private collaboration on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15057)|
| 4:11:02| I mean, it's almost a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15062)|
| 4:11:04| I mean, we did it, you know, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15064)|
| 4:11:06| Mercy was doing that with the senior transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15066)|
| 4:11:08| I think senior transportation was a very good program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15068)|
| 4:11:10| because we're doing something there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15070)|
| 4:11:12| that really can't be provided entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15072)|
| 4:11:14| by the private community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15074)|
| 4:11:16| But it was being subsidized significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15076)|
| 4:11:18| by the private side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15078)|
| 4:11:20| which was the Mercy system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15080)|
| 4:11:22| And, I mean, it's just too bad that Tenova can't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15082)|
| 4:11:24| and it's too bad that Covenant can't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15084)|
| 4:11:26| and that the old BABDA system couldn't do it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15086)|
| 4:11:29| But there's other organizations that can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15089)|
| 4:11:31| But sometimes it does take a little work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15091)|
| 4:11:33| and you have to go ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15093)|
| 4:11:35| And, you know, and I don't mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15095)|
| 4:11:37| and again, I'm not talking to anyone here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15097)|
| 4:11:39| but some of the people who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| well, we don't have the businesses to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15101)|
| 4:11:43| we don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15103)|
| 4:11:46| Sometimes we don't have a business-friendly environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15106)|
| 4:11:48| and there's a reason that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15108)|
| 4:11:50| put their businesses out west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15110)|
| 4:11:52| and they're not putting their businesses someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15112)|
| 4:11:54| And it has to do with the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15114)|
| 4:11:56| that people welcome business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15116)|
| 4:11:58| and the way that people say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15118)|
| 4:12:00| you're not welcome in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15120)|
| 4:12:02| And, again, this is the taxpayers' money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15122)|
| 4:12:04| that we're spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15124)|
| 4:12:06| And I think we need to remember it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15126)|
| 4:12:08| when, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15128)|
| 4:12:10| when we've spent a million dollars tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15130)|
| 4:12:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15132)|
| 4:12:14| Our lights are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15134)|
| 4:12:16| We have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15136)|
| 4:12:18| the motion is for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15138)|
| 4:12:20| We got a lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15140)|
| 4:12:22| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15142)|
| 4:12:24| The motion is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15144)|
| 4:12:26| send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15146)|
| 4:12:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15148)|
| 4:12:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15150)|
| 4:12:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15152)|
| 4:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15154)|
| 4:12:36| Is that enough time for you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15156)|
| 4:12:38| I hate to, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15158)|
| 4:12:40| We've still got a couple more items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15160)|
| 4:12:42| Mr. Boyles, yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15162)|
| 4:12:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15164)|
| 4:12:46| He passed on the 55th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15166)|
| 4:12:48| Passed on the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15168)|
| 4:12:50| on the last motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15170)|
| 4:12:52| Okay, on the no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15172)|
| 4:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15174)|
| 4:12:56| Staff, give you a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15176)|
| 4:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15178)|
| 4:13:00| And the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15180)|
| 4:13:02| the next discussion item, is it on audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15182)|
| 4:13:04| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15184)|
| 4:13:06| Mr. Wright, did you have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15186)|
| 4:13:09| Mike's out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15189)|
| 4:13:11| I guess that's what you wanted to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15191)|
| 4:13:13| primarily, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15193)|
| 4:13:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15195)|
| 4:13:17| The audit committee did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15197)|
| 4:13:19| meet and there were three or four things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15199)|
| 4:13:21| and I was just thinking that between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15201)|
| 4:13:23| the audit committee members that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15203)|
| 4:13:25| took a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15205)|
| 4:13:27| we needed to maybe say that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15207)|
| 4:13:29| received two or three audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| One being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15215)|
| 4:13:37| transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15217)|
| 4:13:39| law director transitioning to the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15219)|
| 4:13:41| law director and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15221)|
| 4:13:43| it was a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| and clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15225)|
| 4:13:47| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15227)|
| 4:13:49| the report was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15229)|
| 4:13:51| good, or the audit was good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15231)|
| 4:13:53| the way I took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15233)|
| 4:13:55| There was also a follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15235)|
| 4:13:57| on the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15237)|
| 4:13:59| school activities fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15239)|
| 4:14:01| sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15241)|
| 4:14:03| saying things were under control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15243)|
| 4:14:06| but we keep getting year over year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15246)|
| 4:14:08| the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15248)|
| 4:14:10| results and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15250)|
| 4:14:12| whether that can be fixed or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15252)|
| 4:14:14| there's recommendations that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15254)|
| 4:14:16| to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15256)|
| 4:14:20| What else did we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15260)|
| 4:14:22| We talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15262)|
| 4:14:24| what Chris spoke about today at length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15264)|
| 4:14:26| on the surplus and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15266)|
| 4:14:28| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15268)|
| 4:14:30| there's an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15270)|
| 4:14:32| making a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| at the difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15274)|
| 4:14:36| an internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15276)|
| 4:14:38| and then contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15278)|
| 4:14:40| for that particular service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15280)|
| 4:14:42| outsourcing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15282)|
| 4:14:44| That RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15284)|
| 4:14:46| can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15286)|
| 4:14:48| give us sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15288)|
| 4:14:50| timeline? This is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15290)|
| 4:14:52| a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15292)|
| 4:14:54| or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15294)|
| 4:14:56| any of those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15296)|
| 4:14:58| it's just something that's being looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15298)|
| 4:15:00| to see if we're getting our money's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15300)|
| 4:15:02| and what might be the best practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15302)|
| 4:15:04| and we'll probably take a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15304)|
| 4:15:06| to work our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15306)|

| 4:15:45| My anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15345)|
| 4:15:47| it would open up sometime around the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15347)|
| 4:15:49| of October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15349)|
| 4:15:51| and then the evaluation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15351)|
| 4:15:53| would follow at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| and we'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15355)|
| 4:15:57| how the cards fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15357)|

| 4:17:51| business with the Insolvency Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15471)|
| 4:17:53| that will be forthcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15473)|
| 4:17:55| in a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15475)|

| 4:18:05| We have our 18B tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15485)|
| 4:18:07| was almost a year ago. It'll be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15487)|
| 4:18:09| couple of months, but I wanted to be ahead of the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15489)|
| 4:18:11| since the commission was reorganized. I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15491)|
| 4:18:13| Chairman Norman was now chairman of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15493)|
| 4:18:15| and knew he was chairman of the Insolvency Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15495)|
| 4:18:17| We'll have some properties that we'll need to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15497)|
| 4:18:19| and I'd like to get with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15499)|
| 4:18:21| at an appropriate time just to kind of bring you up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15501)|
| 4:18:23| on what we're doing with respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15503)|
| 4:18:25| to the county and our community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15505)|
| 4:18:27| I'm meeting with Becky Gibson in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15507)|
| 4:18:29| and just to let you know a lot of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15509)|
| 4:18:31| we're doing on vacant and blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15511)|
| 4:18:33| because that all impacts that and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15513)|
| 4:18:35| Commissioner Broyles is well aware of my interest in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15515)|
| 4:18:37| both locally and statewide, but thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15517)|
| 4:18:39| very much. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15519)|
| 4:18:41| I think we have maybe one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15521)|
| 4:18:43| announcement and I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15523)|
| 4:18:45| all. Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15525)|
| 4:18:47| I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15527)|
| 4:18:49| at least two separate announcements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15529)|

| 4:19:07| the dinner, the state delegation dinner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15547)|
| 4:19:09| we've got a caterer, a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15549)|
| 4:19:11| caterer that's going to do that for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15551)|
| 4:19:13| and myself and Ron Haynes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15553)|
| 4:19:15| are going to pay for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15555)|
| 4:19:17| If you guys don't mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15557)|
| 4:19:19| like a pork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15559)|
| 4:19:21| roast, is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15561)|
| 4:19:23| Is that objectionable to anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15563)|

| 4:19:51| Tea Room and despite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15591)|
| 4:19:53| comments that he made earlier, it all depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15593)|
| 4:19:55| on when Dr. Briggs is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15595)|
| 4:19:57| to me because I still want to be friends with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15597)|

| 4:20:01| so when he looks at his schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120917?start=15601)|
