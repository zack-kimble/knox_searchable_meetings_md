| 0:00:26| And Commissioner Smith is here, just to account him present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| So nine members are present. We do have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=29)|
| 0:00:33| Mr. Jarrett, would you lead us in the Pledge of the Flag, please, if you'd rise, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=33)|
| 0:00:37| I will, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=38)|
| 0:00:53| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=53)|
| 0:01:01| Are there amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| Would anyone like to make any amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| I'd like to add a resolution that Section 2.03 of the charter be offered to the voters to change the size of commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=70)|
| 0:01:21| We will have that added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=81)|
| 0:01:28| Also, Commissioner Broyles, who is not here, I talked with her earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| She has asked that the discussion regarding a salary survey be sent on to the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=92)|
| 0:01:40| and I believe that is item number 39, or be sent on to our meeting on Monday, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=100)|
| 0:01:49| as opposed to not the next work session, but the meeting on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| I'd like to add the additional one of them transfers that I passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| It's clearing up some negative balances at your end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| If not, do I hear a motion that we approve or that we add those things that need to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| and delete those things that need to be deleted and change those that need to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Next item is approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| I have a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| This is a proposed consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| So as I read the numbers, if you'd like to pull anything off, please feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| I'm suggesting that we place on consent number 5, number 7, number 8, number 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=155)|
| 0:03:01| Let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Number 10 has been withdrawn, so that will not be placed on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| Now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| It said deferred from July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| Are we hearing that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| I thought it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| The superintendent may want to come and speak to it, but I think it's going to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| This is the flooring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| It's going to be withdrawn, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| That number 10 is going to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| So it is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| We want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Consent number 17, number 18, number 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 32, 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=206)|
| 0:03:53| Would anyone like to remove anything from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| On item number 30, Commissioner Burroughs has asked that she believes some people will be here to speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| and that they be allowed to speak when we get to that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| That's on the Bell-Morris situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Item 7 and 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Item 12, 17, 19, and 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=256)|
| 0:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| I think you got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| That was item 8, but that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| So do I have a motion that those items be placed on consent other than those that have been asked to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| So those will be placed on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Clerk, our first item, number 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| On page 2, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| 1, appointing, recommended by the East Tennessee Chapter of Institute of Internal Auditors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| and recommended by the Knoxville Chapter of the Tennessee Society of Certified Public Accountants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| and reappointing Commissioner Amy Broyles, Commissioner Ed Schaus, Commissioner Dave Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| to the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| This is Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Commissioners, Mr. Walls tells me that those two organizations will be meeting in the near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| and that they will be submitting us names for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| So we have no names today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| What we could vote on is reappointing Commissioners Broyles, Schaus, and Wright to the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| if they so choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| Commissioner Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Yes, I would accept the appointment and responsibility thereto if approved by Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| I would just ask Joe Jarrett to elaborate briefly on the term limit situation that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=349)|
| 0:05:58| Have we not served two terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| I think we're okay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| I'd just like for you to touch on it briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| Myself and Dave, Amy came in late there because she replaced Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| What your policy has been, what you codified, was that you're limited to two terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| unless there's no one interested and qualified to serve in that stead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| Then that person would step aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| So if there's no one, in other words, there are certain commissions and committees and boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| that require a certain expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| And that's why you've allowed yourself that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| I just didn't want to make the association say I'm the only one qualified to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| I don't feel that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Many of my colleagues can sit on the audit committee and do a very good job, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| Well, let's say, for instance, sir, you served two four-year terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| and you decided you wanted to serve a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| And another commissioner said, well, I'd like to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Then the process would be for you to step aside and allow that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| Because I will have served, I guess, and Dave, correct me, we will have served four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| because we served from the fall of 2008 through now, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| So I certainly would accept the position if nominated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| and would appreciate the confidence of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| I just wanted to put that on the table, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Mr. Rideney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| If anyone needs to stay on the audit committee, it is Commissioner Shoust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| because he is the expert that's seated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| Then I thank the law director for his eloquent words of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| if anyone else would like to be on the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| if there's some way I could push you onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| I say that I really appreciate being able to serve on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| But if there is someone else that would like to be on the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| please feel free to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| I would like to see that, I don't know whether you want to call it change or rotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| or maybe it would be new vigor and a new committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| But if not, I am proud to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Are there any other commissioners that would like to serve on the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| I would like to make a motion to split the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| and then keep the three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| The motion has been made and seconded that we split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| and that we go ahead and vote on the commissioners to be reappointed to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| All those in favor of splitting say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Now we have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| The three commissioners are Broyles, Shoust, and Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Do we need to vote on them individually, Mr. Law Director, or can we vote on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| No, if there's no other applicants, unless someone is going to object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| you can certainly vote on all three at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| Do we have a motion that we appoint all three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| That motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| And as we said, Mr. Walz tells us that the other two organizations are meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| and that they will be getting us some names shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I guess I want to get a definition of shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| Should we defer this second piece for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| or should we just pass it on and we'll get something before Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I don't want to rush the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| The IA board meets a week from Thursday, which will be after the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| so you could probably defer it until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Yes, that may be a better motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| so I move that we defer the second part of this newly created resolution for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| So we'll take that up on the September agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Chairman, we may need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Richard, we have an audit meeting scheduled on September 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| So we may need to postpone that, but I'll talk to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| I guess I'm vice chair as we speak, so we'll probably postpone that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Item number six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| approving the appointment of Michael Edwards to the Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| of the Development Corporation of the County of Knox, Resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| I just had a question as to the appropriateness of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| Is this not a commission's responsibility to nominate such a seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| Mr. Edwards, do you want to address this or Mr. Napier and talk about this came out of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| Development Corporation meeting at our last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| If you could give us your name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Todd Napier, 17 Market Square, number 201 Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| The Development Corporation's bylaws and charter set up that the appointment comes as a nomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=663)|
| 0:11:13| of the Development Corporation to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| And this board, by majority vote, can vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| If they vote it down, then we have to come back with another nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| can vote that up or down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| And then the third candidate will take the seat without an up or down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| Can you explain the process that the board went through with Mr. Edwards was the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| the CEO of the Development Corporation, and now we've split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Explain the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| So back about ten years ago, when Mayor Ragsdale, then Mayor Ragsdale, took office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=703)|
| 0:11:51| one of the things he wanted to do was to better unify economic development efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| And to do that, he appointed or asked for Mike Edwards to be appointed the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| and CEO of the Development Corporation as an unpaid CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| And then he was also then standing CEO of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| And so, you know, that's been going on, and I think it's worked very well that we cooperate very well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| And that role is no longer necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| And, you know, Mike can speak to this if you'd like him to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| But another thing this will help do is to clarify the fact that the Development Corporation is not a subset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| It's its own board, its own organization, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| So this will help to clarify that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| But we still have a very good working relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| And then there was a nominating committee of the Development Corporation that put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| and felt like that Mike would be a good addition to the Development Corporation board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Sandy Martin's terms expired to take her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| And then we have Mr. Clayton, who has resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| He had one year left on his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| And that will be a nomination of Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| It will also be coming before you, I would expect, in the next month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Thanks, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| I understand that the Development Corporation is somewhat concerned, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=796)|
| 0:13:25| about a blending of the Chamber and the notion of what the Development Corporation is and does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=805)|
| 0:13:35| You know, and I acknowledge Mr. Edwards' experience in the business community and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| But it seems like a choice of him would actually confuse things even more to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=822)|
| 0:13:53| Now, I'm just giving you, you know, a view from maybe an ordinary citizen's view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| And so I guess my question is, in the nominating committee process, were there other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=839)|
| 0:14:07| And who were those nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Or were there nominations that you can speak of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| There were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| And how did that discussion go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Well, I think they vetted out and believed that Mike was very qualified to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| And it would be a nice transition for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| He would be one of 11 board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| He would not be the President and CEO of the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| So it's a very he's one of 11 votes on any particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| And I think it I don't believe that it confuses the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| Certainly, I can understand where there would have been confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| And there was when Mike was serving as President and CEO of both organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| He's up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Who is he representing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Is it the Chamber of Development Corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| I think Mike did his best to clarify what role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| or what hat he was wearing when he was up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| But, still, I can see how that would have led to confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Mr. Edwards, would you mind speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=898)|
| 0:15:13| Mike, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square, Oxford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| Mike, just give me your take on this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| Did you feel conflicted or did you feel like why would you feel like this is a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| both for the Chamber and for the Development Corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| Let me go back just a little more about historically when, as Todd mentioned 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=933)|
| 0:15:44| and the Chamber each has different roles, but they've got to work very closely to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=944)|
| 0:15:55| in order to have a successful economic development mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| They didn't communicate very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| And then Mayor Ragsdale had the idea of moving it under the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| The Chamber would have been not the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| It's not an operating company in the sense that PDC is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| But the idea was if it shared a common CEO, then communications or silos would not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=978)|
| 0:16:31| And, you know, that was 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| And I can tell you that we have not experienced that in years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| and really in any of the time we've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| It's not uncommon practice for Chamber either officers or CEOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1003)|
| 0:16:52| Blount County is a very good example that the head of the Blount County Chamber sets on its IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| It's not something that is out of the ordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| And it is intended to be able to bring a broad range of insight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1027)|
| 0:17:16| just as it is to have county commissioners set on the development core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| This is, I mean, this is for general background knowledge, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| You piqued my interest in the process by which this seat is put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| So my question is how is that process codified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| You bring one up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| You bring another up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| You bring a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| There's no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Is it codified in our resolutions and documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| No, it's in the articles that set up the development corporation itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| It's back in our charter when it was set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| And I think sort of the reason for that is you've got three county commissioners already set on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1088)|
| 0:18:16| plus the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| And so this development corporation is ultimately a nonprofit charitable organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| It works on behalf of Knox County to do economic development efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| But it can't be a subset of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| It works on behalf of when we come before you every year, you know, and ask for our funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| We go to the mayor, you know, get that approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| So if the county commission had control of every bit of it, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| it would put politics completely into everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| Oh, I agree 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| I'm just trying to understand how that what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Because my second question is to the law director is I don't disagree necessarily with that happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| but shouldn't that be somehow codified in our process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| I mean, you know, if we are doing this, we have the responsibility of voting this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| Shouldn't there be something that says we agree with this 2-2, then 1, we don't get to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| You know, processes, this seems kind of weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| Well, sir, it's more of a policy than a legal, you know, conundrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| But the bottom line is, you know, you've created, first of all, you know, you've created the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| And as such, you can dictate the terms and conditions of membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| But my point is when you're dealing with something like the IDB, that is a joint city-county collective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| So in terms of actually refining their terms and conditions and policies, that would be a joint effort on the two entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1192)|
| 0:20:01| And just for clarification, it's not the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| It's the Development Corporation of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| The Industrial Development Board is a separate organization, which is a component unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| And it is all of their members are nominated and appointed by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| I mean, to maybe go to your point, I mean, if someone up here got, you know, a little crossways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1219)|
| 0:20:29| they could argue the point of, you know, why don't I get to vote the third person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| And, again, I'm just not for any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| It just seems kind of weird that we don't have something in our process that says we agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| Maybe that's a better way of putting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| So, you know, my understanding is that was set up intentionally to prevent this thing from going on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| And ultimately to the best political appointee being put onto this board was that the Development Corp would bring a nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1255)|
| 0:21:03| They would bring a couple of nominees and work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| But, ultimately, if they had the final say, then, you know, we could keep going on and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| until a political appointee was put onto the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| So, you know, I wasn't around when it was completely, you know, when this was put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| But that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| So, you know, again, just to pull that string, could you bring the same nominee three times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| So that's codified and that's in you all's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Let me explain just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| And I guess I could take the heat on some of this because I am on the nominating committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| And I don't believe you two are, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| I couldn't remember if Brad was or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| And let me explain just a little bit about what the thought process was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| And I think it was accurate what Todd and Mike felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| And it goes back historically when Mayor Ragsdale was still in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| is that there needed to be more collaboration and cooperation between the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| and the chamber because in the past it had actually been a lack of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1325)|
| 0:22:12| and maybe even conflicts because they were, the connection just wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| And that historically is how the president and CEO of the chamber also wore the dual hat of president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| and CEO of the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| To give you an idea of some of the members of the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| it really has a substantial elected official presence on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| You have the three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| You have the mayor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| You have the mayor of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| And you also have the mayor of Farragut, who is a nonvote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| He's an ex-officio nonvoting member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| And when the committee met, we put up on the board, what, maybe 15 names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| And we talked about why people would be good candidates or not be good candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| And, incidentally, Mr. Edwards stepped out while we did all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| He was not there to listen to the discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| And our feeling was that we needed to maintain that connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| and liaison between the development corporation and the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| because obviously the chamber is a stakeholder in the recruitment of businesses into the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| and also on the land use for businesses that come into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| And that's why we felt that he needed to be on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| At the same time, of the names that were remaining on the board, we went through each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| And these will be a name that will be recommended to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| He can either or I think we were going to do three names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| We were going to send three names to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| And he could either choose from one of those or he could reject those entirely and pick someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| So we felt that it was a fairly reasonable process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| We also felt that the chamber still needed to have a seat at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| since they are a stakeholder involved in business recruitment and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| And also, part of this is not just business recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| It's also expansion of existing businesses in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| And that would certainly be a role that the chamber would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| And that was the thought process about what was going on with why we recommended who we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1465)|
| 0:24:36| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| And I understand some of that rationale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| especially this connectivity, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| And is it true that there's no one else on the board of directors from the development corporation who's a member of the chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1488)|
| 0:24:58| Todd may be able to answer that because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| I suspect they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| But just as a member of the chamber, they don't necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| They're not carrying the will of the chamber necessarily in a direct way the way Mr. Edwards would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| And this is all I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| And thank you, Mr. Napron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Thank you, Mr. Edwards, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| But I feel like the business community is somewhat inbred in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| And I think that especially in terms of the chamber and its perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| obviously I have some real difficulties with some of the practices of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| And so, anyway, I think that variety and new blood and these types of things are good for boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1534)|
| 0:25:43| And on that basis, I'll object to this and I'll be voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| We have one person, Commissioner Norman, has voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Authorizing the acceptance of grant funding in the amount up to $39,611.65| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| requires a local match of $20,388.35 for the Tennessee Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| for the Family Resource Center Program for the 2012-13 school year resolution 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| I was asking if we had a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Yes, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| I need to ask a question or two about this of the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| I know this is the same number of dollars that were in the budget last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| It's the last sort of phrase, Family Resource Center Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| And if we look at number 19, which is another one that I took off of consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| also uses that family life education term, Family Resource Center Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| What are the needs that are being identified by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| or the goals that this funding helps you all with, or how do you measure it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Mr. Chairman, Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| This is a grant from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| It was actually originally taken out of the budget in the initial proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| but then put back in by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| And its purpose really is to ‑‑ it's not curricular in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| Its purpose is to simply engage parents in the educational process of their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| So this grant will help us to really help to engage parents in meaningful ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| in the education of their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| and to help meet the six standards that the state has adopted actually as statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| in terms of being family‑friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| and working hard to engage our parents in the education of their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| There's a needs assessment component that we're required to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| if we are to accept these dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| And it will allow us to just enhance the work that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| in bringing our parents into the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| in meaningful ways to support their children in their learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| And then, Mr. Chair, that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| But we do raise another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| You were looking for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Do these require motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| This is just discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| We always have to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Yeah, when you pull it off consent, it requires a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| When you pull it off consent, we have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Yeah, we have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| And if we vote it down, it's not really going to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| But it's a procedural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| That was my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Dr. McIntyre, this number 7 and then what he alluded to there, also number 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| is the state, are they going to take their money away next year, do you feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Or what's, I say if you get caught holding the bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| You know, I think what we look at, you know, this funding was almost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| as I said, defunded this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| What we're taking this as a one-year opportunity to really look a little differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| about these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| In the past, this has been a fairly narrowly defined program that we've utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| to support about a half dozen schools and just reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| family reading nights and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| What we're looking at this year is an opportunity to look at these resources more broadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| and to see if we can leverage these dollars to help us with the district-wide effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| around family engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| And so could it go away at the end of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Yes, that's entirely possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| But like with any of those sources of funds that are time-bound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| we always make sure that if we hire any employees or we enter into any contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| that those follow the parameters of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| That one and number 19, it's about $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Approving a contract in the amount of $2,748,764 with merit construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| for the construction of a new gymnasium at Carter Middle School, Resolution 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Carter Middle School is receiving out of the capital plan a new gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| I don't remember what we had in the original capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| but the bid came in to provide that gymnasium at $3,089,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1844)|
| 0:30:55| What we see here is the contract amount, which has, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| not been before school board, should be this evening, will be back before us next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1858)|
| 0:31:07| Could be this number, could be a different number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| But what I see that's before us right now is the contract has been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1872)|
| 0:31:22| Laundry equipment maybe has been deleted or detention ponds or scoreboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| Stainless steel countertops have been traded out with something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| There may have been a downgrade in flooring from something to number two or better, maple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| The driveways may be narrower or not as firmly constructed as originally anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| Some light poles have been deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| I guess my question of the school district revolves around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| were we building when we put out the bid to something which was above standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| and now we've fallen back to standard or was what was bid at standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| and now we're at less than standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| And then again, I guess I see us being caught between a rock and a hard place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| because the school board is going to talk about it this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| and we'll just have it passing through here Monday morning, Monday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1941)|
| 0:32:30| not knowing what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| So, Dr. McIntyre, you've heard my ramblings now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| Give me the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| So you are correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| This is an item that's before the school board this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| It's on your agenda because it was originally on the school board's August agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| and was deferred to tonight's special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| And it's on the agenda this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| The amount of the project, the cost of the project, is $2.74 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1980)|
| 0:33:09| And that is a bit lower than what the bid came in at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| And the bid came in, as you noted, a little bit higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| And there's been some work to really shave off some of the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| in order to bring it within the resources that we think are within reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| Just historically, as a reminder, this is a project that was proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| and approved by the school board more than two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| And it was actually the county commission that deferred action on it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| And there was a lot of conversation that ensued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| And in the meantime, obviously, the bidding environment has changed considerably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| with the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| And so it did come in at a cost that was a bit higher than anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| when we estimated the cost over two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| But I'll defer to Mr. Dillingham, who can talk you through the specific sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| decisions and propositions that have been made in order to bring the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| more closely in line with the resources that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| I believe that all of them are very reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| and keep us within the standards that we have for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| But I'll defer to Mr. Dillingham to give you the details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| Doug Dillingham, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| Commissioner McIntyre is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| What we have is still within our program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| Occasionally we have designers that are trying to do us favors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| and kind of upgrade finishes the quality of materials that we put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2079)|
| 0:34:48| And oftentimes after we go through the bidding process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| we end up having to knock those back to our current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| The deletions that are represented here are doing that for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| There are some items in here that were designed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| especially some of the site work items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| that in dealing with Mr. VandeVeid and his people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| we were able to determine a different method of achieving the same end product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| that saved us quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| So we actually had a civil engineer that was trying to do us favors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| and protect us through the bidding and construction process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| because that's what he's used to doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| not knowing that we have the expertise to deal with some of these things ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| So a lot of the money that has been deleted was from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| I understand that between the 2 mil 748 and the 3 mil 89,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2151)|
| 0:36:00| a detention facility or the water retention, light poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| or the grade work related to the driveway could have been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| A scoreboard, is it in or out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Typically we do not furnish scoreboards in construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| In the past, there have been agreements made with certain vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| that they would provide scoreboards if their products were used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| I'm unsure if that's still in place at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| but typically we do not furnish scoreboards in construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| In other words, whenever we go to the grand opening of the Southwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| it will not have a scoreboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Not unless someone has furnished it independent from the contract project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| And the grade of their floor, will it be number one maple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| As a matter of fact, they will have a composite floor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| Number two maple is our standard gymnasium flooring that we have put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| Will there be any laundry equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| What was the reason for the deletion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| We typically do not furnish laundry equipment either in any of the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| that's furnished either at the school level or by the school system itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| rather than running that through the general contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| which it doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| If you buy the laundry equipment through the general contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| then you're paying their overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| and profit on top of the cost of the laundry equipment to furnish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| And I saw that in restroom facilities and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| I agree with you on that particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| I just want to make sure that Carter Elementary, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Carter Middle is getting what is standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| and not being cut just because it was a $3 million bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| as opposed to an expected $2.7 million bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| It is getting what is standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| It will be comparable to the Powell Middle School gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I guess I'll talk on the other side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| I think the bid was supposed to be $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Am I correct in that on the capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| We estimated a cost of $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Actually, throughout this entire process, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| we had $5 million worth of additional appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| that we had requested for the entire Carter campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| $2.5 of that was taken and applied toward the Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| In actuality, the $5 million was an additional appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| that we were requesting because we already had money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| within our PPU budgets for a proposed re-roof at the elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| as well as asbestos abatement to the tune of about $321,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| So the way I looked at it is our total budget on the Carter project was $5.321 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| and we took $2.5 away from that, so that left $2.821 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| That's within the budget of appropriated money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| You know, I guess I struggled a little bit with that logic, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| it's apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| At one point you said $2.5 billion for Carter Gym,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| and now you're pulling money off of a roof of a building that's going to be torn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| and these other things, and I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| But, again, is that $600,000 or whatever that is left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| could that be better used somewhere else within the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| or somewhere else within Carter School campus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| I guess just to reallocate that money, again, my point is we're 10% over what we thought we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2374)|
| 0:39:44| for the Carter School gymnasium and site work, 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| And the way this whole thing was pitched to us is terrible economic conditions, the perfect storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2388)|
| 0:39:57| the contractors are hungry, they've sharpened their pencils to a razor edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| we're going to get some bids out of this whole process between elementary school and this gymnasium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| that's just going to knock our socks off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| And here we sit, I mean, 10% over that bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| You know, two years, I would dare say construction prices have not risen 10% industry-wide over this period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2416)|
| 0:40:28| And, you know, I struggle with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| We've got to put this in a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| We had a project, and I'm sure the school board will discuss this further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| so I'm just maybe giving some food for thought here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| And then it sounds like, I don't know what Commissioner Wright's initial desire was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| but it sounds like Carter is getting a little more than the Southwest Elementary in terms of the gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| So, you know, again, maybe they should, maybe the traffic pattern is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| But what I'm looking at is a bid that looks over to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| I know you've done a lot to pare things down from, it sounds like, the Cadillac that your civil guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| and your designers envision, but we're still 10% over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| And I just struggle with that from a construction standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| especially in this economic environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| So that's my thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Doug, in all these cuts and stuff that you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| and forget your superintendent standing right beside you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| but is there anything that you have heartburn with that you think really needs to stay in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| Are you happy with it as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| I am happy with it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Some of these things that I think we can do better if we do it on our own than the prices that we're given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2508)|
| 0:41:56| So, yeah, I'm happy with where we are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| I want to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| What's the scoreboard, what does it cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| It looks like it costs approximately $3,000, $3,500, somewhere in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| We will still have all the electrical there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| We will just do not provide the scoreboard itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| It's been asked of me that in your first game some past alumni basketball stars want to shoot the first basket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| That would be Bud Armstrong and Phil Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| So they'd like to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| That's just $1,600 a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Also, they want to participate in the slam dunk contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| I just want to make one quick comment in regards to what Commissioner McKenzie said a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| It has been two years, and it's not inconceivable that the cost of a lot of things have gone up 10 percent in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| When you get back in talking about construction two years ago versus now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| two years ago you could get it even cheaper than the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| But, you know, things are starting to build back now, so costs are higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| You know, we're still within the regional budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2597)|

| 0:43:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Mr. VandeVate called, and he is not able to appear here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| And Mr. Snowden, because of family issues, is not able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| But they will be here Monday should we have further questions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| It's not about this one particular project, but there are several, several road projects out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| and maybe we need to have an update on those different road projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| I'll make that note and ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| They will be here on Monday, and we'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| So the motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| The motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Just a comment and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| I know that Mr. Snowden's grandmother has been very ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| Did she pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| No, he's ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Mr. Snowden is sick, and so he was not able to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| And they both, you know, passed along their apologies for not being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| but they said they would be here on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Item number 13, approving three additional right-of-way acquisitions tracks 22 through 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2681)|

| 0:44:52| as outlined in the Urban Engineering Inc. plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| This is Resolution 402.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2698)|

| 0:45:05| And Cindy Buttry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| Ms. Buttry, we appreciate your being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| And if you'll give us your address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Cindy Buttry, 6404 Ridgewalk Lane, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| I'm actually here today in front of you all as the PTA president for Carnes Elementary School this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2724)|
| 0:45:32| So we have been working on this project for a number of years now, at least two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| And it is very important to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| I would just urge you guys to please approve this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| It's been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| I also have a letter, if you don't mind if I read, from the principal, Darlene Miller, at Carnes Elementary School as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Dear Knox County Commissioners, you have an important issue coming before you regarding a sidewalk project in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| I would respectfully ask that you give this matter very serious consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| A group of dedicated community volunteers have been working for two years to try to make our community a safer place for our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| who must walk to school and home from school each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| The project, which is intended to make the area safer, will also encourage families to get out and walk together in the evenings and on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2778)|
| 0:46:27| This particular area is a heavy traffic area due to the large number of homes and subdivisions in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| and the number of students who do walk to and from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| This is not an area that is serviced by a school bus due to the parent responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| We have children as young as seven who are walking down the shoulder of these busy roads, usually with an older elementary age sibling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| We do all we can to try to provide a safe situation as possible by holding the students who walk until the car traffic has cleared our school campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2811)|
| 0:47:01| But it is still a worrisome risk in having young children walking the shoulder of the narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| I hope you will consider the safety implications as well as the family and community enrichment these sidewalks can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| I would be happy to answer any questions you might have regarding this important community need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| Sincerely, Darlene Miller, Principal, Carnes Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| And we're also happy to, there's a group of us here from the school who, this is an important project for us and we just ask for your consideration in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2842)|
| 0:47:35| You can bring that, yeah, the clerk will want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| Also, Kelly Sharp has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2858)|
| 0:47:49| And we appreciate your being here. If you would give us your address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| Okay, it's 3316 Franklin Creek Lane, Knoxville, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| I actually live in one of the subdivisions that is along Beaver Ridge Road and I have three children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| Two at the elementary school and one at middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| And my oldest son is walking this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| So I come to you really as a concerned parent to please give us our sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| These kids, when they initially are walking home, they are going up a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| So there are cars that are going so fast and these kids have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| And then as they continue down, it actually drops off on one side of the road and it's just so unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| And these little kids are walking and the cars are not cautious at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| So I would really appreciate your support in helping these kids get home safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| Thank you. And Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Chief Marston, if you would come down here real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| Dwight and Jim Snowden have been working on this quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| Chief Marston, first of all, thank you for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| I think he wanted to speak to the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| But I wanted to, if you could, in your comments, aside from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| will you talk about kind of what Carnes has done since their membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| and their new focus and fundraising goal has come into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Yes, sir. I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Ken Marston, Carnes Fire Department, the Fire Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| First off, anything that we can do to assist in the donation of land and property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| to be able to pass this through, we'd love to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| As an emergency responder and somebody that responds to children that are injured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| anything we can do to make it safer for them to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| and from school, bike paths, sidewalks, and those types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| we are definitely in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| To speak to Mr. Anders, Commissioner Anders, about the membership program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| As all of you remember, a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Carnes Fire Department was in declining donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| and in trouble of being able to provide the type of service we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| We began our membership program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| 80% has been very well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| The Carnes Fire Department has added full-time, paid professional drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| that now respond with our apparatus and operate them for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| We have put on supervisory personnel and training officers to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| in training our volunteers as well as our paid staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| We have recently taken acquisition of a new Pierce Arrow XT fire engine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| at the cost of a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| That's the basic engine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| The outfitted completely, it's $795,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| That piece of equipment is state-of-the-art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| It has a compressed air foam system that uses one quarter of the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| to fight fire and knocks down fire in about 30% of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| that it takes normal water application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| It's lighter by 25% of the weight of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| Therefore, one person can handle a hose where we used to have two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| We're pretty excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| We've also broken ground and hope to complete a new station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| on the corner of Campbell Station Road and Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| which will be a permanent Hardin Valley station, staffed 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| cutting response times by 6 to 11 minutes to the Hardin Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| which we believe is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| As every minute counts, fire doubles about every 35 to 1 minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| so it cuts the amount of time we take to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| That station, again, will be state-of-the-art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| It's a $1.6 to $1.7 million station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| That station was funded through the membership program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| That station has a life expectancy of 60 years and is built for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| with a goal in mind of where Karnes and where the area will be in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| in the next 20, 30, or 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| So those are some of the things that we've been able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| with the new membership money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| Thank you, Chief. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| On the design of this sidewalk, I mean, everything is almost complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| The county has worked with each neighbor and each property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| to sign off on a design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| We're almost completely signed off on all of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| and so I would appreciate there's probably –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| I'd hate to guess how many houses are in all those subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| but there's probably – this sidewalk will affect 300 to 400 homes, I would assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| and that may be slightly large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| But this will run – enable the middle school kids to cross over Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| They can already cross over, but they'll be able to walk from the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| all the way to all the subdivisions and to the park, to the library, to the Ingalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| It will go from the Karnes Volunteer Fire Department all the way to the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| So this is a great project, and I would appreciate your all support on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Well, Ms. Sharp has convinced me, so I'll be voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| What's the cost on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| I've earned $31,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Please say, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| I've earned $31,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Two scoreboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| It was in the capital budget for this current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| I think it's $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| It's $531,229.92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3167)|

| 0:53:23| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| I would like to defer this to the same discussion about roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| and convenience centers until such time as we have Dwight VandeVate to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| So you want to go ahead and approve it or send it off without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3222)|

| 0:53:50| Item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Approving a memorandum of understanding in the amount of $397,546| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| between Knox County Health Department and Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| for the continuation of the in-school health program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| which provides school-based nursing services, school-based nutrition services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| and the family life education for FY 2012-13, Resolution 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| I sort of tied this to number seven, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| in that the tail end of both captions had that sort of same terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| family life education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Although this one may be significantly larger, this is money in the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| dollars going toward the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| And my question, thank you, ma'am, is the family life education, what's the need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3279)|
| 0:54:49| what are the goals, and how is it going to be measured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department, 140 Damron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| First of all, this is actually not health department money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| This is one of those confusing things that got set up years ago because of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| So this is excess fees that the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| and I always get the wrong office, to one of our offices to do services for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| That is set aside and can only be used for a health-related something in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| So it's excess fees, and we were made the fiduciary body, so we do the contract with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| But these are school employees, so this pays for five nurses, one nutritionist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| and the family life education position, which is a health educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| which was created after the issues with Planned Parenthood, if you all recall all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| So that's what this pays for, people to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| Did you want to address this, our finance director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| What she is saying, it's the trustee's commission on the amount that we collect on sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| for the town of Farragut and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| And, Ms. Buchanan, then continuing on, the curricula of this family life education is determined by the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| It is. This is a school's employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| It's determined by the state of Tennessee Department of Education has a family life curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| that is set in place for all schools across the state of Tennessee, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| And then the tail end of some of the attachments, medical supplies for immunization programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3388)|
| 0:56:37| They buy them, you pay for them, and it's just like, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| Because we have another issue that's before us somewhere about FluMist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| Yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| This is not for FluMist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| And, again, this is not health department money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| It's money that can't be used for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| So that's for day-to-day operations that the school nurses would be doing, giving vaccinations in the routine, their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3420)|
| 0:57:12| So, again, these are all school employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| You get to hold the billfold and they get to go purchase the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| They get to take care of the health of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| It's like at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| On page five, item number 21, approving a memorandum of understanding with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| for the construction of a trail at the city of Knoxville's expense within the Greenway corridor of Love's Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| to connect with Spring Place Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| This is resolution 701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Is there anyone here to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| Oh, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Commissioner Doug Battelle, Knox County Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| One end of this is like it's spring, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Or is that county park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| It's Spring Place Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| And the city has been looking at this for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| If you recall when the Wal-Mart was built there at Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| they actually built a section of Greenway Trail behind the Wal-Mart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| very similar to what we worked out with Wal-Mart on Ten Mile Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| So this is kind of one of many pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| The city is going to try to build to connect up with that trail system and then continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| At Millertown, there is a current project that may have been approved to two-lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| or change the two-lane to three-lane or something and widen the bridge across the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3522)|
| 0:58:49| Is there anything involved there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| That's the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Is the city trying to get the trail on that far as far as being north of the Wal-Mart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| Eventually, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| And I'm not too sure exactly what the plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| I can check on that and get back with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Really, here again, Mr. Chairman, is an issue that I'd like Dwight VandeVate to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3545)|
| 0:59:13| because Millertown crossing that creek is in the city somewhere along through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| and it may not be until we get up to the railroad tracks that we're in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| I view any road work through there, if it's not three-laned all the way through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| is still going to have a bottleneck just as though it is right now at the crystal on the little bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| So thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| And, Mr. Chairman, could we get that relayed to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| I'll be happy to relay that to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Item number 23 is a resolution designating, committing, and procuring funds for fiscal year 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3596)|
| 1:00:04| to fiscal year 2013 for various funds and departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Chris, if you would just kind of brief us on the number 23 and number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3609)|
| 1:00:18| Do we have a motion, first of all, on number 23?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| 23 is a process that we do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| The correct terminology now is to commit dollars from budget savings in FY12 or FY13 for various projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3630)|
| 1:00:41| And some of these will range from a clinic renovation of the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| We had an issue with not budgeting enough software licensing for IT, so that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| Some things for the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| Some things that we do have in there is the one that we talked about, which is the amount for the mayor's reading program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3658)|
| 1:01:08| That's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Our piece of the fund balance for schools is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| We're also going to put in there $500,000 to pay toward our closed DB plans, which is our retirement plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3676)|
| 1:01:24| because we need to work on paying more into those to get our risk down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| and we're going to discuss that some more, I know, in the retirement committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| And we've got things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| Two of our departments want to purchase some credit card software and machines, so we put that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| and the retrial expenses in there that we discussed during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| And we also have some money in there for a fuel contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| And then we have things in there for engineering and public works that we have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| which is they want to purchase a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| And things that we have to do is we have this subdivision bond foreclosure account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| and we have to reserve that every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| I'll answer any type of questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| Any questions for Chris on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| Chris, did you say a retrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Define that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Retrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| Christian Newsome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| We know that's coming up, so we want to try to set some savings aside for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| I will say this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| This is part of the process where we're not completely sure what our total amount of surplus is we're going to have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3753)|
| 1:02:45| We have a pretty good idea, and so much so that we think about $5 million we can commit and put over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3765)|
| 1:02:53| And there could be possibly some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| So I know during the budget process we talked about things to add to this or not add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3775)|
| 1:03:03| If there's a time to do it, I would say you do it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| because you don't want to wait until this process is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| and then we're into the next fiscal year and you want to go ahead and take from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| We'd rather go ahead and do it during the commitment process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| than wait and take it out of fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| because the bonding with the bond rating agencies look unfavorable on you if you take it out of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| They would prefer you do it during this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| When you say now, what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Within the next month, within the next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Yeah, I would say either this month or we could wait as late as next month to do some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3821)|
| 1:03:49| The problem that we run into is our auditors are here today and they're starting the process of closing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| And they're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| They'll be with us until November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| But we try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| We have to have our part closed out by the middle to the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| And so if you're not going to do it this month, if you want to wait and see where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| because I know I'm coming to the chairman's luncheon on Monday and I'll have more numbers then as far as where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| I know that you're interested in Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| And so if there's, I mean, if you're not going to do it now, if you're not going to add something to this list now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| you need to add it in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Chris, you mentioned, I'm sure we will talk about this at pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| but contribution to the two closed accounts or just one, just DB or DBN teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| Ours would be just the DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| I've had some conversations with Ron McPherson at schools about paying some on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| And they will bring their designation slash commitments next month, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| It's up to Dr. McIntyre and the schools to see what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| I just felt that it was the prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| If we have the ability to pay more, then we should pay more because we know that our return on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3911)|
| 1:05:22| on that account hasn't been what we want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| And we're paying into it now to the tune of about a million dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| And so we can get to start to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| And I think, not to get ahead, but I think at our next retirement board meeting, which will be Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| Bob Cross will talk to you and Chairman Hammond and Commissioner Norman about a process that we're talking about doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| about lowering our risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| It would be a process to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| It means that we, as a county, have to pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| But it takes our risk down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| I won't steal a thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Traditionally, that's the responsible thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| But this one, this item was just DB, closed DB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| And the teachers, technically, that throw, I mean, the Knox County taxpayer picks up the tab here or there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| But that flows through the school board's budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| And I would also say that the schools do pick up a part of our closed DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| And so it's just our portion of the DB plan that we're talking about with the $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| I appreciate your attention on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| And what was the last item, a subdivision bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| I would rather for White to explain it because he does a much better job than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| But it's simply put as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| As a subdivision may go into foreclosure, those bonds are picked up by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| And they'll hold on to those bonds until they go back and try to develop that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| And there's a lot of storm water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| And they use that money to go back in and do those subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| So we never really have any benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| We hold it, and then when they redo it, then we pay it right back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Then we'll move on to item number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| A resolution approving and authorizing the acceptance of funds from various sources in the FY2011-2012 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4048)|
| 1:07:37| for the furtherance of certain programs, resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Would you explain this one as well, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| What this is, and you're going to start seeing this probably once a quarter from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| this is legal restriction dollars that we receive every month, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| It can be from the Sheriff's Department Explorer Post Program to the farmer's market to inmate interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| And we get this money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| And it can only be spent for the purpose that it's taken in for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| So we have to estimate and appropriate those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| And then every year we'll reserve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| So we want to be more transparent and just let the commission approve these every quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| so you all will see what is coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| And it's just kind of a process of transparency that we're going to start doing every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| This is just to get everything that was in FY2012, and then you'll see it starting each quarter in FY2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4109)|
| 1:08:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| I really appreciate the thoroughness with which Chris has looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| because there's one entry in there for 33 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| I can't take the credit for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4134)|

| 1:09:21| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| And if you would explain to or let me just, are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| I wanted to put these out for questions in case anyone had questions because it does involve our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| I don't have something to say on 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| So if there's no question on the medical insurance benefits, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4174)|

| 1:10:31| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| I'd like to take a quick moment to thank the Insurance Committee for what they've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| They've been working real hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| I see Tim Wheeler sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| And is Nick here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| And, of course, what all they've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| And Hugh Holt and all his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| But I was real impressed sitting on that committee with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| And there's significant savings also, I mean, for the year, a couple hundred thousand dollars, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4250)|

| 1:11:03| Commissioner Burrell has contacted me and said that she would not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| So I'm going to ask that we send this on without recommendation, but hear any constituents that may want to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| So do we have a motion we send it on without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4275)|

| 1:11:17| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| I have a constituent who would like to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| Will you give us your name and address of the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Jolie, do you have those packets that I prepared for Commissioner Burrell and could you distribute them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| Jolie will be distributing at some time in the convenient near future to you a packet that I prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| and was distributed at this morning's Election Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| My name is Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| I live at 1714 North Hills Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| And at the start of this year, I could say that I voted at Bell Morris Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| a place that has been a good and convenient voting location for more than six decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| But the Election Commission has changed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| And if you missed the fireworks this morning, boy, you missed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| Let me just outline my perspective on the items of CLASH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| And even if you don't agree with me on the conclusion, I hope there's a few things you will agree with me on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| The items of CLASH, first, this packet that you're going to get includes the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| We put together an online petition against this closure of Bell Morris Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| And I checked it just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| It is now up to 177 names, almost all of them from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| and probably the majority from 37917 affected area code zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| These residents are upset, and here are some of the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| The lack of community involvement and decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| This is the closure of a major long-term voting location without any notification of neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| listservs, officials in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| It was just done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| Access was proposed as the reason why this was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| But there are greater access issues at Pond Gap, Carnes, Bluegrass, Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| and none of them were subject to the treatment that Bell Morris Elementary was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| As a matter of fact, I traced this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| It was one passed along phone complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| They got the name of the voter wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| I looked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| I figured out who it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| And he didn't want the precinct closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| He just wanted to raise an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| There's a distance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| I said, well, it's only a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| And I found four additional pairs of polling places that are closer together in the distance from Bell Morris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| to the merged location at Larry Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| I believe there's going to be on November a real problem with parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| because we're going to triple the number of voters at a location that is small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| It's a nice building, but it's small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| And it just will not be able to hold the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| And, of course, I said because these reasons do not appear to be valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| that people will begin to have suspicions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| Why, preceding a November election, in an open seat, a hotly contested Tennessee House open seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| do you close down the home precinct of one of the candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| That looks suspicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| It doesn't pass the smell test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| And that's where everybody got all huffy and said, no, Mark, it's not partisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| And then they voted three-two along partisan lines to keep things the way they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| So even if you don't agree with every conclusion, every comment I've reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| I hope you will agree with me that the Election Commission has a long way to go in its processes and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| It cannot just have vague recollections of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| It must have a formal procedure of collecting complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| and be able to trace them back and understand the true nature of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| And it should reinstitute policies of community notification before the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| The fig leaf put over this today was that there will be a meeting sometime in 2013 to talk about the community's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4477)|
| 1:14:46| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| But that should have occurred before the bad distillation, after the bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| We have a lot of voting precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| I understand that change is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| But the change that occurred here was unjustified and now has created needless division and quite a bit of upset people in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4497)|
| 1:15:07| I hope and pray that the prediction does not come true, that we don't have parking problems and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| But we are jamming a small voting precinct with a voting precinct twice its size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| We're going to create triple the flow in this small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| And for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| An excuse that doesn't hold up to close inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| The election commission blew this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| And they're covering their tracks with nice words today, when they weren't getting angry with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| You guys know that feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| It just doesn't hold up to close inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| It doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| And it was not done without community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| This was a bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| And I hope when the time comes for you to vote on it in a week that you will say, just as a symbolic gesture, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| It doesn't matter, party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| It doesn't matter what happened at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| It wasn't done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| You guys should do better and pass that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Does anyone else want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| I want to see if any other member of the public want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| If not, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| I guess I just, you know, I just encourage each commissioner just to we're not going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| hopefully this passes, but it won't make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| But I would encourage you all to drive to both places and just kind of lay eyes on it for yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| and make your own conclusion on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| There are several things that need to be done in all of our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| We all have those kind of screwy precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| Maybe the school's not there anymore, but they haven't closed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| So, you know, there is work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| I know when Greg McKay was there, we talked a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| I've talked with the present folks to a lesser degree about some things in my district that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| kind of need some housekeeping in terms of cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| But this one shouldn't have been on the first tier, I guess is my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| There's a lot lower hanging fruit out there as far as what we can do to kind of clean up the way our districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4631)|
| 1:17:19| are both numbered and located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| So, again, I just encourage you all to just drive to both places and come up with a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| between now and Monday and kind of come up with your own thoughts about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| You know, I don't know too much about this except for what I read in the paper on the article on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| But the other thing I'd question is whether we have any authority to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| And I'd like to address that to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| Can we override the election commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| Do we change what they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| You can certainly show your concern, but that's within the purview of their authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| And, again, this may be, if it's not true what was written, I'd ask Professor Harmon that he can correct me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4678)|
| 1:18:08| But when they had the meeting on this is that there's two Democratic representatives and three Republicans that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| that are on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| One Democrat didn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| And the other Democrat seconded the motion to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| And I just, you know, I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| I mean, it's implied that this was some sort of partisan decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| But when the Democrat recommended or seconded the motion to close it, it doesn't sound partisan to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Let me address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Yes, this was scheduled against the court date for Dennis Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| Cassandra McGee did second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| That was a 26-minute meeting in which the entire agenda got done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| Don't you guys wish you guys could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| I remember the eight-hour meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| It was rushed through rather quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| There was not the background work that should have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| And Cassandra McGee today, she couldn't be anything more than gracious about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| and has reconsidered and actually seconded the motion today to reopen Bill Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| And if you want to talk about partisanship, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| I'd rather just talk about the merits of the lack of merits of the reasons given for the closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| But this particular precinct, Bill Morris, is 20 percentage points greater to Democrats than the county average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4756)|
| 1:19:25| The one that's being merged with, Larry Cox, 10 percentage points more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| So you're taking two Democratic-leaning districts, merging them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| and tripling the number of voters in a small location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| And this area has a record of giving votes to local Democratic candidates, me, Commissioner Broyles, Harry Tindall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4776)|
| 1:19:44| and yet you're taking the home precinct of a very likely to be successful Democratic candidate, Gloria Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| and you're forcing it into a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| People get very attached to voting locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| They like to vote on Election Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| And doing this could depress voting and make voting, at least it makes voting more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| And that's why I led this charge against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Mr. Chairman, have you checked with the Election Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Are they going to be here to answer questions on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| They knew about the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| They knew it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| What about Monday, next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| On Monday, we can ask that they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| If you'd like, I can ask them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Because I'm like Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| I'll ask them to come to the Chairman's lunch, if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| I mean, they can come here, too, at our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Yeah, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Chairman lunch probably makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| I'll ask them to come to our lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| I'd like to agree with Commissioner McKenzie on one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4837)|
| 1:20:45| We're just seeing history made here, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| There is more lower-hanging fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| I've got one polling place that doesn't have a permanent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| Every time we have an election, we have a different place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| and it's like a scavenger hunt to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| So, you know, we've got some problems in other places, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| You know what I'd like to do, just since we don't have all the input here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| is just to make a, you know, we really don't have all the information we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we just defer this completely until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| Yeah, the motion was to send it on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| No, that's okay because Commissioner Burwell has asked that we do that since she couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| So the motion is to send on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Item number 31 is a resolution withholding disbursements to Knoxville Area Chamber Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| and to request financial disclosures are provided to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| Resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Just wanted to say a couple of things about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| One, in discussion with the law department, this is a legally responsible request on several levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4920)|
| 1:22:09| and we can talk about this, and I hope we will discuss it thoroughly on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4929)|
| 1:22:20| And it wouldn't be, I wouldn't be averse to some other motion or reconsideration of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4940)|
| 1:22:28| deferring it until Monday would be fine with me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| But the other sort of an aside to it, and as we get into the legal validity of the request, I guess then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4951)|
| 1:22:44| the other thing that sort of flew at me was the letter was sent to Mr. Edwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| and Mr. Edwards has yet to respond to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| A commissioner on this body, an elected official of this county, he chose to respond via the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4976)|
| 1:23:04| And so that's somewhat of a disturbing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| I think it's an improper way to address the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| and it's obviously the way that Mr. Edwards thinks it should be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=4994)|
| 1:23:22| So we'll take this up on Monday, and if you wish to support it now, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5002)|
| 1:23:30| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| So do you want to have a substitute motion that we send it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| I think in retrospect, I would prefer to have it sent on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| I withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| So you're making then the motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| I'd like to make the motion to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| You want to address us on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| I did just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Jennifer Evans with the Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| We did respond to you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| I'm sorry you haven't received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| We sent it to the commission office along with the letter and our last audit, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| So we'll have to check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| We haven't received it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| The commission office received anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| We can send it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| We sent it probably a week and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| So I just want you to know that we did respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| It was sent to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| So we'll send it again, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| How about sending it to the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| Can we send a soft copy then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| An e-mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Can you send it to each of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| I think we, you know, when we discussed talking about contracts and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| last month we voted 9-2 to approve their contract with the Chamber, with the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| and with Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| And, you know, I understand and I think that everything, the process should be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| I understand Commissioner Norman's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| But when we're dealing with private companies, this is a contract for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| And when we're dealing with anybody under this interpretation of the law or under this interpretation of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5104)|
| 1:25:13| when we're dealing with, and I'll use IJ as their provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| PILOT's a provider, through contract with the county, we're asking for their private side dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5119)|
| 1:25:26| And I think it sets a dangerous precedent if we're going to ask, and I understand this is a chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| this is an economic development function, this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| but if we're going to sit and ask for the private side of this organization's dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| then we're opening up to setting aside and saying, okay, I want to see PILOT's private side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| I want to see IJ's private side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| Because they're receiving county money, they're providing a service, just like the Chamber is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| or just like, you know, whoever we give KTSC or their old contract, Rural Metro or AMR or Lifeguard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5152)|
| 1:26:05| Under this interpretation of the law, anybody that has a contract with the county and provides a service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| we get to see their private side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| And I don't think the investors or I don't think companies will want to do business with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| if that's our way of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| And so I think that that's something we need to be very careful with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| You know, I think the Chamber should be accountable for the dollars that we give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| But when they have a private membership, you know, I think it's a private membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Would this resolution prohibit the flow of taxpayer dollars to the Chamber if they did not show, say, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5194)|
| 1:26:49| who gave the $40,000 or $50,000 in May and June for the television ads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| Am I reading that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| That was pushing the $0.35 tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| Am I reading that right, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| I mean, I'm sort of in a fog on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| Restate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| You know, we all saw television ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| $30,000 or $40,000 was spent on television ads in favor of the $0.35 property tax increase in late May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5235)|
| 1:27:23| and early June, funded privately, we're told by the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| Would your resolution stop the flow of taxpayer dollars if they didn't be totally transparent about situations like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5248)|
| 1:27:39| Well, that's exactly what we're requesting is a statement about expenditures for those activities, those political activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5259)|
| 1:27:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| I mean, obviously it's apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| It's taxpayer money and it's wealthy, I would assume wealthy individuals who gave $5,000 and $10,000 to push their calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5271)|
| 1:27:59| in conjunction with the Chamber's calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| I just wanted to get clear for my own personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| I can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Jennifer Evans again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| We have provided a list of who actually, we were actually served, the PIF served as a pass-through for those specific videos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| and we've given a list of who paid for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| That's really the only expense we incurred in that whole school budget campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| So we have been transparent in any of the public dollars that are incurred as a result of the defined services contract that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5305)|
| 1:28:34| with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| We have shown quarterly expenses, and our doors are open for anyone to come look at receipts related to those specific expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| But as Commissioner Anders was saying, we're a private member-based organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| and so companies make contributions to the Chamber with the idea that it's going to be a private contribution and not a public domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5327)|
| 1:28:56| Jennifer, could you back up a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| Yeah, your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| So, again, we are a nonprofit, but we are a private member-based organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| and companies make contributions to the Chamber with the intent that it's going to be private and not in the public domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| And, again, it is a defined services contract, and so we are providing a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| And those services that are provided with public dollars are detailed out in a quarterly form to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5359)|
| 1:29:27| So we will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Tony had asked me to research some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| So I think there needs to be some clarification going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| Number one, federal law requires that they make public these documents, their tax returns, their 990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5379)|
| 1:29:49| Included in their 990 is their statement that they have to make known the donors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| So that argument, and they did, in fact, on one of their tax returns that was submitted to Mr. Rosenberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5394)|
| 1:30:02| they did show all of the donors for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| Their others have not had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| On the funds, the funds are totally commingled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| They're absolutely every dollar that you give to the Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| part of that dollar goes to everything such as salaries of the staff or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| It's commingled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| It's not segregated into separate funds, and it's not required to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| Secondly, if you will look at the audited financial statements that have been submitted so far, and it's not all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5427)|
| 1:30:34| there's an intertwining whereby Innovation Valley, the Chamber, this 501C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5434)|
| 1:30:43| money is passed back and forth amongst them included in the monies that we give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| And I think Mr. Norman has an absolute right as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| which allows any agent of county to go in and get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| It's transparent under federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| It's transparent under state law, which requires that the nonprofits designate everybody that gets over $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5462)|
| 1:31:11| whether they're an employee or a private contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| And going to Mr. Norman's request to Grant Rosenberg's office where these documents are not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| In my opinion, Mr. Norman has every right, as does every commissioner, to request these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| The only thing he received that I saw that he gave me was a one page with a couple of back pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5490)|
| 1:31:40| that just arbitrarily designated in each quarter one-fourth of a portion of the $80,000 to three different funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5500)|
| 1:31:52| that they claimed with no detail and no backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| And under their contract, they have to supply receipts and invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| None of that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| So what Mr. Norman has asked, in my opinion, my legal opinion based on the documents and the law, is not out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5521)|
| 1:32:09| It's what they have to provide, they being the Innovation Valley and the Chamber Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| what they have to supply to this body and the public as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| The public has an absolute right under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| That's why they get this nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| Federal government says, we won't tax you, but you are the fiduciary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| and the steward of these funds for the public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| And as a result, you've got to account for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| So the taxpayers, in my opinion, based on what Mr. Norman had asked me to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| by and through you have an absolute right to know how all of these dollars are spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| There can't be anything secret about private members or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Dave, go back to what you make sure I'm right in what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| You're saying that they can take the money that we give from Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| they put it into their pot, and they can use it for salaries or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| And our last, when we approved the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| one of the last things we had was Commissioner Andrews got them to approve some extra,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| I forgot, Brad, how much money was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| It wasn't that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| It was the current last year's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| It just kept the funds the same from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| And Rhonda Rice came to the podium and I specifically asked her, is this going to be used for salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| And she said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| I just want to remind this commission of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| We can provide receipts for all of those expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| We've always said in the contract it's written that we will provide receipts specifically for all the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| Mr. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| Your question was, is any of it going to salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| We have a contract that lists the number of the types of services that we are under contract to provide to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5628)|
| 1:34:00| We can show you and have shown you receipts of where we have spent that much money doing those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5640)|
| 1:34:09| How money is intermixed in a 501c6 is neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5649)|
| 1:34:20| Monday we're going to have our attorney here and attorneys can talk to attorneys and we will, that can be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5660)|
| 1:34:27| But as far as saying that we are intermingling staff, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5667)|
| 1:34:35| We can show you receipts of where we have said we would do so much marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| and then we have spent so much money in the marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| That's what she said was going to spend on marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| And we can show you receipts in that amount and actually more because, remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| you're leveraging your dollars with a whole lot of other dollars to get a bigger bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| You're basically about six percent of the chamber's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| You know, this is an interesting conversation, a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5706)|
| 1:35:13| And it's one that I've been having a lot with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| So I guess I'll have that conversation with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| You know, I'm not going to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| But with that said, just like we had a conversation with TVA, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| had several difficult conversations with Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| And now I'm having it with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| This is a new day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| This is a different kind of way of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| We can't do the same way we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| I don't agree with all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| I think our Deputy Law Director has brought some very valid and interesting things forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5749)|
| 1:35:57| I mean, you know, this day of talk radio and instant stuff being out there holds us all to a greater accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5757)|
| 1:36:07| You know, TVA is going to win every time they cut a tree down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| They're going to win in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| But, you know, the court of public opinion, you're going to, you know, they're going to take their licks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| And they've been taking them there at their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| I'll say the same thing to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| You all can be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| And, again, I'm going to support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| But you all, you know, this is the nature of life as we all know it going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| I hate that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| I wish we could, you know, I understand in business some things, you know, it's like the sausage factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| I understand that clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| And, you know, everything's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| But, you know, everything's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| And explaining complicated things in the public can be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| Believe me, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Again, that's why I'm not going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| And I know that you guys are spending the money appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| But you're going to be asking questions that you all don't think are fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| And it might be perfectly legal to have to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| So this is just like I told the folks in TVA, you know, I know they're, you know, in their case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| they're a pretty big player in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| But, you know, they can get themselves in a world of hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| So I would hope that we could move beyond these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| But, you know, I will say it's going to be a two-person process, a two-party process, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| to get us beyond these monthly conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| Let me just say that, to be perfectly clear on where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5858)|
| 1:37:46| the chamber understands fully and would not have it any other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| than to have full disclosure of every public dollar that we receive, how it is spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5873)|
| 1:38:02| what the outcomes are, every piece of what we have committed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| As far as disclosing private dollars and how private the membership piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5887)|
| 1:38:16| as though you're going to go through Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church and ask them for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| because they do a daycare center thing on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| It's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| Again, not to oversimplify your metaphor, but, yeah, TVA and KUB is going to catch grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5908)|
| 1:38:38| But if they don't cut the trees, we're going to have power outages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| They've got to go out there, they've got to cut those trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| and then they're going to have to take the heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| And we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| I just would like to say that fundamentally I think this thing boils down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| as it's been expressed by Mr. Boock to me, that it's the public's right to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5939)|
| 1:39:07| It's the taxpayer's right to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| And when we boil all of these responsibilities that a nonprofit has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| and this is a nonprofit acting with the supplement of taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5957)|
| 1:39:24| and what Mr. Boock and our law department will be able to show Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| probably very succinctly, is that according to our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| according to their past contract, and according to IRS rules, they have to show this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| They've got to show clearly what those expenditures were for these political activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| They can call them whatever they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| and they come up with some euphemism about an issue, something or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| I can't remember what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| But anyway, these are political activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| and they are now another issue is that they see in retrospect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| that this is a troublesome area that they've entered into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| and so now they're going to form a political action committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| to help themselves in an accounting role to separate these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| So it's almost like they've condemned themselves by now retracing and going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| But we're acting under a motion of no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6026)|
| 1:40:33| so this is all going to come up again on Monday, so I hope we can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Mr. Edwards, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| I agree with Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| This needs to be vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Apparently there are legal issues that are being, and I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| Actually, Jennifer is not a practicing attorney, but she doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| Here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| As what Commissioner Norman has just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| there is not a chamber in the western hemisphere that doesn't, one, do advocacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6063)|
| 1:41:13| Now, that sounds a lot to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| Somebody wants to use political in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| But issue advocacy is something that every chamber does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| Most chambers, certainly most regional chambers, do economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6085)|
| 1:41:32| And of those, they do receive public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| This is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| It has a lot to do with something, but it isn't propriety of what a chamber does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6099)|
| 1:41:46| Motion on the floor is to send on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| It is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Item number 33 is a resolution requesting that the chairman of the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| forward a letter to the Knox County Legislative Delegation requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| that the delegation enact legislation designed to broaden the eligibility criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| under the Tennessee Property Tax Freeze Act, Resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| Moved to be sent on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| On page seven, item number 34,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| Resolution requesting that Knox County Purchasing Division issue a request for information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| or other appropriate requests for vendors qualified to conduct a comprehensive survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| on behalf of Knox County's public school teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| This is Resolution 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| I'm going to ask that this be sent without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| The schools are going to be addressing this at their special call meeting this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| and then I'm going to address it with the schools present at the chairman's lunch on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| So if I could get a motion to send this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| I would like to say one thing about this before Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| and that is that there are people in the community who are very interested in a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6185)|
| 1:43:14| that is possibly designed as free from attachments to the political entities as they could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6194)|
| 1:43:23| And so there's efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| I know there's efforts out there to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| I know the school board, when they look at the commission being taken a lead role in some type of survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6210)|
| 1:43:39| there probably is quite a bit of trepidation over that pact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6219)|
| 1:43:47| And I know on my side, looking at a survey that was promoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| or initiated by the school board would equally have some conflicting motives in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6234)|
| 1:44:04| And so anyway, I just want the body to be aware that there are entities that are promoting a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6244)|
| 1:44:13| that are outside of our reach, both the commission's reach and the reach of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6253)|
| 1:44:22| And I think that it might be wise for us to just back out of the issue and see if that takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6262)|
| 1:44:33| And if it takes place and it's properly vetted and it accomplishes what a survey should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6273)|
| 1:44:42| which in my view I think the ideal survey would be a survey for me of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6282)|
| 1:44:53| It would be a survey designed by teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| It would be a survey that's made by teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| And then it is free of any connection to either political body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6298)|
| 1:45:06| So if that can be accomplished outside of us, I hope they can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| And I would be in favor of that technique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6311)|
| 1:45:18| I know Ms. Morgan's here, and I don't know whether she would like to speak to the issue, but she is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6318)|
| 1:45:26| And I'd like to call on her if she would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6326)|
| 1:45:37| Hi, I'm Sherry Morgan, president of the Knox County Education Association, 2411 Magnolia Avenue, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| which is our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| We have not taken a position on this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| We've just talked to some teachers throughout the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| By next Monday afternoon, we have a meeting, and I'm sure I'll hear from some teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| some concerns that teachers have told me so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| They want to make sure it's anonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| They want no demographics so teachers can't be traced back to them, especially the smaller elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| You may only have two teachers per grade level, and they have a fear of it being traced back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| They're concerned about the survey questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| We've all had surveys where the questions were worded in such a way that there's only one way you could answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| So they're concerned about the survey questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| and they want to know, is the survey really going to be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| Because a lot of times we do surveys, and the results aren't really used that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| So that's just concerns I've heard so far from some teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| And I think that I have in my head, because I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| and obviously I've talked to some people that are in the business of doing these types of surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| It is their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| That is their, and so there is a funding apparatus that's going to have to take place privately if it is not public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6409)|
| 1:46:58| So if it's not within our budgetary constraints and it's not within the school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| there's going to have to be private funding of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| But there is, there's an ability to do this anonymously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| And I think there are, without outlining what that is, in my discussions with representatives of the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6433)|
| 1:47:24| they have explained to me how it can be done absolutely anonymously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| That is, they get the home address of the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| They get sent to their home a query.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| And then they get information from the teacher sent back to the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| It never touches anybody within county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| And so as long as it stays there, anonymity is secure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| and then I think proper input from the teachers could be secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| And then, you know, ideally, the teachers, that input would go into the question-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| So that's sort of an outline in my discussion with one representative of one company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6484)|
| 1:48:12| So I feel like that might be a technique that we could work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| But, again, you know, teachers are going to have to review it and believe that it will work first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6497)|
| 1:48:25| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Yes, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| My question, I guess, would be, because my goal, I guess, in this survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6507)|
| 1:48:33| I like the idea of pulling away from both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| I guess everybody has an opinion of what the survey would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| And my desire for the survey would be to tell us what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| for teachers to be able to tell us what they're missing to deliver the education that they want to deliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6523)|
| 1:48:50| And how do we design that with everybody's, and I think your idea is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| how do we design that or how do we bring that forward to get everybody's opinion of their own goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| Because, you know, our goal is to pass a budget that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| How do we, without making it, I don't want to make it political either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| but how do we build a survey that does that without making it political?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Well, I think the method that is proposed by this person, this one business that does this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6555)|
| 1:49:25| is that teachers are solicited, first of all, for information about what they think is significant in terms of a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6565)|
| 1:49:37| Okay, so there will be, if just hypothetically 5,000 teachers are in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6577)|
| 1:49:48| and 5,000 teachers are sent out a questionnaire that asks them for all areas of concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6588)|
| 1:49:57| well, then that is accumulated by the company and analyzed for common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6597)|
| 1:50:10| And then survey questions are developed from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| So, essentially, the teachers are the ones who give the survey questions that they think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| and based on their frequency and so on, that's how the survey is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6619)|
| 1:50:27| So the teachers develop the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| But they don't sit around in a committee and develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| It's not a committee effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| It's based on a total mailing and then accumulation of information from the mailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| I think it's a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| I have done a number of these surveys over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| and there is not a legitimate company out there that is going to let anybody control their survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| because their reputation is on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| So the whole notion that somebody is going to control the survey, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| if you hire a company that's not reputable, then that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| But if you're going to bring in a reputable company that does this type of activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| nobody is going to control the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| I have no problem at all with us funding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| I do have a real problem with me or anybody on this body or the schools or the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| or the teachers being the sole people who bring forth the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| A good company is going to talk to teachers and probably survey commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| and survey the school board and survey the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| and they're going to take all that data and come in and put together a questionnaire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| and they're going to send out that questionnaire and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| Is this what you are looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| Is this going to get the desired outcomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Then they're going to put it in the field, and then they're going to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| and they're going to get the data, and they're going to present the data to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Now, a reputable company is not going to allow that data to be skewed or biased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| or in any way tainted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| And so that's what I'm looking for is a company that is reputable, that has done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| that has the reputation of being credible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| and is not going to allow anybody to come in and taint it one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| I do not see this as a witch hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| I do not see this as a means of hammering anybody or slamming anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| I see this as a way for us to improve our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| And if that is the desired outcome, I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| But if it's going to be some way for an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| whether it be a commission or a school board or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| to try to get desired outcomes, then we're wasting our money and we're wasting our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| But I think this survey can be a valuable tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| I think it can be a valuable resource for us as we move forward with education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| to talk with our teachers and ask them, What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| And let's not be afraid of the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| But the key is the company, the reputable company that is hired to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| And if we get the right company, all of these things are going to be taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| and it's going to be done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| I totally agree, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| And I'd remind the body that there is a distinct fear that supervisory staff will somehow for a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6772)|
| 1:53:13| I mean, when you're a teacher, you have a fear that your job is in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6793)|
| 1:53:21| I think this is true for a large number of people in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| that frank discussion or opposition to strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6805)|
| 1:53:32| and especially the way things are going now, the rapid changes that are taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| you will not get a frank discussion or criticisms, critical comments of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6817)|
| 1:53:47| unless you have a survey such as we're describing right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| It just will not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| And so it's useless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| It's a useless activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| It's a total waste of time unless we can proceed as you said, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6837)|
| 1:54:03| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| I need to step back for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| I have a question of Commissioner Norman talking of someone being able to provide the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6849)|
| 1:54:17| in such a way that anonymity be guaranteed if something's mailed to a specific address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6857)|
| 1:54:25| and there's a response from that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| And this is my question is actually going to the law director for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| Even though this organization doing the survey may be contracted by Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| or the school board or the school board paid for by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| it doesn't matter to me how the questions are presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6886)|
| 1:54:56| The company providing the survey, would they be able to maintain the anonymity working for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6896)|
| 1:55:04| the public entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| In other words, does the work of this outside firm become public knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| because they're working for the body politic or the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| Yes, Chairman and members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| Obviously, as I've mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| it's quite simple in terms of the technical aspects of assuring a participant anonymity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6927)|
| 1:55:34| But whether or not that jives with the Tennessee Open Records Act is another story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| And what the State Open Records Council, which is a final arbiter in Nashville, has said is that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6939)|
| 1:55:47| a survey can be confidential provided that, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6947)|
| 1:55:54| it is done in such a manner that the participant gives no identifying information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6954)|
| 1:56:01| and, two, that it's done in such a manner, again, that provides that kind of anonymity, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6961)|
| 1:56:13| So, in other words, I know oftentimes people will try to skirt the public records law by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6973)|
| 1:56:21| well, we didn't do that, a private entity did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| But ultimately, if you're going to use the data, then you've started getting into that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| So the key really is, I don't know if the scenario that Commissioner Norman suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| that they contact people at home because if they start developing that database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| someone could say they're an agent of the government and, as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| I want access to the identifying information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| Yeah, and it's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| But I think there are ways to do it in such a manner that it still passes legal muster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| This is according to State Open Records Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| I just, in terms of the technical aspects, you'd have to do a request for qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| because it's a professional service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| And then, looking at the various scenarios, your safest bet is to have Bud Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| because I imagine this will be in the future, and or David Buch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| confer with Open Records Council and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| these are the entities that have responded to our request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| Which of these scenarios do you feel would comply with the open records law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| Let me say, let me back up for just a second and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| I base the question on the hotline that we have here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7044)|
| 1:57:29| Even though it's provided by an outside organization, their records are public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7049)|
| 1:57:37| As it comes to us, that turns into public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| It does once the matter has been concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7065)|
| 1:57:46| So, technically, when it's an open file, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| It's protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| But, again, that's a statutory exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| This is something a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| This will be a closed survey at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| Yeah, I think once you start actually identifying people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| you're going to have a little trouble saying that it's privileged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| that someone can't access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| But, again, there's going to be a myriad of opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| and a myriad of scenarios you can follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| one or two of which should comply with the public records law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| It just has to be artful and it has to be legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| I was, you know, I think he's left the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| but this is the perfect opportunity for the Chamber to fund something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| This may be in the too hard pile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| I agree with Commissioner Wright, and he stole a lot of my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| But my other question is, if we use, I guess to Commissioner Norman's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7125)|
| 1:58:54| if we use county schools' e-mail addresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| the new Sentinel can go and do a Freedom of Information Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| and get every last bit of it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| So, you know, do we, if that's our goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7142)|
| 1:59:10| and we may need to redefine the goal, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| I mean, the whole notion of an anonymous survey within a public entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7154)|
| 1:59:23| like school board, school business, might be too, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| it might be on that too hard pile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| So I would just hate for us to say, okay, you know, Mrs. So-and-so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7169)|
| 1:59:36| Mr. So-and-so teacher, you can be open and honest with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| and then six months down the road, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| we're going to have to make those records public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| So I'm glad we're having this conversation now and not afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| But hopefully, I see Mr. Oaks is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| hopefully the school board will also think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| and hash over some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| I think this is a great dialogue because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| I'd rather have these discussions now than after a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| and we're having to apologize to people because their name is being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| put in places that they never anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| So the motion is to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| Item number 36, resolution to provide for education incentive payments in an amount up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7221)|
| 2:00:28| but not in excess of $1,000 to county official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| and full-time employees of Knox County Government as an education incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| for the attainment and maintenance of the designation of certified public administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| This is resolution 912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| If I might explain why I've put this on before we get a motion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7246)|
| 2:00:52| I had a meeting with Mr. Ballard and Ms. Witt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| and they were explaining to me that they have employees that are coming to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| and to other office holders who are asking the status of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| They are in the process of trying to take their number of hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| and they were just asking, you know, is there going to be funding available for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| What is the funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| Because they obviously have heard all of the discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| And so they said that they were looking to commission for guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| so that they would know how to proceed as we're going into the next budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| So I told them I would be happy to put this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| The $3,000 seemed to be a bit excessive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| and so the notion of up to $1,000 was something that I told them we would bring here for discussion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7292)|
| 2:01:41| So with that, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| I'll make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| We'll just talk about it Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| I've got, you know, there's an ongoing investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| I just want to remind the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| I want to speak on that, and we'll talk about that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7323)|
| 2:02:04| Yes, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| Just quickly, define, you say full-time employees of Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| and prior to that, county officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Are we county officials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| Define county officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| But it says county officials and full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| Does that mean county official who is full-time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| Or just county officials over here and full-time also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| Let me defer to Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| Mr. Ballard, do you want to explain this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| Well, I don't know how well that I can explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7350)|
| 2:02:33| Let me take some of the heat off of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| The bottom line is the way this code reads, the Tennessee Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| you're talking about elected officials like Mr. Ballard, like Ms. Witt, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| so that are full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| They could be fee officers, constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| That's what the program was designed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| to enhance their professionalism through the acquisition of the certified public manager program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| The state will provide a stipend to those elected officials who complete the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| and allow counties the option to likewise provide a stipend for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| So let's say Mark Jones, who is your HR director, decides, I want to pursue this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| The state won't give him a stipend, but it does permit you by law to give him a stipend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| Phil, if you want to add to that, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| No, I think you did it quite well, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| What had happened is that a lot of employees in Ms. Witt's office and mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7406)|
| 2:03:33| was concerned whether this program was going to continue or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| And the way that I look at it, I was not, of course, being in the private sector, exposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| But then we did have a couple of people that has taken the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| And what I see is the educational program administered by CSTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| and that appears to be statutory in origin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| There's TCA code there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| And you get a certified public administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| And the way that I understand it, and the numbers might be a little bit wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| because it didn't look when I come down, but it's 120 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| Then I think you have to pass a test at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| And then there's some off-site work that you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| And then you have to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| And then you have some educational requirements to continue in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| And there's a history to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| And, you know, we've sort of lost a little bit of the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| because it predates back to Lillian Bean, Martha Phillips, some of their deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| And when you get to asking questions, you know, it's getting a little dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| Commissioner McKenzie says it's a new day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| But we do know from just looking at Channel 6 News report last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| that they reported that some offices got $3,000, some $1,777,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| or maybe not got paid, and then paid $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| So there's certainly, you know, no uniformity in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| I might even add that even with term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| you're going to have different officers that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| And you have long-term and career employees, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| that maybe with each commissioner or with each office holder would have a different view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| I'd point out that we have a uniform policy if you drive a Knox County vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| And this is encouraged by CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| It's longstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| And it probably needs another look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| One of the things on the compromise, I'm sort of speaking for the employees in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7531)|
| 2:05:37| because they don't want to see it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| They've invested a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| Some of these people have been in it for more than 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| And if you think about, I don't know that the $1,000, how that was actually arrived at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| but if you look at that dollar amount versus $3,700 or $1,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| and you reduce that to $1,000, that's definitely a compromise across the board of either it's going to exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7559)|
| 2:06:07| or it's not going to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| But that's going to lower the budget sum in and of itself if you accept this resolution without modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7569)|
| 2:06:17| or even if you want it to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| And, you know, a lot of things change when you say continuing education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| Things that happened in government, I think, a long time ago are not the same today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7584)|
| 2:06:31| So the continuing education, some of the things that you hear out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| part of the reason that they did it, the deputies and stuff and the office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| they learned a little bit more about the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| So there's lots of things to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| And I would like to point out also for the employees, a lot of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| this has not been questioned until this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7610)|
| 2:06:54| And they have received this, and that was the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| Many of the office holders was in there for more than one term, seven, five, and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| And this has become part of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| And it's just like you, you know, if you take $3,000, that could be 10% of somebody's income, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| And you all plan a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| The county plans a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| So I think it's right that we reach some sort of resolution about it that they can plan a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7638)|
| 2:07:23| Are you going to ask them to take a 10% cut in pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| Is this an entitlement program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| You know, there's a whole bunch of theories out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| But, you know, we really don't know the basis of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| But, again, we're re-looking a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| The Charter Committee, Review Committee, they're looking at a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| So maybe it's time to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| But I think a decision needs to be reached, one, on uniformity, just like we have with other Knox County programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7665)|
| 2:07:52| And, number two, the employees, 20 years is sure putting in a lot of education time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7672)|
| 2:07:59| And if it's going to be done away with and we can't reach an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| then they need to know so that they can establish their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| and maybe they want to go out and make other income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| So I think this is a very important decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| I think it's like oil and water in regards to Larry there with great respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7693)|
| 2:08:21| Investigation has nothing to do with a longstanding program and how it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7701)|
| 2:08:28| You know, we learned a long time ago that we don't have investigative powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| We don't know how long an investigation is going to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| And this needs to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| I think if you all received the two documents here, this was copied off the CTAS webpage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| and it is about the full-time officials and it's also about the full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7724)|
| 2:08:50| And, you know, it's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| If you look down to a little bit below the center of the page for full-time employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| it's got a blank for the Knox County Legislative Body to fill in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| It says full-time officials, county commissioners, and full-time paid employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| I'm guessing that's a sample resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| But this did have, was given life by the commission many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| and it seems like anything that we do with it as we go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| should be determined by the commission at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| I guess the office holders really could handle it as a budget standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| But like there again, I think it should be uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| If you do take it, one shouldn't receive double the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| The thousand dollars can be arbitrary to any amount that you all see fit going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| That's all that I have to add with great respect to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| Chris, did you want to address this before we have other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7782)|
| 2:09:50| I would agree with Mr. Ballard that uniformity would be a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| What I would caution on is simply this, is if you said yes to this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7796)|
| 2:10:05| and I'm going to use Dr. Buchanan for an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| and then half the employees in her health department said, I want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| How do you say, I mean, who do you determine who can do it and who cannot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7813)|
| 2:10:18| And then the other issue is going to be our budget issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| That's not been budgeted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| And so if you did it going forward for FY13, there would be a budget issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7824)|
| 2:10:31| And then how would you budget for it in the future would be an issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7831)|
| 2:10:35| Is it a one-time payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| Or is it an ongoing payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| It's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| And, I mean, it's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| I agree that there needs to be some uniformity because what you have now is you have some who's paying $3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7847)|
| 2:10:55| some paying one or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| And so that is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| But then how do you say who can take it and who cannot take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| And where's the cutoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| And, you know, how do we pay for it in the long run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| Chris, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| Chris, you had come to me at one time, and you and I were talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| and just what you're talking about, Martha's group and the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| What could be the potential that if everybody said, hey, there's a way to earn a $1,000 bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| what would be the potential of it would cost Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| Well, if you did, if you said all employees, there's 2,000 employees in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7892)|
| 2:11:38| so 2,000 times 1,000 is, I don't have the calculator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| Two million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| See?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| Two million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| I mean, if everybody did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| And that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| But what you run into, though, is if I tell Dr. Buchanan she can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7912)|
| 2:12:00| but Jason Lay, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| There's a big issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| And don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| I think it's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| I'm not saying that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| I have some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| If you want to hear them, I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| I have other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| It's like a 60-hour course or 120-hour course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7942)|
| 2:12:27| So my first question would be, the program calls something to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7947)|
| 2:12:34| Who pays for the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| Am I, the employee, going to pay for the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| Or is the county going to pay for the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| My other issue would be, if I do it, am I doing this on county time or am I going to do it on my personal time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7963)|
| 2:12:52| You have some issues to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| It's just one person speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| I mean, you know, we can work all these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| But that's some issues that I think would need to be addressed up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| Because even if we said it's $1,000 per person, Dr. Buchanan may say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7985)|
| 2:13:11| you're paying for it, to her employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| And somebody else may say, no, the county will pick that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| And so it's a bigger can of worms than just a payment of $1,000, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=7998)|
| 2:13:26| And that's some of the questions I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| My question for you and for Phil is, is this the time, Chris, that they normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| that you normally pay this bond in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| Isn't that normally when you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| Yeah, I think you've got to pay it out by October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8019)|
| 2:13:40| 31st, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8020)|
| 2:13:41| That's been done by October 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| And that's, you know, that's standard procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| I've got a lot of comments, and I'm just going to save those until the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| I agree with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| The program itself is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| There's not, you know, if you want to take the program, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| Phil, how is the program being, I mean, this has been going on a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| It's not like this is something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| How do you reconcile who takes it, who doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| Is everybody eligible for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| Who pays for the fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| How is that done now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Well, I think it's a $300 fee, and we paid it out of the property assessor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8051)|
| 2:14:17| And it was the first time that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| And, actually, I felt like I had a little bit of misinformation or I didn't dig deep enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| On the $3,000, we felt like that half of it, or $1,500, would have been passed back through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| That only applies to the officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| And, you know, who would be eligible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| I can tell you there's not a lot of people out there clamoring to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| I know that Foster, myself, the trustee, has rode their HR policy over to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| and that might be the place to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| And it might be that for this year that you do something like the $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| or whatever that you would want to do and then fine-tune it for the future or after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8094)|
| 2:15:02| And, like I said, you know, it's really sort of in your park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| With what Chris says, I agree 100%, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| Where do you go with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| But that's a little bit futuristic, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| Up until right here, standing in front of the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| the people that's had a chance to take this could have taken it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| They haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| Why haven't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| You know, I mean, I don't see nobody running out the gate tomorrow breaking down everybody's door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| I mean, some of them have been around five, 10, 15, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| They've not taken it up to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| Same incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| Can you all get us a list of who would be eligible to be paid by October 31st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8137)|
| 2:15:42| I mean, who has taken it and who would be eligible for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| With my office, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Chris, can you find out from the other office holders, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| because you said that normally October 31st is when this is paid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| If we could find out who has done it, let's look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| and then let's look moving forward how do we want to proceed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| I think those that have been involved, we need to let them know something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| if they're going to get anything or not, and then we can look at the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| You know, and we'll talk more about it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| Phil, before you mentioned the $3,000, but that didn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8174)|
| 2:16:23| The reduction on what you got from the state didn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| But this says in this, unless, of course, both of these things you gave us have TCA 5-1-310 attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8186)|
| 2:16:35| I don't know whether there's a different one for elected officials versus employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| but this says that any employee has to be deducted from the maximum of the $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8200)|
| 2:16:52| In other words, if that's the case and the state pays $2,000, the max we could pay would be $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8212)|
| 2:17:03| Yes, but really what has happened is the state only pays $1,500 to the elected official of that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8223)|
| 2:17:12| They don't pay any, am I telling that right, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| Nothing to an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| Years ago, I don't know, because it's just like we had grant money of 61 cents a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| We no longer have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| So I don't know what happened years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| What happened when this program was first started, just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| this program was started so the elected officials in rural counties would have a way to get extra money in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8252)|
| 2:17:43| So what happens now is they take all the elected officials who pass the course, and they get a lump sum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8263)|
| 2:17:49| and the state will say, we're going to pay a total of $200,000 this year to how many ever officials there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8269)|
| 2:17:57| And whatever that comes out to apiece, that's the max the state will pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| So the state, like last year, paid $1,377.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| So then the county would pay the $1,623.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8285)|
| 2:18:11| It's basically when the state started it, it could fund the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| But then as more and more started passing the program, then the state would cut the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8295)|
| 2:18:22| And so now they say, shall pay up to a maximum of $3,000 if you're an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| So the state's paying X amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| Then we can we don't have to, but we can pick up the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| Right now we do not have any cap that differentiates an employee from an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8314)|
| 2:18:41| What you have is that CTAS code that says no more than $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8321)|
| 2:18:47| Well, that just doesn't seem fair when, from what I understand, there have been employees that got $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8327)|
| 2:18:55| One thing I'd like to defer to David just a minute is that when it talks about employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| I think that I did look it up, and they are a definition of county, full-time county employees, which I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8340)|
| 2:19:06| maybe even include the commissioners, but are they not a definition somewhere on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8346)|
| 2:19:12| Well, the commissioners could do it on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| They can do whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| So take them out of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| If they want to vote themselves to do that, they certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| The definition of employee is set out at 29-21-022, which I don't have in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8361)|
| 2:19:28| It's a convoluted series of statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| 5-1-301 initially provides for register, assessor, county clerk, trustee, basically what we know as the constitutional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8371)|
| 2:19:45| And then later, and it refers to Section 8-what is it here, 8-24-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8385)|
| 2:19:56| and that expands it to all of the clerks, clerk and master, circuit court clerk, general sessions clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8396)|
| 2:20:04| criminal court clerk, juvenile clerk, and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| Then we come in, and it doesn't say if the state's going to pay the clerks, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| The state is going to pay, as you indicated, for the constitutional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| Then we come in with 29-20-102, which you referenced in your attachment, for all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8418)|
| 2:20:27| So it is a convoluted type of statute, and I think the CTAS versions are proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8427)|
| 2:20:36| but I think that this commission probably needs a little more information about where the money is coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| and who's going to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| And our office can come up maybe with a little memo on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8443)|
| 2:20:48| and email it to everybody on the commission before Monday, if that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8448)|
| 2:20:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| I'm not going to beat that horse anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| Is Chris still out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| Oh, he's waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| He's still back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| Let me ask you something, Chris, quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| So the only free money, or I shouldn't put it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| the only money from the state covers the elected full-time officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8477)|
| 2:21:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| Possibly in other counties, county commissioners are included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| If they vote themselves into it, then that just splits the pie that many more ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8488)|
| 2:21:33| The state gives X amount, $50 million, split it up to 90-odd counties, and that's the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8493)|
| 2:21:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8499)|
| 2:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| So the TCA code will say a max of $3,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| And as long as you get recertified every year, then you can still have a chance at getting that $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8506)|
| 2:21:53| And so if it's $1,600 from the state this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| then the county can pay the $1,400 to get to a total of $3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| and that would be every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| And then the state's amount is going to fluctuate, so it makes the county amount fluctuate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| But as far as employees, it's all county funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| Only county taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| And you referenced, well, the employee pays it or somebody else pays it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8534)|
| 2:22:19| That's the fee to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| That's the $300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8540)|
| 2:22:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| Bill was talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| It's a $300 fee to sign up for the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| And I guess to me it's how do you quantify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8549)|
| 2:22:33| Is it truly more efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| Does it make the employee more efficient and more productive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| Or is it just a pay raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| I don't want the pay raise, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| But as a commissioner, I want that employee to be more efficient and more productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| And quantifying, it's another story, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8571)|
| 2:22:52| The more you know, the more you keep up, the more efficient you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| In theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| The state has money in its budget to pay the elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8581)|
| 2:23:10| talking about sheriff, trustee, clerks, county clerks, mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8590)|
| 2:23:20| registrar of deeds, assessors of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| That money is coming from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| That money is appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| And if we have an elected official that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| and takes advantage of the University of Tennessee training through CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| they have to go take the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| They have to become a better employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| And to recognize that, they are then paid some money by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| Then the county has the ability to extend that a step further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8633)|
| 2:23:58| and that those same elected officials can look at people that surround them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8638)|
| 2:24:04| that they think need to have additional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8644)|
| 2:24:09| and authorize them to go participate in the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| and end up until the condition or situation that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| Every full-time employee could receive some kind of pay for being a better employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8658)|
| 2:24:26| having attended training in various amounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| whether it be a thousand or some odd number or some $3,000 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8672)|
| 2:24:39| But all of those dollars come out of the desk drawer of that elected official, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| out of that person's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| If it is a fee office, then that would be in their salary suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8687)|
| 2:24:51| and that's where it is paid out of, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| So what we're talking about is elected officials receiving something from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| for doing a better job getting training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| or the elected official selecting an employee to participate in the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| and then paying that employee for going to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| or continuing to maintain that annual certificate of recertification in that particular field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8712)|
| 2:25:23| or whatever all this covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| I've attended three or four of these classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| I view them to be fairly important, not from just the point of view of it's book knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8730)|
| 2:25:36| and you're tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| but you also get to sit for half a day on breaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| or beside a county official or a county employee of an adjacent county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8743)|
| 2:25:49| And sometimes those people are kind of on the ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| because they're out trying to sharpen their skills also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| I believe there's two or three advantages here of people participating in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8756)|
| 2:26:01| This is not a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| This is something you have to work and go get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| It's also something that the elected official has to say that you're going to go get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| In other words, tomorrow, if I were an employee in the Parks and Rec Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| I just couldn't get up and go over to the University of Tennessee, enroll in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| and at the end of so many credit hours get $3,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| It doesn't work that way, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| I believe that the elected official has to take the selected employee sort of under their wing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8789)|
| 2:26:40| or aside or whatever and tell them that they need to go participate in this training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8800)|
| 2:26:46| to be a better employee for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| Now, where does the money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8810)|
| 2:26:59| Does it do the taxpayers any good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| Those are questions that maybe we need to discuss come next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| But the general plan seems to hold a little fair amount of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| in that the University of Tennessee is putting it on on behalf of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| and it is training our local elected county officials to do a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8839)|
| 2:27:25| and the local county full-time employees that are selected to participate in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8845)|
| 2:27:32| become better employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| And it may be worth the few thousand dollars that we're going to expend totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8855)|
| 2:27:42| Now, I think someone's going to come back and present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| Are you going to come back and present how much has been spent like the year before last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| or before this was put on hiatus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| I mean, I don't want something that's going to take an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| Yes, I will have that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| I want something that's easily arrived at, sort of generic, and where we have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8878)|
| 2:28:06| And then I think we can then move from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8886)|
| 2:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| On what Commissioner Wright just said, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8894)|
| 2:28:18| He talked about the person that works in Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8898)|
| 2:28:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| I can get you a job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| Is that going to cause down the road, is that going to be discrimination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| Say you pick another office holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| and that office holder lets every one of their people take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8913)|
| 2:28:37| but the person out mowing yards and stuff like that, he's a full-time paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| he or she is a full-time paid person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| And the person that parks doesn't get to do that, then would they do a lawsuit against us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8923)|
| 2:28:48| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| We can't limit it, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| Well, I think that the commission can limit how it's going to spend its money on which personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8932)|
| 2:28:59| And I think if it's coming out of the salary suit for one of the constitutional offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8939)|
| 2:29:07| they can determine how their money is going to be spent on which people they want and set a level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8947)|
| 2:29:17| But I think that if it comes to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| I think this commission can definitely put its parameters on what levels of employees they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8960)|
| 2:29:28| Do they want mid-level managers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| Do they want however?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| But every department is operating on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| So I believe that every department, at least in the constitutional offices, can do it on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8974)|
| 2:29:40| Now, you take the health department, for instance, which isn't elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8980)|
| 2:29:45| I believe the commission can say that the director of that department can set that department's own parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8985)|
| 2:29:53| I will look into that, though, because that's a very, very interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8993)|
| 2:29:57| And if you want the guy out there that's sweeping sidewalks to be paid by the taxpayer just to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=8997)|
| 2:30:08| And I don't think we want that, although there might be a gem out there somewhere that it would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9008)|
| 2:30:14| But a very good question, and I'll see if I can get an answer to that to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| I know that that's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9019)|
| 2:30:22| And going back to what Commissioner Shouse, Ed, you were talking about, just to review, the taxpayers are paying the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9022)|
| 2:30:29| Was it, Chris, you say $300 to take the course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9029)|
| 2:30:34| $300, Phil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| Taxpayers pay that, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| And the taxpayers are paying that employee while they're off also to take that course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9038)|
| 2:30:46| And the taxpayers, whether it be state or whatever, the taxpayers are paying the $3,000 to $1,000, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9046)|
| 2:30:54| You, as commissioners, ask the people in the coming weeks how many people take continuing ed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9054)|
| 2:31:00| and how many of them make $1,000 for taking their continuing ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| That's all this is, is continuing ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| I agree with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| It's a great, great course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| Not a thing to merit the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| Guys, you get your bonus when you get promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| That's what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| The question I had, Chris, or Phil, with what you've got, Phil, would you get the $1,500 from the state plus $1,000 if this goes through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9077)|
| 2:31:28| Is that how that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9088)|
| 2:31:29| I haven't taken the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| Well, if you had taken the course, as an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| You would receive, I think, up to $1,500 depending on the split, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9093)|
| 2:31:39| It's not automatic $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| And he said the payout was $1,300 and something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| So you'd get the both as an elected official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| Well, you know, since I've not taken it, you know, I would like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| If you had taken the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9114)|
| 2:31:55| I don't think I'd be discounted to make up to $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| And I'm not sure that any of the elected officials do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| But I think Chris is getting you numbers and he could address that at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| So he can see if there's been any officials that's taken that up to $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| Like I said, I'm sort of novice because I just dealt with it for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| Again, my thing is for the planning of the employee, whether he's just taken the test or he's been long term there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9138)|
| 2:32:27| We need to give him an answer before October 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| Yeah, I understand that completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| Yeah, I think we had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| You said on the news we had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| One lady wanted to take the course and the elected official said I wasn't up to it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9156)|
| 2:32:42| But, you know, I look at that as a lawsuit, Dave, as, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| So I just want it to be fair, just fair across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| Motion on the floor is to send without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| There was a resolution added regarding a change in commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9180)|
| 2:33:07| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9187)|
| 2:33:08| Move to send forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| I think and I'll direct this to our Deputy Law Director at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9195)|
| 2:33:22| I just don't think this is going to fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| I'm all for needing help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| But I think this gross violation with the Voting Rights Act, I think this will take the minority voting strength down significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9210)|
| 2:33:42| I think our last process going from 19 to 11, you know, we kind of danced on that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9222)|
| 2:33:51| But it was a percent or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| But I just think this one is probably going to push that way over the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9233)|
| 2:33:59| So what I'd ask is that between now and Monday the law department take a look at that and see what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9239)|
| 2:34:07| or if this is even doable to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9247)|
| 2:34:13| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| Sam, I think if, you know, of course it depends on how it's divided up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| If there's two minority districts, you know, here, you know, you get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| And if it's not, you get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9263)|
| 2:34:24| And you just don't know what's going to happen with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| You know, one of the concerns, though, that was brought up at the Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| and you weren't here when this was brought up, is that by having the two at-large commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9271)|
| 2:34:37| that that also may be a problem too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9277)|
| 2:34:42| And we had the discussion with Commissioner Wright at the Charter Review Committee on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9282)|
| 2:34:49| And I likewise have some, you know, have some concerns that someone from the public spoke to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9289)|
| 2:34:58| And it really deals with, I'm talking about two of my favorite people here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| It deals with the at-large commissioners, you know, about how they fit in, you know, with all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| And I know he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9308)|
| 2:35:09| And there was some thought that that may not survive a court challenge by having the at-large commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9309)|
| 2:35:18| And that person felt that if you, if that really went to a court challenge, it would not, you know, would not survive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9318)|
| 2:35:31| And I understand Commissioner Wright's concerns about having a geographically large district to try to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9331)|
| 2:35:40| You know, my own personal feelings about it, and they're not real strong either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| is that the commission is working very well right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9346)|
| 2:35:49| that to have a third redistricting committee in about as many years would really just confuse things more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9349)|
| 2:35:57| I still have people call me that used to be in my district that voted for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| and then they want to know why I'm not their commissioner anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| And to do that now, you know, a third time in four years, I think is muddying the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9363)|
| 2:36:11| You know, I would submit, if someone would entertain hearing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9371)|
| 2:36:14| and this gets a little bit off of what Dave was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| if we did want to put something on the ballot, it would be to eliminate the two at-large commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9379)|
| 2:36:29| but keep the commission districts the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| And the reason I would argue for that, it would avoid the voter confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9391)|
| 2:36:35| We still have the commission districts lining up with the school districts, and that was a big issue at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9395)|
| 2:36:41| And we retain the responsibility of one commissioner per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9401)|
| 2:36:49| One of the things that I've noticed is that when someone sends a letter to the commission about a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9409)|
| 2:36:56| I'll usually write back to them and say, Did anyone answer to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| I'll get my thing and say, Did anyone else answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| And a lot of times the answer is no, and I think that gets down to responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9421)|
| 2:37:05| Or somebody will write me back and say, You're the only one that answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| And I can understand why everyone does, is that, you know, sometimes we don't know where the people live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9428)|
| 2:37:14| They don't know what district they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| And I do like the idea of having, I guess I'm sort of arguing for what Commissioner Wright is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9437)|
| 2:37:22| Now, I do like having the idea of one commissioner per district, because there you have responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| We know who has to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| And he gave a very eloquent discussion a couple of times ago at the Charter Review Committee about having more ears listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9451)|
| 2:37:40| But I think sometimes you get to having too many chefs in the commission and nobody's listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| And that's why I would still like to have one commission per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| I think if you had nine commissioners in nine districts without changing it that line up with the school board, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9469)|
| 2:37:57| that's not a bad system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| And it would also address the concerns about the commissioners at large is that it dilutes the minority representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9478)|
| 2:38:05| And that would be, you know, I guess that would be one of my choices on how to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9485)|
| 2:38:11| But you're cutting the people's representation down even more by eliminating the two at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9491)|
| 2:38:18| At least they got one and a ninth or two ninths in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9498)|
| 2:38:22| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| But to me, I think there was a pretty good, I mean, I know Dave has looked at this a lot more than I have about the legality of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9504)|
| 2:38:36| and the potential court challenges to the commission at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| And he could speak to it better than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| But I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9522)|
| 2:38:43| But I don't, you know, I think to have, you know, one and one ninth of a representative is not a whole lot better than having one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9523)|
| 2:38:54| Well, when you look at the fact, though, when you look at the budget that we have, it used to take 11 people to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9534)|
| 2:39:09| Then we're down now to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| Then we're talking about if we do that, we're going to come down to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| Pretty soon we'll be back to the old county court days, three people running everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| And that's not what I don't, that's not what the people don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9560)|
| 2:39:23| I do not believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| I think the people want some representation sitting up in these chairs, and I think they want more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9564)|
| 2:39:30| You know, I mean, at least what I've heard when I'm out in the community right now, I hear a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9570)|
| 2:39:37| I mean, you know, we can make a good argument about leaving it where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| I'm just talking about the legality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9580)|
| 2:39:45| What I'm hearing out in the community right now, people are pretty satisfied with how the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9585)|
| 2:39:50| Well, maybe we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| Maybe we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| I've not, to be honest with you, I've not heard a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| And I've heard a lot of compliments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9598)|
| 2:39:59| Not one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| You've got to be serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9601)|
| 2:40:02| You can't be serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9602)|
| 2:40:03| Well, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9603)|
| 2:40:04| I mean, no one, I mean, of course, nobody is going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| Well, I don't want to interrupt your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9608)|
| 2:40:09| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| There's not going to be an answer, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| No, my, and I'm going to get to Commissioner Shouse here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| I don't have a dog in the fight here because I'm term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9616)|
| 2:40:19| I'm not running again for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| And so whatever the people of Knox County decide is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| I guess my concern is that under our rules, we would pass this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9627)|
| 2:40:34| We're then required to have public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| And then we would come back and pass it on a second reading if this passes, which would be September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9637)|
| 2:40:43| And then it's that time to get it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| So we're actually looking at something that's going to be on the ballot in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| So I have no problem at all going to our citizens and saying, are you satisfied with the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9650)|
| 2:40:56| Do you like the way we're doing things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| I mean, let's get aggressive and go out in the community and ask people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| Let's do it district by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| And let's say, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9662)|
| 2:41:03| Do you think we need to have 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| Do we need 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| Do we need to have 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| I mean, you know, I mean, we don't have to necessarily do a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| but we can go out in the community and hold public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| I have had no one come up to me and say, I think that we need to go to, I don't like the at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9675)|
| 2:41:23| or that we need to go to 13 or 15 or go back to 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| I have had no member of the public tell me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| I have had members of this body tell me that, that we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| But no one, no one from the public has come up to me, and I'm out in the public a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9694)|
| 2:41:39| You've got us to have grumpy friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| Well, maybe so, because I've had no one say anything to me about the makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| I mean, I've heard a lot of compliments about the way we're doing our business now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| And, of course, no one is going to come up to me and say, well, you suck, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| But, you know, they just don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| But, I mean, it's one of those things where I would like to hear from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9713)|
| 2:41:56| and let's get their views, because I don't have a problem doing whatever the public wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9716)|
| 2:42:00| But they voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| Now, you know, the threat of court challenge, that goes in one ear to me and out the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| If somebody wants to challenge, let them challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| Let them go to court and file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| But to me, the public voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| That's what they have voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| This is what we're under right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| So now we're saying, okay, maybe you didn't understand what you were voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| Maybe this, maybe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| Well, the fact is they did vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9742)|
