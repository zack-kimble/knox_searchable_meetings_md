| 0:00:41| We do have a quorum, so Mr. Swanson, I'm going to turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=41)|
| 0:00:46| I know that Mr. Hultquist is in the building, so let's just wait a second or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| There's Mr. Becker arriving now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=50)|
| 0:00:52| I think they had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| Then if we can get Mr. Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| He wants to get some water from upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| And Chris Woodhull is five minutes behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| They just had a meeting about Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| Hi, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Are there any preliminary matters that you need to take up with the hearing officer before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| we get to the proof they need to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| I sort of suspected that there might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| As a matter of levity, I'd like to say hello to all my brothers and sisters in TV land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| who chastised me and the law director today for keeping them up until 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| Please, a hearing officer, yesterday or last night, I had asked Mr. Swanson to take judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=88)|
| 0:01:39| notice of a document called the Knoxville Police Cadet Program and the police explorers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=99)|
| 0:01:49| And he said if I would retrieve that off the Internet, he would do so, which we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| And I have that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| And it would be submitted as an exhibit for which he would take judicial notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| Actually, I said I would consider taking judicial notice of it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| Have you shared that with counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| I've showed it to him, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Is there any objection to that being admitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| Mr. Swanson, Mr. Bell showed it to Ms. Ebertine and to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| If he tells me it came off the city's website, I'd accept his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| And I have no objection to it being admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| It will be received as defense exhibit number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| I'm sorry, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| Defense exhibit number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| If you would tender that to the court reporter, we're going to change our procedure just a little bit tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| because we have to have someone to monitor the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| So we're going to tender exhibits directly to the court reporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| Could you find a microphone, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| I'm sorry, but we really can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Motion for better acoustics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| Exhibit 3A, defense exhibit 3A, would be the cadet program webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| And 3B would be the police explorers post 300 off their webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=187)|
| 0:03:21| After those are marked, would you just pass those around to the members of the beer board so they can review those in advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=207)|
| 0:03:49| Are there other preliminary matters that need to be taken up prior to recommencing the proof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=229)|
| 0:03:58| Mr. Kaiser wants to introduce, without objection, we have none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| Some exhibits, if you want to go ahead and just introduce them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| one of which I believe is a self-authenticating document anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| We have no objection except as to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| I think it's admissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| But, as you know, in order to, one of which is the death certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| and it's got, in order to make the nexus between Michaels and the death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| there's got to be competent producing evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| And there's a, we're not stipulating as to causation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| We're just stipulating as that there was, in fact, a death as a result of a vehicle or accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| You are stipulating the accuracy of that exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| and you are stipulating that it will be admissible in the trial for the limited purpose of showing that death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| And you don't stipulate any other reason for the admission of that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| And so, therefore, it would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| And we would ask for a limiting instruction, if you would, to the members of the board, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| I will do that after all the members of the board are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Mr. Swanson, Mr. Bell mentioned the three documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Let me just go ahead and explain what those are on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| and then they can be passed around if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| I've gone ahead and pre-marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Exhibit 13 will be the driver's license of Jonathan Frederick Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| Exhibit 14 will be a certified copy of the death certificate of Jonathan Frederick Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| And Exhibit 15 is an official alcohol report prepared by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| That will be Exhibit 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| And then, at the appropriate time in the testimony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| I may ask the next witness to refer to one or more of these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| The driver's license is 13 death certificates, 14 alcohol reports, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Those three exhibits will be received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Now we have Mr. Hawquist, so we're just one down, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=367)|
| 0:06:20| So these are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| I can go ahead and pass them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Let him mark them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| I've already pre-marked them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| Mr. Swanson, whenever you're ready, I'll be ready to call the next witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| I don't know if we're waiting for someone still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| We are waiting for Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Who is in route, we are told, and should be here within a matter of a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| I didn't realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| And then we'll give a limiting instruction with regard to the death certificate to the members of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| and then we'll proceed with the proof, if that's satisfactory with the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=410)|
| 0:07:21| Let me ask this just as far as procedural goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| After Mr. Stives marks the exhibits, do you want those passed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Well, we don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Whenever he wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Pass to the beer board members, you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| It probably would be just as well to do it that way so they'll have an opportunity to pass them around and examine them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| And if during your questioning you need the witness to refer to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| we'll just find out where they are and collect them at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=470)|
| 0:08:17| I think we need to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=497)|
| 0:08:48| It is indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=528)|
| 0:09:04| Mr. Woodhull is in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| Oh, he's in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=546)|
| 0:09:17| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=557)|
| 0:09:38| If we can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| We should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| I think we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| He was bringing us the food, that's why he was late, so he's excused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| All right, just for the record, we'll note that all the members of the beer board are now present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| And with all of the members of the beer board present, I would like to advise the members of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| that we have received, by stipulation, three exhibits presented by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| including a copy of the driver's license of Mr. Hatcher, a copy of the death certificate of Mr. Hatcher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=612)|
| 0:10:20| a copy of a TBI alcohol report related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| And with regard to the death certificate, I want to give you a limiting instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| The parties have stipulated that it is admissible evidence in this matter for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=632)|
| 0:10:40| They have stipulated only that it shows the death of Mr. Hatcher and the time and the information that is contained on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| There is no stipulation in this case that Mr. Hatcher's activities at the Michaels restaurant was related to his death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=648)|
| 0:11:02| They do not stipulate that, and that is not stipulated in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| And that will be something for you all to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| Well, I don't even really think that's for you all to determine one way or the other in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| But that is not something that has been stipulated by the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| and I caution you not to accept that death certificate as evidence that his death is related to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| is necessarily related to Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| Counsel, is that a sufficient limiting instruction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Where's Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Well, I'm a little bit concerned about the language not necessarily related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| That just shouldn't be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| It's not stipulated that it's related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| I will use the language that it is not stipulated that it is related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| That will be a matter for the lawyers to bring to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| I would ask for further instruction that causation is an essential element that must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=723)|
| 0:12:14| If we were trying a death case, I'd be happy to give that instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| but that's not really what we're doing here, so I don't feel comfortable in giving that instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Well...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| It will be up to them to determine the extent to which...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| I'm equivocating with you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| But, however, this gets into what we were challenging last night, the, quote, totality of the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=752)|
| 0:12:41| And we objected to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| And so the director can reflect we have a continuing objection because in order to tie it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=763)|
| 0:12:55| it's not relevant that this young man died, for example, if he was, had consumed alcohol at another establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=775)|
| 0:13:05| if he had purchased beer, as was shown last night, after he left Michael's at another establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| if he had a medical condition that contributed to his death that is unrelated to the Michael's allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=792)|
| 0:13:21| And because of the vagueness of the charges in this matter, we object| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| and would ask specifically for limiting instruction as to the legal cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| or the competent producing cause of this issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| I have given a limiting instruction that with regard to the death certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| the Michael's representatives have not in any way stipulated that the introduction of the death certificate implies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| that there is causation between the young man's death and his activities at Michael's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| I don't feel comfortable giving a limiting instruction beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| The rest of that will be a matter of proof for the various representatives of the parties to prove to the beer board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=843)|
| 0:14:11| So I think we've got everything on the record we need to have with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| Is the city ready to go forward with proof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| The city is ready, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Call your next witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| We would register an objection to the witness taking any notes to the witness stand with him until such time as it is demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=866)|
| 0:14:50| that he needs to refer to such notes because of prior recollection refresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| He agrees with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Mr. Keiser, to sustain your objection, has this witness sworn in last night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=901)|
| 0:15:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| And your testimony will continue to be under oath pursuant to the oath of last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Mr. Keiser, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| Do you know why he's testifying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| State your name, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| I am Darryl Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| How old are you, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Thirty-five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| You're employed by Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| What is your rank, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| I'm a sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| How long have you been employed by the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Twelve years in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Did you respond to a call on southbound Alcoa Highway on May 15, 2006?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Approximately what time was that call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| It was approximately 7.57 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| Where in the vicinity of what landmark is that on Alcoa Highway where that call was that you responded to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| Southbound on Alcoa Highway near I.C. King Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| When you arrived at that location, what did you observe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| I observed what appeared to be a scene of a motor vehicle accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| A guardrail was bent back, debris on the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| I did not see a vehicle at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| But then upon exiting my vehicle, I saw an overturned SUV that was down an embankment resting on its top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=984)|
| 0:16:34| Did the debris include glass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Yes, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| If you were driving on Alcoa Highway, would you have been able to see the vehicle down below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Were any other emergency responders on the scene when you arrived?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Yes, the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| And if I can recall correctly, I believe Royal Metro Ambulance Service was already on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1013)|
| 0:17:02| Did you observe the driver of the vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Was it a male, a white male?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Was he inside the car or outside the car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Partially ejected, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Did you observe injuries on him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Injection now, for the record, he asked me if he observed the driver of the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| And that is a conclusion not supported by any testimony of this witness or the examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1039)|
| 0:17:29| Let me rephrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| Did you see a person in or near the vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| Yes, I did, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Can you describe, for the record, his location relative to the vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Partially ejected from the driver area, driver's seat area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Did you observe injuries on this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| In generally what areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Injuries to the upper torso, head area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| Were there any vital signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Did you have, on that occasion, did you have a reason to touch the exhaust pipe and the engine block on the vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| Yes, I most certainly did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| What was the reason for doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| The reason why I touched the vehicle's exhaust and the engine block is I'm trying to establish a time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1088)|
| 0:18:17| as to ascertain how long the vehicle had been down the embankment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| How can you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Well, let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Were the exhaust and the engine block hot or cold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| They were ice cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| What does that indicate to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| If I may address this, this is a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| Could you find a microphone, Mr. Bell, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| The city has not provided notice that they intend to call an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| In any city in America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| testimony by experts is governed by scientific, technical, or other specified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| other specified knowledge that would substantially assist the trial of fact to understand the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| or to determine the fact of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| That person must first be qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| That foundation has not yet been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| Secondly, the Rule 705 and the companion federal counterpart that governs matters in federal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1154)|
| 0:19:24| require that there be disclosure of facts or data underlining the expert opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| First of all, this witness has not been qualified as an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| Secondly, there's been no disclosure of such facts necessary in order to enable this witness to express any opinion whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1174)|
| 0:19:45| He is merely, and I don't, Darrell, you and I have been friends for many years, but he merely testified he's a police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1185)|
| 0:19:56| which is a very fine profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| But for him, as you know, there's various disciplines in accident reconstruction, accident investigation, yada, yada, yada,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| and sub-disciplines, as we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| So it seems the city is now seeking to claim from this witness opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1210)|
| 0:20:22| without introducing at least a foundation by you, a trustworthy data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1222)|
| 0:20:31| Mr. Bell, I understand the nature of your objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I also understand that it's not necessary to have expert proof when things are a matter of common knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| a matter of common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| So far he has testified that in touching the exhaust pipe in the engine block and they were cool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| that was some evidence to him that it had been there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| He has not attempted to say at this point exactly how long the vehicle had been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| or what the time of death might have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| If he gets into those areas, you may renew your objection at that point, but he hadn't gotten there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| But he hadn't testified as to what the temperature of the outside air was versus the temperature of the inside air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1263)|

| 0:21:13| That's why you get to cross-examine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1273)|

| 0:24:46| You did not know this young man's health history?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| You did not check the young man to determine his body temperature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1491)|
| 0:25:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| We saw him there at the scene of the accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| You did not determine whether or not the blood of this young man had pooled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1513)|
| 0:25:21| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Settled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| As far as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I'm of your examination of his blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Levitity or are you talking about levitity in the body or I don't recall seeing any levitity or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1528)|
| 0:25:37| Did you take his clothes off and do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| No, sir, I sure did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| You know, as I take it in your training, that's essential if you're going to try to determine time of death?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1542)|
| 0:25:52| Well, the reason I didn't do that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| I didn't ask you why you didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| I asked you if you know that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Yes, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Now, did you secure the scene for a crime scene investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1558)|
| 0:26:09| As far as putting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Did you secure the scene insofar as a crime scene investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Would you please tell us your point of reference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| What was your frame of reference for the crime scene investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| As far as how big the scene was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Just the immediate area where the vehicle had struck the guardrail and had rolled down the embankment probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| You're telling us what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| He's trying to answer, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| He's being interrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| He is being interrupted, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Well, then I object to his answer for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| He's testifying about something he didn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| I'm asking him to give us the geographical location of what would be the crime scene investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| You're objecting to the answer that you asked for, and he's trying to give you that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| We're going to let him give that answer, and then you can object to it at the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| Let me rephrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| As far as the locations, did you do a point A, point B, a triangular or a square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| a rectangle box for the crime scene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| In a traffic accident investigation, in order to pass that information on to a traffic accident reconstructionist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1643)|
| 0:27:31| you know that's essential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| I am a traffic accident reconstructionist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| And you do know that's essential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| I didn't do a triangular method, if that's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| I didn't do it by triangulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| I didn't do it that way, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Did you do a reference point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| I found a reference point, which was, I believe, without looking at my notes, I think was maybe a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| I'm thinking it was a telephone pole or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| And then I measured off of that reference point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| Now, with that in mind, when you prepared an initial report, you recorded the young man's age as 21, did you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1679)|
| 0:28:12| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1692)|
| 0:28:28| Mark that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1708)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1737)|
| 0:29:10| Recorded on one of your reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Mr. Bell, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to find a microphone because we really need to get this on the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| And it doesn't, while we can hear you to a certain extent when you raise your voice, it does not make it to the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1764)|
| 0:29:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| On your accident report, or one of them, and I'll bring it forward here in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| you had found 12 unopened cans of beer in the, this individual's vehicle, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1795)|
| 0:30:05| I don't remember if the number was specifically 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| And they weren't inside the vehicle, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| They were in the vicinity lying around the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| There was a cooler as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| They weren't, there was a bunch of debris that had been tossed out of the vehicle during the tumbling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| I don't know if I recorded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| It may have been 12 that I counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I'm not, I've got to refer to my notes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1834)|
| 0:30:56| Did you observe several unopened cans of Busch Light beer scattered around the scene of the accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1856)|
| 0:31:14| Yes, sir, several unopened 12-ounce cans of Busch Light beer scattered around the scene of the accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| And part of the history you obtained in your investigation was that the deceased had been at a Monterey Mexican restaurant in Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1881)|
| 0:31:32| Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| You also determined that the young man had drunk no alcoholic beverages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| when you spoke with his mother who advised you that he never drank alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| Objected to hearsay, Mr. Swanson, with respect to what the mother advised the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| Well, this is part of your investigation, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| Being part of the investigation doesn't cure a hearsay problem, does it, Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| It didn't last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Well, no, but you can't blame me for trying to do what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Objection is sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| At least we're consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1930)|
| 0:32:30| Were you the police officer that went by the pilot station on Alcoa Highway and obtained the videotape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Who was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I believe that was Officer Donnie Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| And Officer Husky brought the videotape that showed the 24-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| Did you review that videotape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| The videotape, in point of fact, based upon your knowledge as a police officer in charge of the investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1972)|
| 0:33:01| showed this young man purchasing alcohol at the pilot on the night in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| I believe he said he didn't see the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Well, based upon his knowledge of the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| Well, anything that he didn't see the tape, anything else would be hearsay, and I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| All right, let me ask you this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| The Knoxville Police Department lost the tape, didn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| As far as I have no idea, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| As far as I know, the tape was not able to be picked up because of the fact that it was erased or something or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2009)|
| 0:33:39| I don't know if we even confiscated the tape or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| I'm unsure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| In your charge of the investigation, what happened to the tape that showed him buying beer at the pilot before he died?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| This question is assuming facts, not in evidence, asking this witness to speculate on things he's already said he doesn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| When you say it assumes facts and not in evidence, what facts do you refer to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| The fact that Mr. Bell said, what happened to this tape that shows this young man buying beer at the pilot the night he died?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| Well, that's not in evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Mr. Bell keeps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| I don't think that was a part of that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| That part of that question started off with, you're in charge of this investigation, and then asked the question, did he know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| Maybe I misheard it, but I heard that somewhere in that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| I think that might have been a little bit previous, so I'm going to overrule that objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Mr. Bell, would you ask the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| Where, oh, where is the videotape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Could you do it in a way that's not argumentative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Where is the videotape that was confiscated from the pilot's station on Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| on or about the date of this accident, which would have been referred to in accident report number 9280868?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2086)|
| 0:34:56| Ask and answer the objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Overrule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| You can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Mr. Bell, as far as I know, the video does not show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| Where is the video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| I don't have a clue, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I don't have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| The police department would have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| What you all do is look for clues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Who's got the clues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Don't make speeches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Whoever's in confiscations or whoever confiscated it, sir, I didn't confiscate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| You're not keeping inventory log?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Yes, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| I'm asking questions that are probative and I'm entitled to ask close, careful, cross-examination questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2127)|
| 0:35:34| The question you were asking was does he keep an evidence log, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| And I think that's a permissible question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| Objection is overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| No, I didn't take an evidence log of videotape that was confiscated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| You keep an evidence log?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Do you keep an evidence log on this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Not on that video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Do you keep an evidence log on this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Does your evidence log on this case show that there was a video confiscated from the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2160)|
| 0:36:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Tell us why it does not if there was in point of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| I have no idea, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Well, who was supposed to report it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Whoever confiscated the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2179)|
| 0:36:28| Whoever confiscated the tape was supposed to turn it over to you for processing, wasn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| As far as I'm concerned, they turned it directly into the confiscations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Now, how did it go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| I was told there was nothing on the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| I didn't ask you what you were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| So I didn't see any reason in looking at the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Whoa, whoa, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| You're both talking at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Officer, please wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Don't start to answer the question, please, until he's completed his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| I know that's sometimes difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| But wait until he's completed the question before you start to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Mr. Bell, when he's answering the question, please don't interrupt him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| Let him finish his answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| And if you need to redirect the question in some way, you can do that through me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Let's go real slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Mr. Bell, you completely understand the question, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| The videotape went to confiscation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| As far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Where did it go after confiscation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| I don't have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Who in the world at the Knoxville Police Department would have a clue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| I'm sure someone in confiscation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Hold up one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| I think there's an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Ask and answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Who's in charge of confiscation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| There are several people up there at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Well, who was in charge of it at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2266)|
| 0:38:01| Well, now, you volunteered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| He objects to the hearsay, but you somehow been a good officer of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| That would get it in on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| And you told us somebody told you there's nothing on the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Who in the world told you that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Oh, he had the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| That's what I tried to tell you earlier, that he had confiscated the tape, but you wouldn't let me tell you that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| Now we know that Officer Husky confiscated the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| What did he tell you he did with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| He didn't tell us about the tape last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| I'm sure he put it in confiscations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Well, did he tell you what happened to the tape after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| Now, did you record the temperature of the beer cans when you saw them that were at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2320)|
| 0:38:50| or near the accident scene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Do you think that's important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I mean, I didn't, I don't, I don't get down and record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| If you're asking if I get down and record temperatures of beer cans, no, I don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| It may or may not be important, but I didn't, I did not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2349)|
| 0:39:17| This young man was not restrained by any seat belt device?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| I'd have to refer to my notes to see if he was restrained or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2367)|

| 0:40:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| The Knoxville Police Department suspected that this young man was under the influence of an intoxicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2436)|
| 0:40:47| And in point of fact, he had him transported to UT Hospital for what you call a legal blood draw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| an alcohol toxicology request, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| And you found beer cans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| I assume that you being in charge there, you seized the beer cans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| Did you make a picture of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| I'm sure there are pictures on file, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| I'm going to ask you if there are pictures on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Did you make a picture of the beer cans so that the world can know about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| I didn't make the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Crime Lab does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| You call the Crime Lab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Crime Lab came out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Did they make pictures of the beer cans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| I'm sure they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Do you know if they did or didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Sir, I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| I looked at the pictures, but I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| I'm sure they took pictures of the beer cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Did you move the beer cans from when you first found them by the time the Crime Lab got there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| So if there are pictures of beer cans in the photographs, they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| They had not been moved from where you found them, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| Well, unless the fire department guys in there, when they were trying to extract this young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| unless they moved them around, then they were not moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Did you chart that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Did you chart that the beer cans had been moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| So whether they were moved or not, you don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| I don't have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Now, may I approach the witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Let's see what you've taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2540)|
| 0:42:47| Do you have that document in your file, a request for a blood draw on this young man?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2567)|
| 0:42:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| I should have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| You be sure and look at your whole file there if you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2588)|
| 0:43:27| Yes, I do have it here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Now, Officer Sands was the one that made the request for the alcohol blood draw, legal blood draw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2612)|
| 0:43:41| Yes, he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| And will you tell the members of the board what time that draw was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2624)|
| 0:43:53| Well, according to the notes here, it looks like Officer Sands failed to write that time in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Does it have on there who signed and witnessed the blood draw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2645)|
| 0:44:18| The only thing that says evidence submitted by D. Sands, it does not have anything beside in the collected portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2658)|
| 0:44:27| It does not have a signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| It looks like he has failed to do that as well, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| So we don't know who drew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| We don't know the mechanism which they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| We don't know the time they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| And we don't know how it was preserved, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| It was drawn at UT Hospital in the morgue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| And Officer Sands witnessed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2688)|
| 0:45:01| Have you seen those TBI boxes for draw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Did you see the form filled out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| That's the form you're referring to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| The form that comes with the legal box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| It's TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| This is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| This is what comes with the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| That's the front side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| You have the back side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| There's not a back side of that form that I'm aware of, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| Well, on these biological specimens, they have a lot number, do they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| And they do have a date and an expiration date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| And did you record that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Officer Sands was in charge of that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| I did not record that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Did you record it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| I have no idea, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Not on your reports, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| It doesn't mention whether or not it was swabbed with a iodine swab stick or an alcohol swab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2758)|
| 0:46:07| or anything that might possibly cause an elevation within the blood, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| No, I don't think there's even a slot on the request form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| I don't think there's a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| It even allows you to indicate anything like that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2786)|
| 0:46:44| Wait until you get to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| On the back of your alcohol draw there are instructions as to how that is to be done, isn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2808)|
| 0:46:59| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| You don't have those instructions in your file, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| No, sir, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| And you cannot tell the members of this board whether or not those instructions were followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| because they're not charted by Officer Sands, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| No, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2838)|
| 0:47:38| Can you tell us by looking at your file what the expiration date was of the anticoagulant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2858)|
| 0:47:47| and what the mixture of the anticoagulant was for the blood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| No, sir, I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Tell us how the anticoagulant was distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| No, sir, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Know that if it is not distributed evenly throughout the blood that it is suspect and subject to error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2879)|
| 0:48:10| and an elevated chemical test result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| Could you repeat that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| You know that if the anticoagulant, if properly, and they've all got a shelf life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| but if it's proper and they're not properly distributed within the blood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| that it can affect the integrity of the reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| I did not know that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| It says so on the instructions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| I mean, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Do you ever read the instructions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| Yes, I have, but I just didn't recall that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Now that I've reminded you of it, you do remember that, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2928)|
| 0:48:59| Now, we mentioned we got away from the beer cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| Let me get back to that a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Looking at your file, does it show if the beer cans were confiscated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| and taken into custody by anybody with Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| Does it show that they were even tagged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Get to the relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Of course it's relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Alcohol beer cans found at the scene of a vehicle homicide for which they're trying to shut down a eating establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| I think it's very relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| It's not a vehicular homicide case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| You're right, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| It's not, but this is the kind of testimony that he's been testifying about what he found at the scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| and what he did at the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| So I'm going to overrule that objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| No, they were not tagged, inventoryed, confiscated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=2990)|
| 0:50:02| That's part of your training, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Well, as far as I'm concerned, sir, I couldn't put those in the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| I couldn't put those cans in the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I mean, they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| They were laying around the vehicle, outside the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| They were not inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Like I said, everything had been slung out of the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| There was debris laying everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| So I could not put those in the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| Well, let's, if you want to do that, Darrell, we'll do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| And I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| And it is not part of my training to gather up everything like that and confiscate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| I don't want to demean you, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Now, Mr. Bell, Mr. Bell, you're just carrying on a colloquy now with this witness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| and there are no questions and answers involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| So let's not do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Let me just tell him, I'm going to ask you some questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| And don't take these personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| This area where you found the car was not a parking lot, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| This area where you found the car was not a pedestrian area, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| No, it was not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| This area where you found the car was off the roadway, in the woods, in the bushes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3074)|
| 0:51:22| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| It was not something that you could ride a mule through very easily, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| There was no evidence of habitation one mile to the west, was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| There wasn't any evidence of habitation one mile to the east, was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| There wasn't any evidence of habitation one mile to the south, was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| There wasn't any evidence of habitation one mile to the north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| Now, what you found around that car was a cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| You found no other beverages, did you, but that beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| No other beverages but the beer, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| You saw no other person sitting around the scene drinking beer, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| I'm working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3146)|
| 0:52:36| There was other items of evidence which you found at or near the car in addition to the beer cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3156)|
| 0:52:45| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| You found clothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| You found articles of personal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| You found other items that you identified as belonging to or relating to the person of the deceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3175)|
| 0:53:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3184)|
| 0:53:12| And you still to this very day have no other suspects other than the deceased as to whose beer that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| No, sir, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Now, have you carefully looked at your notes there to make sure that you have given us your full and complete testimony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3203)|
| 0:53:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| May I see your notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3214)|
| 0:54:01| I can't hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3244)|
| 0:54:18| Let's do it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Can you come around and I'll get a mic and let's gather around everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| What are we doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Because this is part of his file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| Is there a way I can get you to give us a copy of this so we can introduce that to the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| We can make a copy at a later time to file as an exhibit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| Harold, will you come around, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| We've got beer board members over here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| I'm going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| For the record, and we're not going to mark on yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| but we're going to make a copy and then you're going to put it next where your finger is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| This is Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Will you show us the area where you found the wreckage of the vehicle and just hold it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| If the members of the beer board would like to gather around on this side so you can see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| I'm going to walk you around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Well, there's no use in doing this three or four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Come on around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Take a look at what they're looking at so we don't have to do this but once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Where the yellow is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Yes, they're mostly down the embankment down in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| We need a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| We need to get this on tape, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| Mostly in the area where the yellow is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| Where the accident wreckage was found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3338)|
| 0:55:51| We will pass this to them, but because we don't have and we want to maintain the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3351)|
| 0:55:58| of his file, we'll introduce a substituted copy and he'll put a mark on this and make it exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| defense exhibit number four, five, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3365)|
| 0:56:13| What did he say, four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Defense exhibit four is the photograph of the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3374)|
| 0:56:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3384)|
| 0:56:45| Now, the bear that you found, I'm coming back up here in a minute, that you saw in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3405)|
| 0:56:52| Just one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| If you may, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| It's very important that the members of the beer board only refer to evidence that is introduced in this trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| and is adduced in this trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| So I would ask any beer board member that might be referring to any other material or might put that away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| and only refer to what is introduced in the trial through exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Are we doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| You may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Are we doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| If we are, then we need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| It would be like a jury using a dictionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| We have no dictionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| But as a member, may I inquire whether or not a member of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| I don't know whether a member is or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| I'm just saying that we need to give that cautionary instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| And I've done so because we've had jury members, I mean, beer board members coming up and around and looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3456)|
| 0:57:46| Was the beer that you found there dispersed among the debris that you have attributed to the deceased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3466)|
| 0:57:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Was any beer found that was not among that debris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| I don't recall, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| May I approach again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3487)|
| 0:58:45| May I have just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3525)|
| 0:59:09| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3551)|
| 0:59:41| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3581)|
| 1:00:11| Cigars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Cigars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Cigars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3614)|
| 1:00:24| Anything further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| My throat is just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| Hot days and cold days just don't mix with me very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| Of this witness, no, except as it relates to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| It comes now, Michaels, and moves to withdraw the stipulation as to the alcohol result, the chemical test result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3655)|
| 1:01:05| based upon the testimony of the witness, which now makes it impossible to show a proper legal chain of custody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3665)|
| 1:01:22| and a proper legal medical draw and the failure of the city to prosecution, the city of Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3682)|
| 1:01:34| to lay a proper foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| What we have is now a non-relevant reading that is worthless insofar as this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3698)|
| 1:01:50| but it may be construed because of the language in the charging instrument that has us here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3710)|
| 1:01:58| that is to say, the totality of the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| And therefore, based now upon the cross-examination of this witness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| that stipulation that was made to us because it was facts not yet made known to us is now respectfully withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3729)|
| 1:02:25| I can go ahead and rule on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| I understand the motion that you've made, and I'm going to overrule that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| You're going to have the opportunity to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| You've just made that argument once before the Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| and you'll have yet another opportunity to make that argument before the Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| but I'm going to overrule your motion to withdraw the stipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| Then I would ask Mr. Swanson that you give a curative instruction to the members of the Beer Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3770)|
| 1:03:00| as to the legal effect of a failure to preserve evidence and as to spoliation of evidence as governed by Tennessee law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3780)|
| 1:03:12| and the missing evidence instruction because based on the testimony of this nice young, well-intentioned officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3792)|
| 1:03:26| there were many mistakes made and many mistakes observed by him, not only by himself but by others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3806)|
| 1:03:35| And so we have three issues, one, spoliation of evidence, lost evidence, destruction of evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3815)|
| 1:03:43| And because of that, I would ask for a limited instruction that would cure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| and deal with those issues as they are now before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| I understand that the bulk of your practice deals with a criminal defense practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| This is not debate and this is not argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| This is my ruling on your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Actually-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| I don't want to hear anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Mr. Bell, I'll let you talk until you're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| And now I would appreciate it very much if you would let me talk until I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Can we do it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Mr. Bell, Mr. Bell, I will give you another opportunity to speak after I am finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| Can we do it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| Now, we are not going to do formal jury instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| The rules of evidence do not apply in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| They very specifically do not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| We are not going to do formal jury instructions in the way that we do in criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| This is a civil hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| It is an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| We are not going to provide you due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| We are going to allow you to make arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| If you find that it's appropriate to argue those issues, you certainly will be allowed to argue those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| But I am not going to give a curative instruction on every issue where you find some fault with what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| with the way a case is prosecuted criminally or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| So that is my response to your request for a curative instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| Well, I wasn't trying to equivocate or argue with you what I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| Maybe you misunderstood me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| I was asking you to do that from the Tennessee pattern jury instructions civil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| which appropriately covers those same, very same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| Thank you, but no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| I'm not going to give that instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| Is there a redirect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| These beer cans that Mr. Bell asked you about, were they opened or unopened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| As best I could recall, they were unopened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Now, Mr. Bell asked you if you recorded in your report the age of Mr. Hatcher is 21 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| Yes, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| Did you do a supplement to that report to reflect the correct age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| That was a clerical error on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| I did do a supplement several days later to record the correct age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| Age of 20 years old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Age 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| No further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| Rick Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| I noticed that when I reviewed your notebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| there was not a complete inventory of everything that was found at the scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| including each and every item that was found from the wallet of the deceased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| and each and every item found within the cartilage of the automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Did you record everything, including the probability that there was a false identification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4008)|
| 1:07:00| given the history that this man had purchased beer at Pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| given the history that you knew he had been to Monterey Restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| and given the history from witnesses that he'd been seen at Michael's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| There's an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Before you answer, there's an objection that's being raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| I object on several bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| First, the question is beyond the scope of redirect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| And secondly, it's a complex question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| It involves multiple questions within itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| And thirdly, it assumes facts not in evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| I'll cure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| I don't think you're going to be able to cure the fact that it's beyond the scope of the redirect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| He asked him, did he make a correction as to the gentleman's age from 21 to 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4057)|
| 1:07:46| And he said it was based upon a miscalculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| And I think he's opened the door to the fact that there is likely a second license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| that he was reading off of that the police lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| He did not say it was a miscalculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| He said it was a clerical error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| What's the difference between a miscalculation and a clerical error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| Is that a distinction without a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Well, it is a distinct difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| A clerical error is writing something down wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| A miscalculation is different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| Or reading something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| I guess we're wondering also when it is that you're going to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4107)|
| 1:08:35| the rules of civil procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| And when you're not, when you're saying that how can we get around the proposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| that's outside the scope of what was asked on redirect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| I suggest to you that if the rules don't apply, then we ought to be allowed to reopen cross-examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4129)|
| 1:08:59| Well, that's a legitimate point for you to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| In response to that point, I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| I am not a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| I am not trained as a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| I am a hearing officer who is trying his dead level best to give everyone here a fair opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| to have a due process hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| I'm trying to use common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| I'm trying to use what little bit of legal skill I have in accomplishing that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| And along those lines, I don't think with regard to an administrative civil hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| with regard to this issue, you are necessarily entitled to those fine niceties and legal distinctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4170)|
| 1:09:38| Because of that, I am going to continue to try to provide as best I can a fair hearing for both of these parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| a due process hearing that provides a reasonable opportunity for you to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| But I may get some evidentiary rulings wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| And I'll do the best I can not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| But we are going to do our dead level best not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| And if it is the case that we make a mistake in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| then you're just going to have to take that up at the next level, which I know very well you know how to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| So I think that's the only response, Mr. Levitt, I can give you to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4208)|
| 1:10:17| Now, if you would like to ask recross-examination questions that are within the area of the scope of redirect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4217)|
| 1:10:29| it is your opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| If I understand your ruling, that series of questions that I was putting to the witnesses outside the scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4233)|
| 1:10:42| and therefore I'm not going to be permitted to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| The very long and complicated question that I heard you ask seemed to be outside that scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| But if you want to try to do it in a simpler one-question-at-a-time mode, I'll rule on them one at a time if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Let me see if I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| As an accident scene investigator, you inventoried the car completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| Objection outside the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| Well, I've got to lay a foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| I mean, it really is outside the scope of the redirect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| The redirect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Let me just get right down to the heart of the coconut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| You did all the things you're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| Did you record in there that there was a second driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Now, who else was on the scene beside you that may have done the inventory to find a second driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4297)|
| 1:11:49| that caused you to make a clerical error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| Mr. Swanson, this is outside the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| Mr. Bell asked all this stuff, and here he is trying to open this back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| Here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| I object to here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| I take back here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| I say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Mr. Bell is again trying to open all this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| He had his opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| There was a very limited redirect examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Now Mr. Bell wants to open all this stuff up again outside the scope of that redirect examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| The city objects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| Let me ask the question of who was there taking an inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| which may be a little bit outside the scope of the redirect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| But I'm not going to open the door for a whole lot of stuff that's outside the scope of the redirect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| But if you want an answer to that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| I'll let you get an answer to the question of who was there on the scene to take an inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| Please answer that, officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| That would be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Did you record everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| No, sir, I didn't record everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Getting right down to, I know I asked these same questions, but I did it in tri-part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| Let me ask you one single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| How did you determine to recalculate this gentleman's age to be 20 as opposed to age 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4394)|
| 1:13:26| Well, like I said earlier, that was a clerical error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| And I think I made that because I was thinking the kid was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| it was just such a shock in my mind that he was eight days before his 21st birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| And when I was filling out the report, I just marked it as a 21 instead of 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4420)|
| 1:13:49| And several days later, I noticed that in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| And I went back and I filed the amendment to the report, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| You filed a supplement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| I filed a supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| Will you pull the supplement out, please, and read what you reported as to how you determined that you made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4443)|
| 1:14:10| clerical error as you determined here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4450)|
| 1:14:32| I'll read exactly what I wrote, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| I wrote, correction, Knoxville Police Department, on the diagram, on a supplement report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| correction to driver number one age, report reflects 21 with date of birth 5-23-85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4482)|
| 1:14:52| Driver number one was actually 20 years of age at the time of police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| Does it show how you made a discovery of that clerical error, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| No, sir, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| Is that reported or recorded anywhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4513)|

| 1:15:16| No further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Verification questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Could you ask if Mr. Bell is going to bother putting the blowup into evidence and pass it around so we can see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| Did you intend for that to be entered into evidence, Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| Actually, it's too cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| Let me get the smaller version and mark it as exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| Mr. Swanson, there's a lot of what would be hearsay on that document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| including the item that you sustained the objection on relative to the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| I'll withdraw doing that and agree with him and just submit to the hearing officer jointly that it's a demonstrative aid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4546)|
| 1:15:54| and you can treat it as such rather than an exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| Will you please explain to them what a demonstrative aid is as opposed to a received in the evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| May I be heard on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| A demonstrative aid cannot overcome hearsay objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| He's not saying that it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| He's saying that I need to explain to them that in eliciting a witness's testimony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4573)|
| 1:16:21| sometimes you refer to documents or things that may not be admissible as evidence in order to either refresh the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4581)|
| 1:16:29| witness's recollection or to otherwise make it clear to the witness what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| And that document may not be an admissible document because of other things that are contained in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| And that is the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| That is not an admissible document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| The parties agree that it is not an admissible document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| So you will not consider everything that was on that document as evidence in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| You will not consider that document as evidence in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| You will simply consider the testimony of the witness as you heard it on the stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| as the testimony in this case supplemented by exhibits that were properly admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| As he adopted the statements in his testimony on this exhibit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| I think that's consistent with what his testimony was on the stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4636)|
| 1:17:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Call your next witness, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Mr. Swanson, next the city would like to introduce stipulated exhibit 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| which is a certified copy of the death certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| And if I could pass this on up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| May this witness come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| He may come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| The record reflect we're now four hours into the city's proof in chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| The record may reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| And based on the way this hearing has been going, we're not going to have time limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| We're going to let them put on their proof and we're going to let you put on your proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| So we're suspending the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| With regard to the time limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Don't overstate the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| Mr. Swanson, with respect to the exhibit that was just handed up, the death certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| I just want to read several of the entries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| Entry number one, the name Jonathan Frederick Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| Block three, date of death, May 15, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Block six, date of birth, May 23, 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| And block 28, immediate cause of death, cranial cerebral injuries as a result due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| or as a result of an automobile accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| Next, Mr. Swanson, the city would like to introduce stipulated exhibit 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| which is a certified copy of the official alcohol report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| May I pass this up to the fair board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| Mr. Bell's objection to that is duly noted, as we've already discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4747)|
| 1:19:17| With respect to this exhibit, I would like to point out it shows the subject is Jonathan F. Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| The date received on the specimen is May 15, 2006, at 12.45 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| The results, ethyl alcohol amount 0.18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| We would now renew our, without restating it in its entirety, request for a curative instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4777)|
| 1:19:45| and a limiting instruction as to its admissibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| Objection overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4790)|
| 1:19:58| Mr. Swanson, finally, and the city will be through with its case after I read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| I would ask that I be permitted to refer to TCA section 55-10-408,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| which specifies that eight hundredths of one percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| or more by weight of alcohol in the blood, defendant's blood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| shall create a presumption that the defendant's ability to drive was sufficiently impaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| thereby to constitute a violation of TCA section 55-10-401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| Did he accurately read it, Mr. Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| According to my recollection, I haven't looked at it in a week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| Would you like to look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| This is a good lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| If he says it's so, I believe him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| That will be received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Are you going to make a copy of that to introduce as the next number to exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| city 16, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| Tell me again the statute number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| 55-10-401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4871)|

| 1:21:17| 55-10-401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4877)|
| 1:21:33| Actually, I don't have a copy of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| I have to substitute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| City rest, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4906)|
| 1:21:52| May we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| I have about 12 minutes to confer, 12 to 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4916)|

| 1:22:12| Everybody's surprised and a lot quicker than what we planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4932)|
| 1:22:21| You want a 12-minute recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Twelve to 15, somewhere in that range, a reasonable recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| I will assure you that I will do my best to try to cut out the wheat from the chaff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=4946)|

| 1:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5051)|
| 1:24:41| Because he's marking them, but you're keeping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| Or somebody's keeping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| Okay, do you have them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| I mean, do you have the ones that were introduced tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| A couple that were up here are still circulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Where are the ones that were introduced tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| Circulating around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| The license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| There's 14, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| Last time I saw the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| And there's the license right there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| So here's a couple of them that are still up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| I probably need those for my opening statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| If I could just get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Here's 13, 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Are they going to say we totaled the pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| It was the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| The original was the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| 13, 14, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| I don't make a note of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5136)|
| 1:25:45| Oh, yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| Here's the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Multiple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| If we get a copy of that file, it's installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5160)|
| 1:26:11| We're going to do it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| Do you have an extra one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5172)|
| 1:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5202)|
| 1:27:00| Okay, it's 744.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Let's see if we can't get organized and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5223)|
| 1:27:24| Mr. Kaiser, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| The city has rested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| That's correct, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| Do we have everyone in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Under the rules that we are following that were adopted by the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| the next item after the city rest is there's an opportunity for any member of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| If any member of the beer board chooses to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| there's an opportunity at this time for the members of the beer board to move to dismiss this matter at the conclusion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| city's proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| So if anyone wishes to make the motion to dismiss this matter at the close of the city's proof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5274)|
| 1:28:02| then any member of the beer board can make that motion and the chair will entertain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| Mr. Chairman, I'm not sure that's quite correctly stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5288)|
| 1:28:21| If I understood the statement that would suggest to this board that they would be voting to dismiss the entire matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5301)|
| 1:28:35| I believe what's in front of them is whether or not to continue the suspension pending further action by the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5315)|
| 1:28:49| and or its administrative judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| That's a point that's well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| And I assume that the members of the beer board understood that that would be the motion to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| If there is a what is pending before you now is the issue of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| or not to continue the emergency suspension until such time as there is a hearing on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| So the motion to dismiss would simply be to dismiss that temporary suspension and to allow the essentially to allow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5353)|
| 1:29:21| permit to go back into effect until such time as the parties have the hearing before the hearing officer on the matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5361)|
| 1:29:29| that are brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| And, Mr. Levitt, that is accurately stated and probably should have been stated to the members of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| So if anybody wants to make that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| if any member of the beer board wants to make that motion at this point, this is the appropriate opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5379)|
| 1:29:48| Seeing none, then, because the Michaels deferred their opening statement until the opening of their proof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5388)|
| 1:29:57| I think we're now at the point where, Mr. Bell or Mr. Levitt, you may make your opening statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| For the record, if we were permitted to do so, Michaels or Knoxville Entertainment Restaurant Group Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5404)|
| 1:30:16| DBA Michaels would make a motion for legal reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5416)|
| 1:30:24| But as I understand the rules that you adopted yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| we're preempted from making such a right to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| That is accurate under the rules that we have adopted to follow in this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| That is not this is not a time when Michaels can make a motion to dismiss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| but any of the beer board may make that motion should they choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| With that in mind, then, comes Knoxville Entertainment Restaurant Group, DBA Michaels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| and would ask permission to make a brief opening statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| I know you've collapsed the time on everybody, but I'll try and be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| The rules provide for five minutes for the opening statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| and I believe the city observed those time limits and I would hope that Michaels would do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| I thought you suspended all time for the city and you were going to suspend all time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| With regard to putting on proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| Members of the board, the charging instrument, I think, as Mr. Levitt pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5483)|
| 1:31:32| the question before you is stated thusly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| The beer permit referenced above is immediately suspended pending further order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| and that such permit immediately shall be surrendered to the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| and it shall remain in full force in effect pending further orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| And that is predicated upon the allegation that it appeared to the chairman of the beer board for the city that the holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5515)|
| 1:32:04| that is, Michaels, in permit number P052098011, the holder of a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5524)|
| 1:32:13| has violated the provision of the chapter four of the city code in that the permitee served alcohol to an underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5533)|
| 1:32:26| Knoxville Police Department explorer on December 28, 2006 in violation of various sections of the city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5546)|
| 1:32:38| and Tennessee code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| And based upon the totality of the circumstances that it is necessary and appropriate for the permit to be immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5561)|
| 1:32:50| suspended pending hearings so as to avoid the danger to the health, safety, and welfare of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5570)|
| 1:33:02| That is what the question that must be decided is whether or not the city, as Mr. Swanson pointed out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5582)|
| 1:33:14| has convinced you by preponderance of the evidence that this suspension remain in effect based upon the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5594)|
| 1:33:27| that you have received thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| Now, our proof, simply put, would be very limited in scope because we plan to move the hearing officer, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5611)|
| 1:33:48| to allow us to adopt and incorporate as part of our defense all of the cross-examination of each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5628)|
| 1:33:58| and every one of the city's witnesses in our proof in chief to show that the permittee under circumstances that are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5638)|
| 1:34:17| by law did, in point of fact, serve alcohol and that there is no totality of the circumstances mandating a necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5657)|
| 1:34:35| and making it publicly appropriate for the permit to be immediately suspended pending further hearing before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5675)|
| 1:34:46| his Honor Bill Petty in April of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5686)|
| 1:34:54| The testimony that you have received and that is part of the defense proof is you have a veteran police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5694)|
| 1:35:07| with the Knoxville Police Department who every day of his professional career for 13 years looks at driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5707)|
| 1:35:21| and he made a clerical mistake in a case involving the death, a very serious investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5721)|
| 1:35:33| You contrast that with the atmosphere of a nightclub, restaurant, business, whatever name you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5733)|
| 1:35:45| that Michaels was an establishment that operated on Kingston Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5745)|
| 1:35:53| and that the city sent an undercover woman that had the appearance of a mature, as she testified yesterday and is part of our proof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5753)|
| 1:36:10| of a well-nourished, fully developed female who had a driver's license picture made the evening before the so-called sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5770)|
| 1:36:24| who gave the appearance in fact here before you as you witnessed that she was over 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5784)|
| 1:36:33| that the police department, while they may have made photographs before and after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| would not find it fit and appropriate to submit those for your consideration on the evening in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5799)|
| 1:36:47| and that the city did not think it appropriate in order to terminate the continuation of a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5807)|
| 1:36:57| think it was appropriate the biggest law enforcement agency in this community to take one tape recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5817)|
| 1:37:05| one videotape, one transmitting device to Michaels to record the totality of the circumstances regarding this young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5825)|
| 1:37:17| In point of fact, there was all proof shows and would show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| One more minute, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| One more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| That the driver's license had to be manipulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| This was a manipulated driver's license of a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| You move it to the left, you don't see the red mark, you see the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| You move it to the right, you see the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| Obviously, the focal point was the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| This young lady that was a server made the same clerical error that a trained officer made for which the city now says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5875)|
| 1:38:09| well, he made a clerical error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| We'll forgive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| But as to a business in this community, they need to lose their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5895)|
| 1:38:23| And we suggest to you that that is not a full cup of justice as demanded in a society of honest and decent people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5903)|
| 1:38:41| I would have a lot more to say, but the time does not allow me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| So I would ask for you to recall in your minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| all that that you have received on cross-examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| And that, if I were permitted to have additional time, I would say more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| But I would ask that you consider that as you consider the presentation of our proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| Thank you, Mr. Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| You may present your first witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5950)|
| 1:39:22| While my witness is coming in, I promise Ms. Sandy Mitchell and the court reporter and the members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=5962)|

| 1:40:45| Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| And where were you employed on December the 28th, 2006?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6047)|
| 1:40:58| Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| What was your position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Cocktail waitress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| Did you come into contact with a police explorer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Did you, would you tell the members of the board, just turn to them and tell in your own words what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6071)|
| 1:41:22| It was about, I guess, close to 530 or 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| The bar was pretty empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Two young ladies walked in, sat down next to the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| At this point, I realized that since it was not 9 o'clock yet, we did not have anybody at the door carding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| And even besides that fact, since they did look quite young, I carded them, took both their IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| The first one said 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| The next one, 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| Walked away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| They both ordered a drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Served them the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| They then asked for menus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| At that point, I sat down and talked to a friend of mine that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| And about ten minutes later, ABC and a couple other cops came in and asked to see me outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6122)|
| 1:42:12| And that's when I was served my citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| After you served the beverages, did the young lady who was a police explorer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6135)|
| 1:42:26| you later found out to be a police explorer, did she leave your site and go somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| I was not watching the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| I had just, you know, served them their drinks as they had asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| and was going to come check back on them to see what they had wanted to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| So at that point, I was not watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| Did you believe, what did you believe her date of birth to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Why did you believe that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| I had stared at both IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| I've worked in a bar for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| It's never happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| It's a very, you know, serious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| I made sure to look at both correctly, especially because, you know, like I said, they did look rather young to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6181)|
| 1:43:09| And that's just what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| Physically, did she appear to be her stated age of being born in 1983, that is, 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6192)|
| 1:43:22| I mean, like I said, nowadays, you know, sometimes you know, sometimes you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| But like I said, I definitely did try to look even harder just because they did look on the younger side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| especially with a Michaels crowd usually being more middle-aged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| And it being that early in the day, I did look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6215)|
| 1:43:43| Now, when the law enforcement came in, did they try to convince you that some other birthday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6223)|
| 1:43:51| 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| Tell us how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| They put my ID and another ID up on the clipboard and said this young lady's birthday is 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6236)|
| 1:44:09| And, you know, just served my citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| Did you tell them that based upon what the police were telling you her birthday was, then you obviously misread it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6253)|
| 1:44:21| That's what they were telling me, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| And so did you tell them to put that in the citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| Did you tell them to put that in the citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| I just said that what I had read was 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| Now, you were given a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| To appear on a criminal summons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| How long have you been in the serving a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6286)|
| 1:44:53| Three and a half, four years, the first time I started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| In other establishments, have you witnessed the Knoxville Police Department giving warnings to underage servers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6297)|
| 1:45:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| I have several friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Objection to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| What is the relevance to this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| It's a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| The police department said we don't give warning tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| Do you have any same warning tickets for underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| Objection to relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| Of course it's relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| It's rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| Overrule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| Are you aware of warning tickets for underage serving of alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6330)|
| 1:45:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| I have not actually physically seen the tickets, but I have friends who have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| I have personal knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| Sustained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6348)|
| 1:45:59| May I have just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| You may ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6370)|
| 1:46:29| I'm Allison Everton with the City Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| Nice to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| You, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| You just testified that you've worked in a bar for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| On the night of December 28, you admit that you served the Explorer, what she ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| And that was a Merlot wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| You stated earlier that she looked rather young to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Both girls did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| So you looked at their IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| And you testified that you stared at their IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| You took the 1977 ID and actually held it in your hand, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| But the other ID was in a wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| And you didn't take it out of that wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| You didn't ask the girl to take it out of the wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| I slipped the ID over so I could see the birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| You could see the birth date inside that plastic sleeve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Did you not also see the red 21 on the side of the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| You didn't look for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| I did look for it, and that's half the reason why I didn't take it out of the wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| So you looked for the red bar that says under 21, and you're saying you didn't see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| And it stayed in the sleeve of that ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| It stayed in the sleeve of that wallet the entire time, the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| Yes, I moved it, but I did not fully take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| But you did move it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| Back and forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| Moved it one way to see the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| Moved it the other way to see whether or not there was a red bar of a 21, under 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| When I switch it to the left, the left side is usually where the red is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| And so you moved it back and forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| You looked at the left side of the ID, where if there was an under 21, it would be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| And you moved it to the right side of the ID to see the entire birthday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| And you thought it said 1983?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Why did you think it said 1933?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| I guess because it's 1933.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Well, you said you thought the 8 was a 3, and there's two 8s in the birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6498)|
| 1:48:24| Why didn't you think it was 1933?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| That would not be a number I would think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Her being young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| So it would make more sense that it was an 8, that that first 8 was an 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| And it would make sense to actually look at the entire birthday, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| As the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| And it's your responsibility to look carefully at the IDs, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| You took a test in your AFSC class, did you not, about responsibilities of servers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| Do you recall being asked a question on your test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| As a server, you have the right and the responsibility not to serve alcohol to any person who is under a legal drinking age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| a minor, or is showing signs of intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| Do you recall that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| And you got that question right on your test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Do you recall that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| You were also asked a question on your test, asking for proper identification to determine the age of the customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| does not fulfill your responsibility as a server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| You must verify that the identification is valid and proves the customer is 21 years of age or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| Do you recall that question on the test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| And you got that question right, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| But you didn't take the ID out of the wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| You didn't ask Ms. Key to take her ID out of the wallet to show you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| Didn't fondle the ID, didn't flip it over, didn't hold the ID at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| To me, I just knew what I needed to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| You saw what you needed to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6583)|
| 1:49:53| And what you saw was 1983, not 1988?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6597)|
| 1:50:19| When you were hired to work at Michael's Restaurant, were you given an orientation packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6619)|
| 1:50:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| And you read that carefully?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| And you comply with that packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| This is outside the scope of direct, and I assume the rules apply equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| And if we kept our questions too limited that they couldn't go outside the scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6635)|
| 1:50:45| they'd run pretty far afield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| And so now we register an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| I think the direct was addressed to what care did she take in establishing that this person was of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6649)|
| 1:50:56| proper age to serve a drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| And I think this question is calculated to go to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| And so I think that's an open issue when you ask her whether or not she took care to see that this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6661)|
| 1:51:08| was of an appropriate age to serve a drink to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| And if I'm understanding her questioning correctly, this question is calculated to determine the degree of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6672)|
| 1:51:19| care she used based on the training that she has to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6679)|
| 1:51:25| I never asked her that if her care was predicated upon the degree of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| I never went into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| But I think it is necessarily implicated when you ask the questions about the degree of care she utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6694)|
| 1:51:41| And determining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| Our trouble with this ruling is, very frankly, is when we try the same thing, we get told to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6702)|
| 1:51:53| When the city gets the opportunity, they're permitted to go into wide open cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6713)|
| 1:52:01| And I would ask that you as a hearing officer make sure that the rules equally apply to both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6721)|
| 1:52:10| It's hard to get into this with the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| And you said it was outside the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| And I was limited into what I could go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| And it just doesn't seem right or fair that as the hearing progresses, as they say in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6740)|
| 1:52:30| they keep moving the goalposts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| And I would register an objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| And I would like to have knowledge as to what rule is going to be the standard and consistently applied in this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6754)|
| 1:52:44| And I think Mr. Leavitt would likewise join in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| Objection overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| You may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| I asked you about a training packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| You received that training packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| And it's an orientation packet for workers at Michaels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| And you've read that packet thoroughly and follow the rules of Michaels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Does it actually train you that you're not supposed to serve employees under the age of 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| Very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| And, I'm sorry, customers under the age of 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| Yet you are supposed to be aware of your customers' needs, are you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| I'm going to read a portion of the packet and see if that's familiar to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| Deadbeat customers will tie up one of your tables all night if you do not kill them with kindness and hawk them to buy the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6799)|
| 1:53:27| Although it is more fulfilling to sell cocktails to big tippers, it is also the server's job to make freeloaders as uncomfortable as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| Do not give up simply saying they're not drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| Are you familiar with that clause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| There's an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| I need to take the objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| We object to that question as being put to this witness as outside the scope of direct examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6821)|
| 1:53:54| It's not relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| Even if it is relevant, it does not meet the criteria of being probative under Rule 403 and that the prejudicial effect is substantially outweighed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6836)|
| 1:54:10| by any probative value that could be elicited from the question and the response of the witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6850)|
| 1:54:19| Overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| Are you familiar with that clause of the employee packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| I read it three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| You know, small different things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Do I need to show you the copy of the employee packet on page one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| No, I listened to what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| And is that in the employee packet that you were provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| And you comply with Michael's guidelines as you just testified earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| Re-direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| I thought that we were letting the council ask members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| Not until you all are completely finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| I'm concluding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| Are there any clarifying questions from the members of the council, of their board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6908)|
| 1:55:18| The question that we're being asked is, is the policy that you read from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| are you offering that as an exhibit in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| or are you just utilizing that in her cross-examination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6926)|
| 1:55:34| We certainly are happy to give you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| My copy that I have down here is marked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| so I don't know if it's appropriate to provide the board a highlighted version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| but we certainly can give you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| I object to this as an exhibit for the same grounds that I objected before as to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6943)|
| 1:55:51| Well, it really wasn't introduced as an exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| It wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| The proper foundation wasn't laid for it to be introduced as an exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| And so the answer to the question is no, it's not being offered as an exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| She was interrupted while it was being read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| Would it be appropriate for her to be able to read it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| She claimed to have understood the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| So I think she offered an answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| So I don't believe it would be appropriate to ask the question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6978)|
| 1:56:25| That's the nature of a hearing like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Sometimes you get interrupted with an objection and it's up to the lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| and the witness to determine whether the question was understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| And if the question is understood, then appropriately answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| And I think we had a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| We had an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| We had then a renewal of that question and an answer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| So I think it's properly before you at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| Is there anything else from any of the beer board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| Seeing nothing, you may call your next witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| If I could just be excused to return to our normal duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| Counsel, is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7022)|
| 1:57:12| I think it's premature to release her until we see what the rest of their case is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| Counsel to the outside, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070117michaelshearingd4?start=7036)|
