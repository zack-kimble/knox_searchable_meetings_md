| 0:10:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| First item on the agenda is item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| Applicant is Taylor D. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Location is north side of Delrose Drive, south side of Brooks Avenue, west of Riverside Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| Approximate size of the tract is 29.71 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| Present plan and zoning designation is low-density residential, hillside protection, R-N-1, hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| Proposed plan designation is hillside protection, medium-density residential office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| Existing land use, agriculture, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| Staff recommendation on the first motion would be approve medium-density residential land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| because it is consistent with changing conditions in the area and the hillside protection would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| The second staff recommendation is approve the medium-density residential land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=712)|
| 0:12:04| because it is consistent with the changing conditions in the area and hillside protection would be retained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| and that would be related to the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| The third motion related to rezoning would be a staff recommendation is approve the R-N-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=733)|
| 0:12:21| general residential neighborhood district because it is consistent with changing conditions in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| and is more compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Hillside protection overlay would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| Do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Is Ms. Buffalo here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Would you want to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| I'd like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| Here on behalf of the property owner on these three requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| initially when we filed these requests for the sector plan and one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| we were seeking MDRO, medium-density residential office, and a rezoning to the R-N-6 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=793)|
| 0:13:22| After receiving the staff report and recommendation and having discussions with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| we found that the report and the recommendations were reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| and agreed to amend our request for the sector plan and the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| just to the medium-density residential as well as the rezoning to the lesser zoning of R-N-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=816)|
| 0:13:44| As noted, this area, the East City Sector Plan area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| has seen a significant change over the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| a significant increase in residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| and kind of intensity or desire to develop residential developments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| This is supported by the fact of the recent groundbreaking of the multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| that's in close proximity to the site of the Riverside at Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| That development, again, a recent groundbreaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| and it's adjacent to an existing multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| This area offers as support for these amendments and rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| are the community assets that are present in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| This includes the East Knox County Greenway Trail, which is scheduled to be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| There's also the Knoxville Botanical Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| The Greenway Trail will be extended to the east to connect with the Knoxville Botanical Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| There's also the Williams Creek Golf Course, also known as the Wii Course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| which is adjacent to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| In addition, there's the Sarah Moore Green Magnet Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| as well as a CAT bus terminal at that school location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| And from the property to that bus terminal, it's served by sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Again, all these making this property in this area prime for development and attractive for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| They are in for zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| It balances the need for available housing, not only in Knoxville, Knox County, but in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| It will assist, rezoning the property R and 4 will assist in meeting that unmet demand for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| but also the R and 4, based on the type of housing that's allowed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| will also create the opportunity to meet the unmet demand of the variety of housing that we're missing right now in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=938)|
| 0:15:48| So we ask that you approve the sector plan amendment to medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| the one year plan amendment to medium density residential, and rezone the property recommendation to R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=953)|
| 0:16:01| and follow staff's recommendations. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you, Counselor. Miss Buffalo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I'd say one more thing. Sorry. I've been in communication with Al Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| He lives in close proximity to the property. He's got several properties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| We've had a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| He is also involved with the Williams Creek Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| He's on the board there and oversees the youth development program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| So, Mr. Gibbs and I had a great discussion and talking about the future of this proposed development and keeping the lines of communication open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=989)|
| 0:16:40| I know he is in discussions with several property owners in that area and seeing a way to work together and offer some benefit for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| I appreciate him reaching out. Again, that was a great conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| We'll keep that line of communication open. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you. Miss Buffalo, if you'd state your name and address, please, when you approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1016)|
| 0:17:06| My name is Karina Buffalo, and I have lived at 2701 Delrose Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee, since 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1026)|
| 0:17:14| I will probably have to just throw this away because I did not know until five minutes before we started that there had been some changes to the proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1034)|
| 0:17:24| So, I want to thank commission. I personally am thrilled about our info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| Miss Buffalo, pardon the interruption. Could you pull that microphone a little closer to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| Oh, I'm sorry. I can hear some rumblings in the audience there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| Is that better? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Okay. I want to thank commission for the proposed zoning of RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| I feel like there is a drought in Knoxville for, like, triplexes, duplexes, and I think it would be awesome to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1069)|
| 0:18:01| and maybe some assisted living facilities for the aging part of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| And I feel like that could all be kind of balanced in something over that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| So, I'm really kind of thrilled, so thank you all very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| I had submitted online a photo of my front yard with a lot of water in it because there is an extensive amount of runoff from 2805.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1098)|
| 0:18:31| And I didn't even realize how high that is until we got the snow that stayed and I could see the elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| Okay, that's why that water runs into my yard and fills it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| So, I would like for you guys or engineering or whoever does to, if you can, please address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1124)|
| 0:18:55| because I did not realize it is also occurring across the street behind the houses on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| You just don't see it because it runs behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| It also runs further down and floods yards that are covered with trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| And I cannot imagine with the amount of paving that this would cause where all that water would go that lands on 2805.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1148)|
| 0:19:19| So, if you all would just consider that and contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| The only other thing that I can say is I walked in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| I asked as many neighbors as I could find home as soon as I knew that this was a deal, what their concern was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| And they said crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| And I think that is largely due to packing a whole bunch of people who don't know each other into a small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| And I think you've addressed that with our N4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| So, there again, I thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| But I do ask that you help us with our stormwater situation before any paving is done, if you all can help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1199)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1216)|
| 0:20:27| Commissioner Schell, so what would be the stormwater analysis step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| Or when would that be analyzed in a large development like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| Our colleagues in engineering might want to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| City engineering, but during when they submit for their development plan review for the permitting process and the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| They calculate it all then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1251)|
| 0:20:59| But I think that should. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1259)|
| 0:21:12| Sorry about that. Joshua phrase city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Typically, when a site like this is developed, they'll have to make sure that the runoff from the site after the development is no greater than what it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1276)|
| 0:21:28| They'll also have to study the downstream receiving system to make sure it's adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| If not, then oftentimes we'll either ask them to improve or maintain that system or provide some additional mitigation on site to offset, help correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1294)|
| 0:21:50| If they make any improvements to the streets, they have to meet our stormwater ordinance and prevent flooding from, at a minimum, a 25 year storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1310)|
| 0:22:05| But that depends on the classification of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| Additionally, I think the RN4 fits kind of where this is, considering it's adjacent to some RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| And we did some numbers at agenda review on the potential impact of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| So I think I think this is reasonable. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| Commissioner Higgins. I agree with Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| And with that, I'd like to make a motion. So I know this has three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| So bear with me. I'll start with make a motion to change the East City Sector Plan from LDR to MDR O and hillside protection HP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1361)|

| 0:23:02| I'm sorry. Oh, just MDR. Just MDR. No O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| Corrected second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| OK, we have a motion by Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Adams to approve the the sector plan for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1394)|
| 0:23:26| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1406)|

| 0:23:55| Related to the one year plan, approve the MDR land use classification per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1443)|

| 0:24:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Adams to approve R and four per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1465)|

| 0:25:30| Here on behalf of the applicant, property owner Maple Lane Homes, as many of you may recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| we were here in November on a sector plan amendment and one year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| which resulted in a down, I guess, an amendment downwards from what had previously been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| This parcel was was carved off from the church there to the north and then acquired by my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| So what we're here asking today is for a special use improvement for a two family dwelling unit to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1557)|
| 0:26:06| Two family dwelling units are permitted in the R and one zone subject to the approval of planning commission of a special special use request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1566)|
| 0:26:18| Included in the in the application and in your packet is the site plan for the development, the elevations and the renderings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1578)|
| 0:26:26| The site plan designates location of the develop the dwelling unit development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| It's in line with the other residents that are on that street as far as kind of the setbacks and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| Everything kind of kind of aligns there to where to where it mimics what's already been developed on West Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1600)|
| 0:26:50| The dwelling units will consist of each two story units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| There'll be three bedroom units, two and a half baths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| They'll have parking, a garage for each unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| Access will be from West Ridge Drive, have patio deck on the on the back of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| These these units will be perfect for people with with families looking for housing in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1633)|
| 0:27:22| This area is close proximity to West Hills Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| There are several parks, several other community, community assets, churches and in close proximity to the 40 interchange there at West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1646)|
| 0:27:38| Kingston Pike, the commercial corridor there, as well as as Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| The one year plan, and that's one of the basis for staff support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| It provides that two family dwellings may be permitted in low density residential areas like this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| where other development will not significantly affect the service demands or aesthetics of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| Now, this is just one lot, two dwelling units, and it's a sizable lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| It's close to 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| The development of this two family dwelling is not going to impact the services in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| It's not going to be a detriment or to the aesthetics or devalue the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| It's new construction and the renderings. It's a very good looking, good, good looking dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1703)|
| 0:28:32| The opposition, there's been some comments on on the Planning Commission website related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| This this request and those comments sent around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| They don't want a two family dwelling unit or duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| And that's that's period. There's no there's no real basis or justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| It's just, you know, conclusory statements that aren't supported by any kind of factual factual statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1729)|
| 0:28:57| factual variants of any any sort to to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| This area is a popular area. This area doesn't have a ton of new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| which we'd submit that new construction in this area is a good thing, brings up property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| This street, the interesting thing about this street is less than 450 feet away to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| There is already an existing single family house on a lot that that has a duplex as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| So you have three units on on this one lot that's approximately 450 feet to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| And then immediately adjacent to us on the east, although not a not a duplex or two family dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| You can see there there's a single family house and then a whether it's a guest house, a mother in law suite of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| But it is a different registered addressed house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| So, you know, this request for this two family dwelling units in character with the community, it's in character with the immediate street, isn't going to be an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1795)|
| 0:30:05| It's it's in harmony with the area and will be a benefit, not a detriment to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| We'd ask that you follow staff's recommendation and approve the special use request for a two family dwelling on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| Thank you. Thank you. Is Matt Davis on our list in opposition like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1816)|
| 0:30:36| Good afternoon. Matt Davis, 7405 Westridge Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1836)|
| 0:30:44| I'm going to do my best to stick to my script here so I can move through it pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| So I'm here today as a resident of Westridge to dissuade the planning commission from approving this request to build a duplex or a two family dwelling on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1849)|
| 0:31:01| And in question here. So my personal reason for opposing this request is because I feel strongly that this development goes against the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1861)|
| 0:31:16| It's there's a lot of old houses. New construction does not fit that aesthetic, as he was mentioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| The appeal of West Hills for my family when we moved here was that of community and establishing roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| You know, we can foresee ourselves being in in our home for the rest of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| And to me, a duplex or a two family dwelling does not fit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| It does not embody that spirit, especially not in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| And of course, if you talk to all the neighbors, you'll get different reasons why each one has their strong feeling in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| But it is a unified front that we all oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| So earlier this week, a petition was submitted to the commission that that we just decided we would go out and perform just to demonstrate the voice of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1927)|
| 0:32:20| The support was resounding. We gained 67 signatures, 41 of which are on Westridge Drive alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1940)|
| 0:32:35| And, you know, that's so much more of a louder voice than I could convey to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| While I sit back here, I counted there's roughly about 80 people in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| And I guess you guys could imagine if I brought 67 other people down here to fill up this auditorium, how how much of a presence that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1965)|
| 0:32:57| There's also an issue I want to mention. It's an issue of misrepresentation on behalf of Maple Lane Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1977)|
| 0:33:07| The special use report and the letter that Taylor DeForster had submitted to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| So they've been citing this duplex or a two family dwelling that is at 7439 Westridge Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=1994)|
| 0:33:23| They've been signing it as Exhibit A. This is not a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| It is not a two family dwelling. There's two separate structures, two separate addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| There's one tenant in each location. And this was all confirmed to me when the owner of the property signed our petition opposing this duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2016)|
| 0:33:51| So the misrepresentation is nobody's doing their due diligence to confirm that there's truly something already present on the street when it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2031)|
| 0:34:06| They are trying any means necessary to get this approved. And this is not in line with the character of our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| This duplex is not in line with the character of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| Let me just state that we gladly welcome a single family residence, a home being built at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| This development is not an investment in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| This is solely for monetary means. I'm asking this commission to not let this plea fall on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2071)|
| 0:34:41| I'm asking you to deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| 67 signatures local. And then we have the support of the West Hills Community Association as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| And I have this petition in case it did not go through to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| That's all I have. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Let's see. Next to speak would be Dale Brotherton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2104)|
| 0:35:16| I live across the street. I've lived there for 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| My name is Dale Brotherton. And this kind of makes me angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| I have a degree in architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| And this house across the street that they were proposing, have you all looked at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| I mean, have you looked at the actual elevation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| It looks like something the Jetsons would live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| It's got these, you know, roofs that come up like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| They call them scallion roofs in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| And he uses a house down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| He said there's three on one lot. Well, actually, there's only two on one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| In the other house that's in the back, it used to be a barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Actually, these two original houses that he's talking about were the original houses in Benosdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| before Benosdale Gardens, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| But Benosdale Gardens is actually what this is before there was West Hills back in the 40s and early 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| And they're a little cottage-style house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| And you actually have the dimensions somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| The little one he's talking about he thinks is a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| The reason he thinks it's a duplex is because it has a little upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| It was originally a one-car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| It's 19 by 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| And it has the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| You know, they built it up with a little four-foot wall and a little roof over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| so it would have like a little sleeping loft upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| It has a deck, a door, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| And, you know, he just, for some reason, they assumed that's a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| Well, it's not a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| And then there's the other little barn in the back that have like a shed roof on it that they changed into a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2204)|
| 0:36:53| That's what he's using as an example of the style that they're trying to make look like the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2213)|
| 0:37:02| It couldn't be any different than the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| And it's really kind of aggravating that they, you know, they want to build this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| It doesn't look anything at all like the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| I'm sure a lot of you guys know what West Hills looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| It's mostly ranchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| And on that side of the road, I got to hurry, I guess, because you guys don't give me much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| But a lot of it, you know, his letters from the lawyer and all that, they talk about it's a large lot and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2244)|
| 0:37:35| And it says here in the second section, it's supposed to be a development of single-family homes, relatively large lots with generous setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2255)|
| 0:37:45| Well, you know, all the lots on that side of the street, they kind of vary because there originally were two-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| But they've all been subdivided except for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| But we still have, I think, three, four over an acre, some of them over two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| But, you know, you average all the lots out on that street, and it comes to 127 foot per lot for the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| Well, this lot that they're trying to build this 60-foot condo or duplex on is 80 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2289)|
| 0:38:17| And it barely meets the requirement for the square footage for a two-story building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| The building that they're proposing for that, the way they're siting it is they raised it up because there's water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2303)|
| 0:38:32| You see that road coming down from the development across the street where there's four houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Well, the water comes down that road, crosses over this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| It's got a little swell in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Well, they built it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| They're going to build it up, and they have the garages in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| So they're going to try to keep the water from running down that hill into the garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| But they're going to build it up, which is going to make it a lot different than all the other lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| because all the other lots on that side, which, you know, they didn't change the grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| They just built the basement ranchers, and there's a couple of split foyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2339)|
| 0:39:11| So they're building theirs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| So it's going to set it up on this little pedestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| where everything else is just one story, you know, with the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| And so it's going to be another 10 feet higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| And one thing, another deceptive thing they did, and they looked like these drawings that they submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| were like from a, you know, they just took a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Mr. Brotherton, if you could wrap up, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| I've already overextended the opposition's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| Well, they don't show the foundation, and it's going to be like eight or nine foot high in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| I mean, because the lot slopes quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| And from the road to the back of this building, there's like a nine-foot differential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| And they don't show any of that in their drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| So, and the height will be 35 feet, which is the limit on how much-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| In other words, they're just building too big a building on too small of a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| I just think it's insane myself, and I actually have some expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| So you guys can either, you know, go with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| You can go with the people who live there in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| I mean, it's up to you, I guess, but-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Brotherton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| I did a lot of walking around the neighborhood, and everybody signed in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| except for one person who said he couldn't sign because of his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| And everybody was enthusiastic about signing it, and nobody wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| I think you have effectively communicated your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Mr. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Is Mr. Hume available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Is Mr. Lee Hume here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| I don't see Mr. Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Mr. Forrester, if you need a couple extra minutes, you're welcome to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| I've overextended the time here while I was focused on other matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Then we'll take it to commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2478)|
| 0:41:29| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| I understand the concerns of how much this may or may not fit in with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| but I think it is appropriate here, especially with the surrounding context of there being a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2502)|
| 0:41:51| a church right up against it, this being so close to the interstate and a lot of different services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| So higher density in areas like this make more sense, and this is by no means high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| And really, a duplex is just two single-family homes that are closer together than what you would normally have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| So I think that it is appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| I think it meets the criteria for use on review, and I think that it fits, and I think staff has it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2535)|
| 0:42:24| So I'll make a motion to approve per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| We have a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| and we still have some more discussion to go here, so let's go with Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| I was just going to add that when you look at the footprint of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| it's not that out of line with the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| If the exact same footprint of this building was only one unit, it wouldn't be that different than any other building, the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2571)|
| 0:43:01| So I think the scale of it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| There's nothing about a traditionally single-family residential neighborhood that makes duplexes not fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2585)|
| 0:43:13| I mean, duplexes are low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| So I don't really agree with the argument that because there aren't many, there shouldn't be any, because they are low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| So I think this one works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| Yeah, I would echo all the sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| I mean, I think it's a good fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| Now, I also commend West Hills and the folks over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| I mean, I know it's a tremendous amount of work getting 60 signatures and walking and talking through that with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| And there's always differing opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| But this isn't like the missing middle situation that got passed recently for inside the 640 loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| It's just an infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| But I would agree with Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| I mean, you're just a few hundred feet away from Osdale, which there's a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| I mean, you've got West Hill School within walking distance or sidewalks up and down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| Then you get into Bearden Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| There's a lot of reasons that it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| So I will be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I agree with everything Commissioner Huber just mentioned, missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| It's not the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| However, if there was a missing middle policy out in this area, it would have design guidelines that would make it even stricter in terms of how this type of use would conform to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2677)|
| 0:44:51| So that's just something for kind of the back burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| I especially appreciate Commissioner Stelza's comment about the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| It's two homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| They're closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| But the footprint is exactly the same as you would have in a single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| And that helped me because one thing I was getting hung up on from looking at the elevation was the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| And would the height make this structure seem different than the others around it, like a sore thumb sort of scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2718)|
| 0:45:27| Because anyone can move in and build what they wish in their own style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| But that is the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Like, this could be any single family dwelling, and it could have that height, and we wouldn't be here talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| So for those reasons, in addition to the other things said, I'm in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| So we have a seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Motion and a second to approve for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2760)|
| 0:46:08| Next is agenda item number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| The applicant, Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| This is a requested street name change from Old Tazewell Pike to Memory Hill Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2775)|
| 0:46:25| location between Murphy Road and .70 feet north of the southeast corner of parcel 039257.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2785)|
| 0:46:35| Applicants reasoned for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Part of Old Tazewell Pike was closed, which caused the right-of-way to be disconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| Having non-contiguous road segments with the street name is a safety concern for the Knox County Emergency Communications District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2802)|
| 0:46:50| The enclosed map highlights this disconnection and shows the section of Old Tazewell Pike to be renamed in Exhibit C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| Staff recommendation is to approve the name change from Old Tazewell Pike to Memory Hill Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| as requested by Addressing Department of Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2823)|
| 0:47:26| Is Mr. Murphy here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2846)|
| 0:47:40| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| You may speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| The residents, I guess there was a voting process that went on, so they did poll the residents along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| I did send in a letter, though, and provide some information to staff prior to this to give you some of the context of the section of Old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| The area has been known as Corinth since about the 1870s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| There was an old chapel on a 90-degree bend of Luttrell Road on the backside of the Murphy Farm that was Murphy Chapel Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2888)|
| 0:48:16| After the Civil War, there was a congregational split that actually occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| Some of the congregation formed a second Methodist Church, which is still standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| That's what's now Comforter Church on Old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| The reason I wrote in is I do think it's important when we're considering name changes to have some of the historical context of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| Memory Hill Lane, I don't know where that comes from personally, but if there was a name considered that had Corinth in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| that would at least provide some recognition of the historical community that lived there of Corinth and of Corinth Methodist Church, which was founded in the 1870s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2926)|
| 0:48:58| I just want to let you know that before you consider this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2938)|
| 0:49:10| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| Ms. Kupfer, would you like to comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| Certainly. Staff did reach out to the residents abutting the area of the right-of-way closure to be renamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2961)|
| 0:49:30| We sent three different rounds of letters asking for input, and Corinth Church was on each of those three letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| We did take the suggestion that Mr. Murphy had provided at the start of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| Upon the third round of voting, however, the name Memory Hill was selected as the majority vote by the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| And so that was the name that staff used for the application for the name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2991)|
| 0:49:59| All right. What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| And again, I think just sometimes you have to have some levity in these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| Having grown up in that area and traveled that, I used to use old Tazewell Pike just to get around the red light going to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| So I wish we could just find a way to call it, you know, antique Tazewell Pike, really old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| Just don't lose the Tazewell Pike because, again, as Mr. Murphy said, it just got historical context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| Memory Hill Lane sounds like we're heading towards an old person's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| So just my two cents for what it's worth there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| What's wrong with old people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| I didn't say old people. I said an old folks home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| What's wrong with an old folks home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Nothing's wrong with an old folks home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| It's just they usually, those types of homes are very forgetful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| And I don't want people to forget what's going on in the community there and our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| So listen here, you're going to sit there and debate me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| We'll go round and round there, Senior Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| But again, I just, I don't know if it's taking, I understand that they polled the people immediately around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3070)|
| 0:51:19| I don't know if it took the greater context of the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| I live right off of Murphy Road in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| So having driven that, I just hate to see old Tazewell Pike just become a little nub of what's left of what used to be that stretch of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3085)|
| 0:51:36| So I don't care either way what the commission decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| I just don't necessarily like Memory Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| I have a question for staff about, I was looking at the map and where this is, well actually go back to the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| There at the top it stops and then it seems like this road continues with maybe the same name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| What's happened, is that just drawn strange or will there be a point on this piece that turns back to old Tazewell Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3123)|
| 0:52:14| Yes, old Tazewell Pike remains north of, I think it's Luttrell is the northern portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| There was a disconnection that was created with the right-of-way closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| And so we didn't want to split the name old Tazewell Pike because that's a concern for emergency responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3147)|
| 0:52:36| And so old Tazewell Pike is not being lost as a name in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| It still remains, it's just the section of it at the southern end, the south portion of the right-of-way closure that we're changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3162)|
| 0:52:52| So the portion directly below Luttrell will remain, that small strip will remain old Tazewell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3172)|
| 0:53:02| No, that portion was closed there where it says old Tazewell Pike right-of-way closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| So that's what created the disconnection. So everything north of that point will remain old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| It's just that area highlighted in yellow that is up for the name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3192)|
| 0:53:21| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| I was reading in the case file where it appears like the December 4th survey that was sent around to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3204)|
| 0:53:38| Is that what the public actually received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| They actually received four rounds of letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| We just didn't include all that with the paperwork when we submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| We reached out to them initially on September 26th, and that letter included three options of names, Jim Tublin, Corinth Church, and Samuel Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3230)|
| 0:54:02| We reached out again November 1st, also with Corinth Church, Samuel Havis, and a suggested name that we received of World Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3242)|
| 0:54:11| Then after receiving additional responses, the final letter is what you see with December 4th with the two that had the most votes, Corinth Church and Memory Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3251)|
| 0:54:22| Where did the name Corinth Church Street or Road come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3262)|
| 0:54:30| That was provided by Mr. Murphy when we reached out to our staff historic planner for any information that she might have related to potential names in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3270)|
| 0:54:42| He had provided three different options for us, and that was what we included in the first round of letters to the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3282)|
| 0:54:50| Is he also a resident of this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| He is not one of the owners that abuts the street name change area, so he would not have an opportunity to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3292)|
| 0:55:02| So that's how resident is defined in option two, which is defined as someone—this was suggested by a resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3302)|
| 0:55:10| Correct. It was suggested by a community member as a potential name, but the voting parties are just those owners that abut the area of the street that is slated for the name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3310)|
| 0:55:24| Okay. I thought I was tracking you, but when you answered—here's my question, and I'm getting into some psychology here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3324)|
| 0:55:39| Personally, I think having a historical component there is more compelling than something that doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3339)|
| 0:55:48| But if I'm a resident and I'm being given this to vote, and I'm being told that one of my fellow residents has suggested this name, then I may be more compelled to think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3348)|
| 0:55:58| well, maybe I should vote for that because my fellow residents suggested this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| And so it seems like you're telling me that someone suggested this. They may or may not have been able to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3362)|
| 0:56:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| And that is the same case as the Corinth Church Street name, that it was suggested by a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| But we included that in the letters for the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| Oh, so what I'm reading here is not what—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| Well, the letter in the packet is the fourth letter that we received—sorry, the third letter that we sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3383)|
| 0:56:31| There were three other—two other rounds, three total letters, two other rounds prior to this that included Corinth Church as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3391)|
| 0:56:40| And is it normal to include that many rounds of voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| It just depends on the number of—how many responses we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| We're trying to obtain a majority vote, and this happened to be a very difficult process, getting neighbors to just respond at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3408)|
| 0:56:57| And then we kept receiving additional suggestions of names, and we thought it was our duty to provide more options to the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3417)|
| 0:57:06| Okay. Thanks for answering. We don't do this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| No, I understand. Yeah, that's okay. I don't do it often either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| This is kind of tough because I'm compelled for the historical name, but it seems like the community is voting otherwise, so it's a little difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3435)|
| 0:57:27| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| So Memory Hill Lane was brought in on the third solicitation of rounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3451)|
| 0:57:39| It was a suggestion after the second round of letters, and so that's why we submitted a third round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3459)|
| 0:57:50| We had been in a tie, and so we needed another round to break the tie, and since this was another suggestion, it was included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3470)|
| 0:57:59| I don't particularly care for Memory Hill Lane, so I think we should—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| I won't make any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| I think we should just not do that and name it whatever, Corinth Hill Church Road. Yeah, that sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| Since it was already in consideration, I assume that's an okay name that staff has reviewed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3502)|
| 0:58:30| Yes, it's not a duplication of any other existing street names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| I will just add that other street name change processes that have been submitted by staff for safety reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3515)|
| 0:58:46| we have always followed the process of reaching out via letter for input from the owners and not deviated from their preferred name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3526)|
| 0:58:58| I will make a motion to approve the name change to Corinth Church Street or Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3538)|
| 0:59:09| Let me—sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| We realized that it's going to be a dead-end road, so the road type would actually be Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| We corrected that on our application, but it wasn't in the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| Okay, my motion is to move to approve the name change to Corinth Church Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| I will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3567)|
| 0:59:35| Okay, so we've got a motion by Commissioner Schelso to change the name to Corinth Church Lane, seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3575)|
| 0:59:53| Seeing no other lights, any other comments, concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| Director Brooks, you want to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3608)|
| 1:00:19| All right, agenda item 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| Applicant is Robert Gregory, Gregory Land Development, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| Location, south side of High School Road, northwest of West Copeland Drive, 34.61 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| Present plan designation and zoning is agricultural, low-density residential, hillside protection, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3636)|
| 1:00:45| Proposed land designation and zoning is low-density residential, hillside protection, and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3645)|
| 1:00:54| Existing land use is agricultural, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| Staff recommendation is to approve low-density residential land use classification for the agricultural designated portion of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3659)|
| 1:01:10| because it is compatible with surrounding development and is an extension of the classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| Hillside protection designation would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| Second motion would be, recommendation would be to approve the planned residential zone with up to two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3679)|
| 1:01:28| because it's consistent with the recommended LDR land use and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| I am Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Please proceed, Councilor Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Again, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| I appreciate staff's work on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| They are recommending the sector plan amendment, which we are in agreement with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| and they are recommending a rezoning to planned residential, which we are also in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| The only issue for today's consideration, I believe, is the appropriate density for that planned residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| This is in the rural area of the current growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| It is about, as you drive south on High School Road, about 3,017 feet south of the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3738)|
| 1:02:27| Under the current growth policy plan, Section 3.5, extensions of density of one to three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3747)|
| 1:02:37| shall be considered if certain conditions are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| We believe that the record will reflect that these conditions are in place for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| The first condition is that it be zoned planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| which everyone, staff, and the applicant are in agreement that it should be zoned planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| So that condition has been satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| The second is that it have access to water and sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| which this property is served by water and sewer by the Hullsdale Powell Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| So that condition has also been satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| The next two conditions are really situated around the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| and in order under the current growth policy plan to have a consideration of up to three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| you have to submit a traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| which we did in this case by Robert Jackson, AJAX Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| That traffic impact analysis has been reviewed by planning staff and Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| and they didn't find that there were any conditions on High School Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| which is a 21-foot road, and that's kind of an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| It goes between the property and to the planned growth area anywhere between 20 and 23 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| An average of 21, I think, is what the staff's report says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| It's within a 50-foot right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| but there were no conditions that were noted in the traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| and that would indicate that any improvements needed to be made on High School Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| to manage the traffic that is anticipated from this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| And I think that's important because those are the final considerations for density to be from two units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3844)|
| 1:04:11| to three units an acre in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| And I haven't seen anything in the staff's report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| or any of the comments during the agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| that would indicate any disagreement with the findings of that traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| And under 3.5, the current growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| it certainly says the intent of this section is to allow extensions of low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| into rural areas when urban services, sanitary, sewer, water, and adequate roads become available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| which are satisfied here in this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| The property is in the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| but as staff noted, and I think I've submitted some photographs in the letter that I sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| quite a bit of the area has been previously disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| It was used as a borrow pit when the curb was being developed two and a half miles south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| and so quite a bit of that hillside area has already been disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| And our concept plan, which is, again, required as part of the traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| to have a concept, at least rough concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| We have proposed 103 units, which is 2.9 units an acre, within that area of the disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| It will fit neatly within that area so we can avoid the other parts of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| that have steep slopes on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| We are looking at doing a townhome, kind of missing middle housing form development within that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3929)|
| 1:05:37| and the planned residential zone would allow us that kind of flexibility to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| within the three units an acre that we are requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| So, again, the conditions of the current growth policy plan have been satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| There was a comment from staff at Tuesday's agenda review meeting that noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| that the proposed growth policy plan would limit this to two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| That's one of the compromises in the process that in the rural areas you're only allowed two units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| when you have this infrastructure, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| A lot of work has gone into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| We don't know where that process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| I think everybody hopes that it will ultimately be passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| but right now we're dealing with the existing growth policy plan and the current standards are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| Tennessee case law would inform us, and I'm referring specifically to the case of McAllen v. City of Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| in making land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| While this body has a lot of discretion, we have to exercise that discretion within existing policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3990)|
| 1:06:37| So we would respectfully think this property is appropriate for three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| It will help address a little bit more density in the area where the infrastructure can handle it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| and help catch up on the housing stock issues that we're having in the county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| I really appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Yeah, I think he makes a good point about the new land use plan that everybody's worked so hard on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4020)|
| 1:07:09| I've got a lot of respect for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| I know it's been in the process for several years, and I like the direction of it, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| It gives us a little more boundary to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| However, that said, it's not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| It's kind of hard to hang your hat on some things that may be changed between now and the final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4043)|
| 1:07:32| I look at this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| I'm very familiar with Emory Road, that new Kroger up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| There's just a tremendous amount of commercial activity on West Emory Road on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4057)|
| 1:07:47| Aubrey's is up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| I understand that's probably one of the highest-grossing restaurants in his entire stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| which just means there's a tremendous amount of demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| This property clearly has had land disturbance on it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| To build the Kroger, we talked about on the old airstrip that once was on Emory Road over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| That being said, I'd like to go ahead and make a motion to approve the LDR land use classification for the agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4088)|
| 1:08:16| designated portion of the parcel because it is compatible with surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| and an extension of this classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| We have a motion to approve the LDR land use classification per staff recommendation by Commissioner Huber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4106)|
| 1:08:35| seconded by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| Commissioner Higgins has his light on, so let's go to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| I agree with Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| I was just going to add that when we get to the motion regarding the density, the number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| I think that on a site that has already been disturbed, it's more appropriate for us to try to utilize that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4134)|
| 1:09:03| If it's, again, already been disturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| I would much rather those extra 30 units or so go here rather than an adjacent site that's got a thick forest on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4145)|
| 1:09:13| and would have to come down to make way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| So I'll be supporting that after this vote as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| I just wanted to ask staff if there was any rationale aside from the future kind of change to plans to support the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4162)|
| 1:09:30| dwelling units in Acre versus three, if there were any concerns that were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| I'll turn it over to Samuel in just a minute, but I want to maybe clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| So when you look at the staff report and you look at the rationale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| I know we have been talking a lot about the draft comprehensive plan and the draft growth policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4181)|
| 1:09:49| but our recommendation is not based off of those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| Just want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Do you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| I just wanted to say that the staff report is not written based on the proposed ongoing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| and it also takes into consideration the maximum allowable density by the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| which is in Exhibit B of this package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| I agree with everything that Commissioner Higgins has said and Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| Can someone point to me where in the case file we have more commitment than council's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4228)|
| 1:10:38| which I appreciate, about only disturbing the already disturbed area, or is that just good faith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4238)|
| 1:10:50| This is really a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| I know what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| I can answer the question because it is in staff's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| There's a single condition on the rezoning that the development site should be confined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| with a disturbed portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| And we're fine with that condition, just with the additional density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| I want to clarify that that condition was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| Upon looking at the aerial views more thoroughly, it looked like the whole area was disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| at some point in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| The grading work wasn't done, but if you turn on the 360 view, you'd see that the vegetation was disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| But it would be within the purview of this commission to add a condition to limit the disturbance within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| This may be why I'm struggling to see it, if it's been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4295)|
| 1:11:43| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| I don't feel so crazy then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Well, then, I can't remember where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| You did make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| We've got a motion in a second for up to three dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| No, just for the second plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Yeah, we're on the second plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Well, while we're still talking, I would just like to say, as we're considering this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| we could add that back as the requirement that we would only have development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| as Councilor had noted, that it would only be in that area that has already been disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| As we're looking at the aerial, not what was further seen, but what was used as the borrowed pit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| that would be my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4341)|
| 1:12:30| It's up to the motioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| So that was Mr. Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| Was it Mr. Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| That was Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Is that something we need to do on the sector plan now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Because right now we're on sector plan, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| That would be on the density side, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| It sounds like we were being guided to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| So I don't need to make that now, but whomever makes the motion for the second portion of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| I would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| We will duly note that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| So we've got a motion and a second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| On the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| On the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| And Commissioner Schelsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| For county engineering, are there any road plans along this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4394)|
| 1:13:25| Commissioner Schelsel, there are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| We recently installed a four-way stop downstream of this location due to some growing traffic on East Copeland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4408)|
| 1:13:35| But in this particular area, we have no plans to improve High School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| And the traffic impact analysis says there's no turn lanes are warranted from either direction, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4419)|
| 1:13:47| That is correct, and we concur with that analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| Does that take into account just current traffic volumes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| I mean, is that turn lane warranted change based on how traveled the road is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| We look at it, background traffic, and then they grow the traffic at a growth rate that we collectively discuss and agree upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4441)|
| 1:14:09| And then usually, I think it's two to three years, whenever the subdivision develops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| we apply the traffic that will supposedly be there two to three years down the road once those left turns are actually presented in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| And based on that, it did not meet our thresholds for turn lane warrants, either right or left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4461)|
| 1:14:32| Okay, we're ready for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Commissioner Higgins, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| I've got a question for staff, but it's regarding the density, so we can go ahead and vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Seeing no other lights on this particular motion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Chair will entertain a motion regarding the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| If I could just say something real quick just to follow up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| There might be, just looking at the Exhibit B for the disturbance area, there might be some realignment of the road that needed to be done on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| I just want to make sure we have the flexibility that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| The road itself might need to be realigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| That might be outside of Exhibit B on that condition, but the development site itself in that disturbed area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| I just didn't want to put ourselves in a corner on realigning that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| versus the area that's already been disturbed for the density and make that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| I apologize for jumping in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| I hope I didn't confuse everybody on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| May I talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Go ahead, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| I'm interpreting what you're saying as when you see the skinny little line that goes out, you may need to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| That may be adjusted one way or the other based upon the topography and how it aligns with the current road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| and so even though that's part of the previous disturbed area, that may have to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| but there's that larger overall island of disturbed area that will be the footprint for the development itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4564)|
| 1:16:14| So I just want to clarify we have some flexibility with realigning the road as needed per engineering standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4574)|
| 1:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| To leave my light on, but just kind of thinking about the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| I just see this area as somewhere where we'll continue to see cases like this, and we won't have turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| and this is going to be like Choteau Road someday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| and we're going to be here talking about how we need to maybe not widen it by lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| but widen it by a foot or two to make it safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| and so I guess in thinking about the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| that's what I'm concerned about granting more than the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| is are we going to continue to go down this perpetual cycle of overbuilding an area with a road that won't be able to handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4622)|
| 1:17:12| Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| With respect to that, yeah, I don't disagree with that thought about thinking about the roads in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| but this road, I mean, it's 21 to 23 feet wide currently, which is, you know, you mentioned the Choteau area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| I mean, we had just last month the Harvey Road in Choteau zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| We approved it three units an acre, and I don't know that Choteau Road's up to 23, or pardon me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| the North Shore Drive in that area is that wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| You know, that being said, I mean, I'm comfortable at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| I like the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| I don't like the idea that it's been disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| I like the idea that the applicant is going to try to maintain that in there, so I'll take a shot at it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4673)|
| 1:18:02| So I'm going to make a motion to approve up to three dwelling units per acre because it has consisted with the recommended LDR land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4682)|
| 1:18:12| and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| However, the disturbed area shall remain roughly what is in the 2020 KGIS aerial from the rear of the property to High School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4696)|
| 1:18:31| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| If you say from the rear of the property to High School Road, that could mean that they clear the entire area of where the…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4713)|
| 1:18:41| Yes, and what I'm referring to is the cleared area in the 2020, see the yellow cleared area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| From the back line of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Oh, sorry, side to side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Towards High School Road because that will give them the flexibility to put that entrance, road entrance where they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4732)|
| 1:19:01| Council, would that be accurate for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| It would give us flexibility because we'll have to meet the slope requirements for the entrance and the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| and I don't know if that current driveway does or not yet, so that's going to have to be worked out during the development plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4753)|
| 1:19:21| Okay, so my motion is for a density of up to three dwelling units per acre and containing any of the development to the disturbed area in the 2020 aerial and up to High School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4761)|
| 1:19:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| Okay, we got a motion from Commissioner Huber to approve up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| You want to finish that off for me again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| As you look at the 2020 KGIS, it's up on the screen right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| Disturbed area, the yellow dirt area, if you come from the very furthest point away from High School Road, we're giving them permission to develop and clear from that portion all the way up to High School Road, but not past it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4801)|
| 1:20:19| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Director Brooks, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| Sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Staff can revise the previous exhibit to reflect what the commissioner has said, and it can be included as part of the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| Okay, so we have a motion to approve up to three dwelling units per acre with the specifics that Commissioner Huber cited, seconded by Commissioner Levenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4831)|
| 1:20:42| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| This is a question for Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| I'm sorry, I wasn't clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| My concern is that if the motion is passed the way that it was stated, that looking here, the two patches of undisturbed area that are on the left and right of the road as it's currently cut, those would be completely cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4850)|
| 1:21:08| They would have the option to clear those, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| That doesn't necessarily mean they would clear them, but what council was indicating was that they're not sure exactly where that entry road is going to hit on High School due to some topography issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4870)|
| 1:21:21| So that does give them the flexibility there, but everything behind would stay intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4881)|
| 1:21:30| Would it be possible to simply say that there's flexibility for the realignment of the road as opposed to giving the ability, the option to clear the entire thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4890)|
| 1:21:40| Because I'm being the pessimist and worried that…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| Yeah, I mean, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| I think it would be a challenge at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Given we're just at zoning, they'll have to bring the concept plan back for planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| So I'd be a little hesitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| Just from my experience of developing properties like this, it's hard to pin it down that tightly right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4917)|
| 1:22:05| So I would prefer it to still have that flexibility for them to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| It looks like, and again I'm going off of this image, that Samuel indicated that some other portion of this had been disturbed, and that's why they changed their staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4931)|
| 1:22:35| And it looks like, I'm calling it the front part, but the portion between the really disturbed part and all the way to High School is what has been untouched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4955)|
| 1:22:44| That may just be my perception of this image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4964)|
| 1:22:52| May I clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| So the front…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Excuse me, my name is Stephen Clare, 7800 Senate Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| I'm representing the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| So the front portion is not completely undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| That actually, most of that is scrub brush, maybe 15 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| And so I think that my question would be, obviously we do need flexibility in the alignment of the road, especially to meet the slope requirements for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| And also to not cause an exceeding amount of grading to come straight up that hill, because the side where the driveway is is steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| But also if we're going to present this as a completed neighborhood in order to beautify it, I don't know that we want to bring that road through just scrub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5005)|
| 1:23:32| And I think as a developer we would be happy to present a landscape plan that showed that we were going to replace that with whatever type of planning that we would want to do to beautify that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5012)|
| 1:23:41| And we can do a dense evergreen, whatever it would need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| But there needs to be some flexibility in that just because of the look of it in general to sell the homes that are built in the neighborhood, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5024)|
| 1:23:52| Yeah, I'm tracking. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| If I can, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| So you're OK with everything behind that you're trying to keep everything where the yellow disturbed areas and forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5041)|
| 1:24:08| Yes, sir. Exactly. And I think my biggest concern with and I think you clarified it very, very nicely was originally there was a little dotted line that just followed the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5048)|
| 1:24:17| The problem is that whole area right there was disturbed and some of the transition from what you see on the left and the right of that, the patch that we keep talking about, it just drops off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5057)|
| 1:24:27| And so there's going to be required grading to make all those transitions to make stormwater flow with swales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| But what you said from the back of that out, we're great with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| Anything behind that, we're happy to leave and leave it undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| Most of that, it seems, was cleared at the time of them borrowing from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| It's grown up again. I don't know how many years ago the Kroger was built, probably five or six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| So it's generally the same size as the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| But we're happy to let that continue to grow and just work from that point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| Right. I mean, I've got a question for you. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| So just I mean, just my quick math on KGIS anyway, it looks like the total property is 34 acres in that ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5099)|
| 1:25:08| And it looks like the area behind it, because right, I mean, looking at the aerials and the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| it looks like the whole thing may have been cleared almost at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| Yes, sir. And then it regrew. And then there was a second grading operation in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| Yes, sir. What we're looking at with disturbed area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| And that's where you're going to keep it contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| Yes, it's a it's a good area of minimal grading, wonderfully provided that there was no rock on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| And it's an easy, easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| Obviously, we need some flexibility on the sides to make the transitions for the neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| Correct. So we're not dumping stormwater. But that that recommendation that you made is great with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| Yeah. So I mean, my final point is just scaling it off on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| It looks like that area behind there is almost 16 acres that they're going to that they're talking about leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| You know, so, you know, it's almost half of the property is going to be maintained by allowing them to put three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5154)|
| 1:26:02| They're forward. So I think that I think it's a good good motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| I noticed from the aerial, there's a power line cutting through. Is that does that have an easement associated with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| It does, sir. And our design that we've our concept plan that we'll be submitting based upon this recommendation will account for maintaining the distances of that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5174)|
| 1:26:22| We won't be building anything within that. Okay. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Because just thinking about how that will provide some limitations to the development in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5185)|
| 1:26:34| Then I had one question for staff. You mentioned the on exhibit B, the slope analysis, the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5194)|
| 1:26:45| When you all do that, is that looking at the dwelling units as single family or townhouses or is there a difference there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5205)|
| 1:27:00| There is no difference between the type of structures, but this is based off the inside protection and reach to plan and the maximum density of three dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5220)|
| 1:27:10| It's coming from the policy plan. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Yes, it's just based off a dwelling units per acre. Does it does it make sense to to use the same calculations for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5234)|
| 1:27:24| And I know that this zoning could be single family or townhouse, but does it make sense to to make this use the same calculations for a townhouse development as it was a single family neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5244)|
| 1:27:35| Since those dwelling units would be closer together with townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5255)|
| 1:27:43| I'm not sure that's something that we've discussed in depth. That might be something that we can consider going forward at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| That would just be a. Because I think it makes a lot more sense if it's for single family, the limitations of two per dwelling unit, because that's going to limit how much of the how many parcels there are getting cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5270)|
| 1:28:09| But with single family, if they're right up against each other, then that can live within a smaller footprint and disturb less area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5289)|
| 1:28:16| So I just and I know that we at this stage don't control what the use will be, but I'm pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5296)|
| 1:28:25| Maybe wonder if maybe there's a more nuanced way to look at it for developments that are doing higher density or closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5305)|
| 1:28:33| So, thanks. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| So we have a motion by Commissioner Huber, seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5322)|
| 1:29:01| Next is agenda item number twenty seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Applicant Benjamin C. Mullins, location east side of Ebenezer, south of Cedar Springs Lane and north of Rosemont Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| Present plan designation zoning is low density residential office, hillside protection, stream protection and exclusive residential plan commercial plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5351)|
| 1:29:22| Proposed plan designation zoning is low density residential office, hillside protection, stream protection, office, medical and related services and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5362)|
| 1:29:32| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry and vacant land. Density proposed five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5372)|
| 1:29:39| This will require two motions. Staff recommendation is approve the office and LDR land use classifications as specified in the exhibit map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5379)|
| 1:29:49| Because there are minor extensions that are compatible with surrounding development, hillside protection, stream protection areas would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5389)|
| 1:29:58| And the second recommendation for motion would be approve the OB office medical related services zone and the planned residential zone up to five dwelling units per acre as specified in the exhibit map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5398)|
| 1:30:11| Because there are minor extensions and are compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| And we have Mr. Mullins before us. Do we have opposition? All right. Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5416)|
| 1:30:25| Okay. Certainly. Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| I'll go ahead and proceed because as Mr. Klein said, he stole my thunder on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| I was going to say it's not so much opposition, more as a dialogue and a conversation with the surrounding property owners on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5437)|
| 1:30:46| This property is a large parcel property just south of Kingston Pike out in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| It's one of the larger tracks in District 3 that has still not been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5454)|
| 1:31:00| And it's been sitting there kind of like a sore thumb for a number of years with this planned commercial zoning along the front of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5460)|
| 1:31:09| which the family had gotten done back, I believe, in the early 2000s, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5469)|
| 1:31:17| This is the old DeBoard farm. A lot of the representatives, Mr. Klein's here for the neighborhood of Briar Glen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5477)|
| 1:31:25| Of course, there's also Suburban Hills to the kind of the northeast of this, and he's been representing them in our conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| This property is already partly zoned PR, and I think the intent, it was zoned at the same time as the Briar Glen subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5493)|
| 1:31:40| And you can see there's those roads that kind of dead end into that PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| And the intent was that eventually Briar Glen would be extended into that existing PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| Well, those plans never came to fruition, and eventually the zoning was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| Our plan is to take away all that planned commercial, which I think we agree with the neighborhood just doesn't make sense for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5515)|
| 1:32:03| There's that small parcel that's kind of cut out there. That's not part of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| It will remain planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| But to take that and convert it to OB until you get to the south and the portion that's abutting Briar Glen, change that to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5531)|
| 1:32:22| You can see the hashed area is going to go from PC to OB, which allows office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5542)|
| 1:32:29| There's an extension of OB there to the north, but it also allows all the residential uses that RB would allow, including multifamily, 12 units by right and up to 24 on a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5549)|
| 1:32:41| The PC is going to be the remainder of it, and we're going to do a mixed development where we do have some type of multifamily on the part that's going to be OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5561)|
| 1:32:52| and then have another entrance there off of Ebenezer for the planned residential and develop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| This was on the agenda last month, and at the request of the neighborhood and Commissioner Oster, who's here in the audience as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5578)|
| 1:33:08| we postponed it so we have more time to talk about their concerns, and we're still talking about those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| I think we're in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| We can reduce our zoning to four units an acre, I think, for the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| That's something that we have made to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| Also, interestingly, when Broglin was developed, the property line to the north, there was no peripheral setback applied to it because I guess it was supposed to be part of the PR there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5610)|
| 1:33:42| but we're going to maintain and agree not to seek a reduction in the 35-foot peripheral setback that's in the PR zone along the areas that are abutting those existing neighborhoods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5622)|
| 1:33:52| I'm sure there's enough separation between their property line and the buildings that we ultimately will develop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| We're also looking at doing some additional landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| If you look at the aerial there, there's quite a bit of landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| Broglin does a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| It's a beautiful community, and there's some existing landscaping there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| Our proposal is, and this is, I think, still part of the dialogue that's going on, is that we're going to fill in with some six-foot Arbor Green Giants 15 feet off center along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5653)|
| 1:34:26| I think they may want something a little beefier than that, and again, that's part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| We're just talking about what we have offered so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| The biggest issue, and when we postponed this, we had a meeting with the neighborhood, with both Suburban Hills and Broglin, and it was really well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5674)|
| 1:34:45| About 83 people attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| It was during the great snow, so that should tell you that it was a Thursday on the great snow, so the roads were passable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| Ms. Oster even got Mr. Snowden to appear, which I know that everything that he had dealt with that week, that was a colossal task, and I really appreciate his efforts to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5693)|
| 1:35:03| But we answered questions about how this process works, and there will be a development plan moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| But the biggest issues are the stub outs that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| The neighborhood doesn't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Commissioner Oster doesn't want it, and we're fine with not having the stub outs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| We think we can design our subdivision in a way that we'll be able to meet all the additional codes without having to connect to those existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5719)|
| 1:35:28| So with all that said, I know Mr. Klein has got some things he wants to say as well, but I think we're working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5728)|
| 1:35:36| I think we'll continue to work together, and we'll be happy to try to work through these issues before we get to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| But at this stage, we just ask that you go ahead and approve per staff's recommendation with the reduction of density being to four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5743)|
| 1:35:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Councilor Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| Wayne Klein, Hodges Study and Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| We're now at 445 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| Mr. Klein, if I may interject here, I just want to make you and others aware that I think we do have two others signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5764)|
| 1:36:13| On behalf of this matter, I will then attempt to be brief and reserve any remaining time to come back and talk if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5773)|
| 1:36:22| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Mr. Mullins has discussed where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| We were not so concerned with connectivity until we got to the pre-agenda meeting, and now we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| I must say that I don't think that this body has legal authority to condition their approval of either a sector plan change or zoning based upon the use of stub outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5795)|
| 1:36:50| And with that on the record, it is important to my clients who are Briar Glen Homeowners Association, if you're here, put your hand up in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5810)|
| 1:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| The public who's out there have been paying taxes, some of them since the early 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| They bought their property and saw things change, and they're relying on those stub outs not to be used because we're cooperating with the developer who doesn't want to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5830)|
| 1:37:23| And so why would this body want to then try to enforce something that nobody in the community wants and all the adjacent property owners don't want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5843)|
| 1:37:33| I would ask that you not consider using some type of condition or applying some type of condition on your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5853)|
| 1:37:46| Suburban Hills is an adjacent property with a low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| Briar Glen has a low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Hannah Place is an adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| None of them want connectivity through stub outs, and all of them are seeking to work cooperatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| I'm not here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| Work cooperatively to get this thing to a compatible state, and compatibility is the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5887)|
| 1:38:15| And that's why the staff recommendation includes compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| And so we'd ask that the land use classification, the sector plan amendment, the zoning and density be as described with no conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5900)|
| 1:38:30| I will yield because other people want to talk, but that's the import of where we want to be, and I'll come back as time allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5910)|
| 1:38:41| And you might want to ask your lawyer about that legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| Thank you, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| I already have, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| Mr. Varnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5929)|
| 1:39:02| I'm Zach Varnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| I live at 8720 Sandhurst Drive in the Suburban Hills neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| And when we moved there a couple of years ago, my wife and I and three of our kids, we moved there primarily for the walkable street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5948)|
| 1:39:17| So what everything Mr. Klein just said, that was a huge that's a huge deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| The being able to walk our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| And I mean, our neighborhood is one where kids are all over the place all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| We're already concerned about some of the traffic flow through the neighborhood that connects from Kingston Pike to Gleason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| And so our concern is the implications of this zoning amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| We are definitely not opposed to the development to development of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| We wouldn't say that that's a sore, you know, or anything, but we would say that was a beautiful farm, but we knew development was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| And we do appreciate Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| We want him to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| The concessions he's already given us and ways he's thinking we are very grateful for and appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| So the question we have is, is this what Mr. Klein is talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| Is this a guarantee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Can we guarantee that the traffic problems that will come on old Ebenezer and Gleason because of this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6010)|
| 1:40:19| Will they not lead to having a request and then come through our neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| That's our big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| I'm not a mathematician, but when Mr. Snowden at the community meeting talked about a net zero desire for what was going to be developed with these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6026)|
| 1:40:37| When you look at old Ebenezer and you look at Gleason and you already see the existing traffic problems, plus the existing flooding issues in those two those two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6037)|
| 1:40:48| It's hard to think that that's not going to cause tremendous, tremendous damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| So I just want to be on the record saying that unless there's radical changes to Gleason and Ebenezer, much more than just a turning lane that's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6052)|
| 1:41:01| I think what represents our neighborhood is to keep these zoning restrictions down and not allow for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6061)|
| 1:41:09| Keep these zoning restrictions down as far as they can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| I don't know what the terminology is, but I'm sure you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| That's a request. I'm done. Sorry. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| Mr. Keith Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| Thank you. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Hi, I'm back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| Byron Glenn continues to work with Mr. Smith and Ebenezer Holdings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| He's the principal for Ebenezer Holdings and his attorney, Ben Mullins, in negotiating the maintenance of a peripheral setback and PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6098)|
| 1:41:47| And so we're comfortable with the continued dialogue and we hope to have that solved by the time it gets to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6107)|
| 1:41:55| Our landscape buffer between these two developments is extremely important and we have dug our heels in and are working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| And so to the extent that Mr. Mullins represents what it might be, we're still working at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6123)|
| 1:42:13| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| I just wanted to confirm my understanding that the appropriate time to discuss the stub outs and connectivity is during the development plan rather than the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6144)|
| 1:42:33| Is that correct? I would certainly agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| And having conversation with Director Brooks, I think she would come in the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| First off, I would certainly like to commend counsel, Mr. Klein and Mr. Mullins and Mr. Smith, certainly for for working with the neighbors, because it's a it's a challenging situation, as we all know, sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6167)|
| 1:43:02| And so it brings me great joy to see you guys working together and working hard on trying to do it right, because this is a it's a wonderful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6182)|
| 1:43:12| It's been around for a long time and been very underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| It's been zoned commercial for many, many years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| Could be developed as commercial right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| So I think I think some sort of transitional use between there, if it's office or if it is ultimately some multifamily or along with even stepping it down even more to the the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6203)|
| 1:43:37| you know, be it single family detached or some sort of attached product in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| I think it's a I think it's a great use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| I think that that engineering got all the confidence in the world and them to take a hard look at Ebenezer and the traffic flows in the area to make sure that everybody's safe and, you know, gets along well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6224)|
| 1:43:59| So with that, I would like to go ahead and make a motion to approve per staff recommendation, approve the office and LDR low density residential land use classifications as specified in the exhibit map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6239)|
| 1:44:13| because there are minor extensions that are compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| The hillside protection and the stream protection would remain safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| OK, we have a motion to approve the sector plan for staff recommendation by Commissioner Huber, seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6265)|
| 1:44:35| We still have lights on. Let's go to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| Thank you. I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| And for the. Everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| And I apologize. I wasn't at Tuesday's meeting. I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| But so I don't really know how the conversation around connectivity went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| But I do. Even though, yes, it is too early to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| I think that there are you can look at the map and see there's three stub outs touching this currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6301)|
| 1:45:09| And it's on Ebenezer Road. I think that the connectivity is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| And so as you all move into the planning phase, a phase of this project and start laying it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| I think that when you come back with the development plan, there should be connections at those existing stub outs for better connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6320)|
| 1:45:30| And, you know, dead end streets are not helpful for community growth or walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6330)|
| 1:45:38| And so I think that as you know, with with limitations, topography, I understand there's a lot of different limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6338)|
| 1:45:45| But I do think that a development plan that connects to the adjacent parcels would be the best to bring back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6345)|
| 1:45:54| Thanks. Thank you, Commissioner Schill. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| For Commissioner Higgins on Tuesday, I was inquiring if we could require the connectivity to stub out as a condition of the base zone PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6360)|
| 1:46:10| That's where that discussion was coming from. It was really more of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| And I'm not going to make a motion to require it today or anything, but I do feel like I'm in a dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6376)|
| 1:46:25| That's not like a real life that, you know, we have these subdivision regulations that are supposed to promote connectivity, build neighborhoods in which people live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6385)|
| 1:46:37| But no one's pinched me yet. And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| We've seen it come before this body multiple times where stub outs are not utilized and we end up in a situation down the road where you can't walk around except in circles within your own subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6403)|
| 1:46:58| And so it's disheartening. And I would think that if there's some single family residential and maybe that part of that property, maybe those connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6418)|
| 1:47:07| And then the front part, that's maybe office or dense could stay on Ebenezer, because, I mean, that's going to cause problems on everyone trying to turn out on Ebenezer, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6427)|
| 1:47:18| But, you know. That's my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| We want to get this sector plan out of the way first and we can continue conversation related to the stub outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6444)|
| 1:47:31| Do we have so we have a. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| OK. Commissioner Adams. I'm speaking about stub outs as well, but it's contiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6457)|
| 1:47:48| The thing I want to say is similar to Commissioner Higgins, is that I understand that the large conversation around this will happen with the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6468)|
| 1:47:59| But what I tend to experience is that the development plan comes and then when we want to make adjustments to that, the language is often, well, we've already invested this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6479)|
| 1:48:09| That would take a lot of rework, et cetera. So I, too, want to say I understand that the community is saying we're not really interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6489)|
| 1:48:17| But this property is primed for that. And and we have been tasked and the larger community has said that they want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6497)|
| 1:48:26| So I encourage you to come with a plan that does consider connectivity with the options that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| That doesn't mean utilize every single one of them, but just think about those things so that when we're looking at that development plan, we have some of those connectivity considerations in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6511)|
| 1:48:46| Well, while we're on that topic, I might as well comment, you know, I'm always an advocate of connectivity, but connectivity is not always appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6526)|
| 1:48:58| And, you know, we have a neighborhood here. We have all the parties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| You know, I've seen I could I could reel off, you know, several neighborhoods that were ill affected by connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| So I think we while it seems good in theory and often it is good, it's not always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6549)|
| 1:49:17| And I could see, you know, even some of these other neighborhoods being a reverse cut through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6557)|
| 1:49:23| And so I just think we ought to be open minded to and certainly consider the folks that are that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6563)|
| 1:49:33| And the developer who's worked with the community, we've always encouraged the developer to work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| So and I also agree that the appropriate time to deal with that is at the development plan level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| So, you know, county commission could even intervene prior prior to us to to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| So we have Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| Yeah, I was trying to kick this to the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| But since we're all commenting, I'll throw in my two cents, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| I think, you know, my understanding of this body is we're charged to make long kind of term land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| And I think when we think about public infrastructure like roads, you know, those are going to be there for decades beyond kind of current residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6607)|
| 1:50:15| And I think there is well established kind of research and doctrine that, you know, connectivity is beneficial for a variety of reasons in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6615)|
| 1:50:24| And so if we think about that in the context of physical infrastructure for the county, I think it's short sighted of us to overemphasize kind of the desires of current surrounding residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6624)|
| 1:50:36| And, you know, we make a lot of decisions here that don't necessarily satisfy the desires of surrounding residents, whether that's density, whether that's other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6636)|
| 1:50:43| We just renamed a street that didn't meet the voting of surrounding residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| So I think when we think about connectivity, we should do it with the long range context of infrastructure and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6647)|
| 1:50:55| And so, yeah, to be continued, I guess, at the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| Thank you for your comments. Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| Well, just for clarification, connectivity is a broad statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6663)|
| 1:51:10| Is connectivity a path between the two neighborhoods, a sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| Is connectivity a road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| I mean, it's such a broad statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| I think the neighbors don't want traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| But then on the other hand, I don't know if they'd mind have a connectivity to have another place to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| So I think my confusion when we keep throwing around connectivity is to define what connectivity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6692)|
| 1:51:42| And right now I'm I'm thinking, is it a road or is it a path?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6702)|
| 1:51:49| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And just want to help connect us all back to the motion before us and call previous question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6713)|
| 1:52:03| All right. We have a motion and a second related to the sector plan per staff recommendation to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6723)|
| 1:52:13| All in favor say aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| Commissioner Huber, I'd like to make a motion to approve OB office medical and related services zone and the planned residential zone up to five dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6737)|
| 1:52:27| An acre as specified in the exhibit map, because there are minor extensions that are compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6747)|
| 1:52:36| We have a motion by Commissioner Huber to approve per staff recommendation on the rezoning and seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6756)|
| 1:52:47| Seeing no other lights. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6771)|
| 1:53:02| All right. Agenda item 28. Applicant Kendra 8th location southwest side of Ellis Town Road, southeast of Rutledge Pike, 1.85 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6782)|
| 1:53:14| Present zoning is agricultural. Zoning requested, low density residential, existing land use, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6794)|
| 1:53:22| Staff recommendation is to approve the planned residential zone up to one and a half dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6802)|
| 1:53:29| because it is consistent with the sector plan and appropriate given the environmental constraints on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6809)|
| 1:53:37| Is the applicant present? And do we have any opposition? Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6817)|
| 1:53:50| Seeing none. If you'll give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| My name is Kendra 8th and I'm at 1715 Ellis Town Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| I just want to thank you for hearing this today. And I just kind of want to explain what I am trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6837)|
| 1:54:04| I just want to add one other single family residence to move my parents here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| My father is almost 80 and he's in very bad health. Aside from that, I have a lot of disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6850)|
| 1:54:19| I also have a five year old with autism. So it would be nice for my mother to be here to help me as much as I can help her with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6859)|
| 1:54:28| I do know that in the beginning of this, there was mentioned that the only problem may be that it is an unmaintained road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| But that is not true. It is a county maintained road and northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| Knox Utility District's water plant is at the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| So I don't really know why that would be an issue. It's just two people with one vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6884)|
| 1:54:51| Most of the time they will probably ride with me anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| And that's pretty much all I had to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| All right. Thank you. Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6899)|
| 1:55:07| Commissioner Smith, if you could. I could barely hear that for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| Motion to approve. All right. We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| Second. OK. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| Per staff recommendation by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Higgins. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| Agenda item 29. Applicant Justin Brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| Location Black Road and Ridgeland Drive. Nine point nine four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| Present plan designation zoning is agricultural hillside protection. Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| Proposed plan designation zoning. Low density residential hillside protection. Planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6946)|
| 1:55:52| Existing land use. Rural residential. Single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| Density proposed up to two point nine nine dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6956)|
| 1:56:03| This will require two motions. Staff recommendation is to approve the rural residential land use classification because it's consistent with surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6963)|
| 1:56:11| Hillside protection would be retained. And the second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| Staff recommendation approved. Planned residential zone with up to two point nine nine dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| Zone because it is consistent with the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| The applicant present. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6986)|
| 1:56:33| And do we have opposition? OK. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| So would the applicant like to proceed or defer? Defer. Defer. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| So. Mr. Robert Berlasky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7004)|
| 1:57:01| I'm not sure how many other people wish to speak because there wasn't clear from the instructions that we have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7021)|
| 1:57:09| Yeah. Two more. Three in total. Two more after you. Two more. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| I'm not sure if one of them is a geological engineer, but I've submitted comments already to the commission there fairly extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7034)|
| 1:57:23| And I think this just illustrates some of the issues of trying to infill these areas where we have a lot of housing surrounding and we have a beltway of hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7043)|
| 1:57:36| And we're really concerned and we have a lot of concern because we already have a lot of storm runoff and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7056)|
| 1:57:46| And we have and we've had already had alteration of the of the landscape there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7066)|
| 1:57:53| And one of the aspects of this is that there's really two very distinct areas involved in this parcel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7073)|
| 1:58:01| I was proposing that we that you could divide the process into the phase one into the phase two areas there because I'm not sure who wishes to address the phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7081)|
| 1:58:13| But I think there are many of us who live downhill from that hill who are very concerned about any possible development on the on the phase two area at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7093)|
| 1:58:21| And we're not aware of there being a need or a plan to actually develop that area at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7101)|
| 1:58:28| And so I was feel that we would be best to defer action on that phase two area and allow some further study that would integrate that whole wooded area that extends down from the villas all the way up to the top of the hill there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7108)|
| 1:58:43| That forms a buffer between the development on Black Street and all the new houses along the Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7123)|
| 1:58:49| And at this point, I'll defer to let someone else speak and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| Clinton Tommen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| Good afternoon. Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| Just want to touch on a couple of things that some of the citizens were concerned about other residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7148)|
| 1:59:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| I'm from 1229 loggerhead lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| So I've talked to some of the other residents there and some of their concerns is that the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7162)|
| 1:59:30| Development is like on the steepest slope right above where Braxton Creek is on that steepest part of the whole property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7170)|
| 1:59:39| We don't see any issue actually with phase one is listed in the application dated on to two of twenty twenty four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7179)|
| 1:59:47| Along the north side of Black Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| But we worry about the phase two aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| The common area of berms along the side of the common area behind our mailboxes at the lot number 16 and number 17 are high enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7194)|
| 2:00:04| The water coming down from the east northeast corner of Braxton Creek would not overflow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7204)|
| 2:00:13| All the water that will run through the low place to the east of the mailboxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| I would request that the company that is handling the new housing addition and solid ditch liner at the low place where the water runs into and out of our common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7219)|
| 2:00:30| Back in 2019, we had 17 inches of rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| So that caused a lot of flooding just the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| So we're concerned about, you know, with the driveways and playgrounds and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| Water's in the roads. The water's going to run a lot freer without anything to catch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| So if they could put in some drains to divert, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| With a house built up on the hill from the northwest corner of Braxton Creek, it could cause more water to flow into lot 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7251)|
| 2:00:59| We'd request that when the work starts in phase two, that a shallow drainage ditch be installed along the side trail that exists along the fence line today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7259)|
| 2:01:08| That would keep the water from running into the back of lot 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7268)|
| 2:01:17| If the builder of that new addition installed a shallow drainage ditch along the fence line north of the towns, we have some townhomes right above us, just about no water would flow into their common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7277)|
| 2:01:30| Again, that part of the nine-acre property drains pretty much to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| Any overflow of that retention pond would be captured by the huge deep sinkhole they have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7296)|
| 2:01:44| We have an overflow basin that we keep dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| Unfortunately, the towns, the townhomes above us like to keep theirs filled with water already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7309)|
| 2:01:58| We have ducks and we have geese in it and frogs and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| So, I mean, it's already at capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| We're thinking any kind of flooding is going to make that flood even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| If we can get some drainage ditches in there to divert that water, that would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Mr. Bill Broughton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7335)|
| 2:02:21| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| Bill Broughton, 1295 Loggerhead Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| We've lived there about a year and a half, and I would call it memory lane for us because most of the people on the subdivision are at retirement age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7346)|
| 2:02:34| We bought this as our retirement home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| My home is the one, lot 16, that we've invested over $5,000 just in the last year to try to divert water that already comes off the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7356)|
| 2:02:47| Ignorant to the process, I'll just say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| We only found out, the majority of us, about the subdivision plans within the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| Having sat here for the last few hours, I hear how the developers speak with the people around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| We've had no conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| I'm not aware of any conversation about what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| What's being displayed up here doesn't show phase one and phase two because they are radically different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| We'd like to know what is phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| What kind of housing is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| There's just so much ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| Phase one puts houses along the black road, and I don't think I've heard anyone in our subdivision saying that that's not consistent with what's already happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7398)|
| 2:03:27| It's phase two where they're getting into the wood lines and they're creating a park and some other things back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7407)|
| 2:03:34| So, number one, there's an ignorance to the process and awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| There's been no communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| Number two, what we've already discussed, if you look at my house there, which is at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| that elevation has been a great challenge for my wife and I the last year of landscaping that and having others landscape it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7425)|
| 2:03:52| In fact, the company that cuts it has already tipped over and flowed down our hill and took out half of the bushes that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7432)|
| 2:04:01| So, when you look at that area, there is a significant risk that whatever they do there is going to add additional water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7441)|
| 2:04:08| and I'm not sure what our action would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| So, I wish that we were dealing with phase one, phase two, because you wouldn't get much concern on phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| And secondly, it would be nice to have communication about what phase two means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7463)|
| 2:04:30| Do we have anyone else that had signed up to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| Okay, we're not overlooking someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| My name is Justin Briner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| I live at 11912 Black Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| So, I'd like to take the opportunity to use this platform to address the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| I hope all you guys are doing well today, but also the concerns and remarks from my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7495)|
| 2:05:01| To be clear, phase two is not on the docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| I do not know if there will even be a phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| The second thing is nearly 100% of the opposing comments are due to the wrong documents being posted in the case file on KPC website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7510)|
| 2:05:20| This was resolved this past Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| So, what happened was I had submitted some stuff for traffic engineering to just, you know, like drawing on a napkin basically, like what could something be in phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7523)|
| 2:05:33| I have no idea, but I wanted to get a certain density for, you know, if I did need to do something or want to do something in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| That's all that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| Third, it's important for me that everyone knows I live at the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| And while I may be an avid local developer by trade, I also have incentive to develop quality homes that will fit with the existing surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7548)|
| 2:05:57| In response to some comments that were made online, Tom is the only one who made a comment relating to phase one, if we'll call it, the six houses along Black Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7557)|
| 2:06:13| And although it's related to phase one, all of those comments are related to concept and subdividing portion, not the rezoning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7573)|
| 2:06:21| All of the other comments, I think it's Frank, Randall, Alice, and Robert all had submitted some opposing arguments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7581)|
| 2:06:33| If I develop the back section of the property, which I'm calling phase two, all of your concerns mentioned will be considered and reviewed during the engineering process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7593)|
| 2:06:43| If I develop that area you are concerned with, there are systems in place to address your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7603)|
| 2:06:50| And I work with the best local engineering firms to have been designing, who have been designing subdivisions for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7610)|
| 2:06:58| I would not expect anyone who is not involved in development continuously or educated in civil engineering to know how or what is considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7618)|
| 2:07:06| Additionally, I don't feel it's my place to educate the neighbors, but want them to know as a resident myself that I care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| I do want the ability to develop phase two, hence my rezoning and density request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7633)|
| 2:07:19| Regardless of what I do with the property in the future, I am positive all engineering and designs will consider your concerns and can assure you that any development by me will meet or exceed all regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7639)|
| 2:07:31| That's really it. I just wanted to add, if there are any questions by any of my neighbors, they're welcome to knock on my door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7651)|
| 2:07:40| This is a quick process for me. I closed on the property November 4th and would like to get going on the houses on Black Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7660)|
| 2:07:51| But other than that, I don't really have any other plans. Thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| Thank you. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| Director Brooks, can you explain the wrong files being posted? Is that the case and did the community have the length of time they're supposed to have to be able to see the correct files?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7680)|
| 2:08:17| I'll address the first question. My understanding is that a TIL, Traffic Impact Letter, form was submitted, but that it was determined by County Engineering that it wasn't needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7697)|
| 2:08:30| I think that was the file that was posted. I'll look to staff to say yes or no. I think that's what I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7710)|
| 2:08:39| We have what we call a pre-submittal Transportation Impact Analysis Scoping Determination form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7719)|
| 2:08:45| Because this property is in the rural area in the Growth Policy Plan and they're asking for more than $2 million per acre, the Growth Policy Plan recommends a Traffic Impact Letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7725)|
| 2:08:54| In this case, when they submitted that pre-submittal form, which usually includes a site plan just so that everybody knows generally what they're wanting to do, and it's by no means what they have to do ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7734)|
| 2:09:09| It was determined that a Traffic Impact Letter wouldn't tell us anything that we don't already know, so we did not require a Traffic Impact Letter as part of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7749)|
| 2:09:21| And the second part of your question, if you don't mind repeating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| Having heard the developers say that the wrong files were posted, it made me concerned that the community had not had access to the public files for the length of time that they normally would have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7764)|
| 2:09:47| No, that wouldn't be the case for this particular type of application, this plan amendment rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| So the materials that would be part of the public file include the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7792)|
| 2:10:01| And then we also post our staff reports a week in advance, so all of that was done in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7801)|
| 2:10:08| The only other comment I have is just concern hearing the community member, at least one of them, say that they were in the dark about what was going on and just wanted more communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7808)|
| 2:10:20| And to the developer, that is something that this body looks to hear and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7820)|
| 2:10:27| You've heard it in a number of cases today that we're always encouraging that kind of dialogue so that there is transparency and you end up with the best project at the end and everyone seems a lot happier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7827)|
| 2:10:42| Thank you. Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| It seems to me like the primary concern here is how we're going to deal with the water here, water runoff issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7846)|
| 2:10:54| Engineering, are we far enough along where you could address some of those concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| We are not. They actually have a concept plan on the March agenda, and we've asked them for a conceptual plan for what they're going to do in Phase 2 so we can get an idea of what the drainage is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7860)|
| 2:11:19| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| May I say something or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7883)|
| 2:11:36| Procedurally, we're in the commission discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| Because he asked us if we had questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| You're welcome to go ahead and ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| Dealing with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| I'm just going to ask the group if there's any stomach for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| It's a genuine question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| I would say this about that, and we all, I think we're all unified in the fact that we do encourage developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7927)|
| 2:12:15| However, there's no requirement, and I just, it seems like we would then be making that more of a requirement, and I personally wouldn't support it as much as I want them to have dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7935)|
| 2:12:32| That's why I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| So, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to approve the rural residential land use classification because it's consistent with the surrounding area of the hillside protection area would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7954)|
| 2:12:45| Per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith to approve this sector plan change per staff recommendation seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7968)|
| 2:12:57| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| Chair will entertain a motion on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| So, I move to approve per staff recommendation the planned residential zone for up to 2.99 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7983)|
| 2:13:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| We have a motion on the rezoning to approve plan residential per staff recommendation by Commissioner Smith seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=7996)|
| 2:13:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| Let's take a 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| Let's resume, and we will resume by addressing agenda item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8024)|
| 2:13:50| Applicant, Smithbilt Homes, location west side of Roberts Road, north of Washington Pike, 74.73 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8030)|
| 2:13:59| Present plan designation and zoning is agricultural, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| Proposed plan designation and zoning is low-density residential, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8043)|
| 2:14:08| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| Density proposed, three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| Staff recommendation is to deny the low-density residential land use classifications because it would be out of character with the surrounding agricultural and rural residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8060)|
| 2:14:34| And the second motion is approve the planned residential zone up to one dwelling unit per acre because it will be consistent with the surrounding development and a minor extension of the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8074)|
| 2:14:46| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| Mr. Sanderson, do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| Defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| Number 34, Mr. Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8097)|
| 2:15:04| Mr. Chair, how many people are signed up today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| Looks like you and Mr. Trueblood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| Let's see if there's another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| Two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| I'll aim for about two and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| For the sector plan amendment, I believe it should be denied as staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| This entire area in northeast Knox was intentionally and deliberately designated agricultural land use classification in the 2015 sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8125)|
| 2:15:35| There was a strong desire expressed by the community and then supported and adopted by a county commission to preserve the agriculture and rural character of the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8135)|
| 2:15:44| So there is not a mistake in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| And in fact, in the land use classification table, this parcel checks all the boxes for agricultural and even more so, it actually meets all the requirements for agricultural conservation land use classification, which it states should be considered for undeveloped tracts with the best soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8149)|
| 2:16:08| Put a copy of the soil map in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| This property is almost, it's about 65 percent prime and locally important farmland soil as designated by USDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8170)|
| 2:16:19| So this is a really great piece of farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| And if anything, sector plan would probably be more appropriate to be amended to be agricultural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8183)|
| 2:16:28| In terms of the rezoning request, I don't believe it meets the required criteria for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8188)|
| 2:16:34| There aren't substantially changing conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| There haven't been sector plan amendments since the 2015 plan was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| The only zoning, if you zoom out a little bit in the last 20 years, was last year when somebody went from ag to rural preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8202)|
| 2:16:50| So that trend is actually going more rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| Before that, you've got to go 20 years to the subdivision to the south to find a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| So there's not changing conditions out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| More importantly, there's some adverse impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| Rezoning this planned residential could result in over 50 acres of prime and locally important farmland soil, which would be permanently lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8225)|
| 2:17:14| Very importantly, this is across the street from the Thompson Century Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8234)|
| 2:17:20| And MTSU administers that Century Farm program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| And in an email recently to staff and Advance Knox team, they stated that Tennessee Century Farms are jewels of historic and landscape preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8243)|
| 2:17:34| But we don't have mandatory development and design standards that kick in to protect the rural character, historic farm buildings, open space, and stuff that is in our agricultural area, especially when you have historic resources adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8254)|
| 2:17:51| So since we don't have those, PR, and this one I don't believe is even requested or recommended to be clustered, which is in the land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8271)|
| 2:18:01| I just want to finally point out there's a couple of criteria in the general plan that are really relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| There's a principle that prime agricultural land should be protected for continued farm use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| And another principle that the landscape of the rural areas in the growth policy plan should be conserved, including open space, historic site, and farm buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8292)|
| 2:18:21| So we think that there's some tools that may be coming, hopefully in Advance Knox, with some updated requirements in the UDO that could allow this to be developed more compatibly and ensure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8301)|
| 2:18:34| But right now, I think it's a little premature to rezone this one and start development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8314)|
| 2:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| Mr. Trueblood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8321)|
| 2:18:51| Brad Trueblood, 6542 Colossal Lane, Coryton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| And I only have a couple of points. I couldn't piggyback that if I tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8335)|
| 2:19:01| My concern, and some of our residents there in the subdivision, is a concern about trying to annex the feeder road, which is like 30 feet that was brought up to the property years ago when that Morabian Acres was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8341)|
| 2:19:20| The biggest thing there is there's not enough street from Roberts to the first stop sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8360)|
| 2:19:31| There's like 75 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| If they were going to feed traffic from that subdivision into Morabian, we would have a parking lot in that subdivision morning and night when people go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8373)|
| 2:19:44| I don't know a lot about traffic analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| I know how I think it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| There was one that was reported, and in looking at it, you would think nobody in Morabian ever got out of their house or drove out of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8390)|
| 2:19:58| I don't know how that was developed or taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| Like I say, I'm not an expert on it, but usually there's a traffic counter or something out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| I never saw it, but that doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| I faced Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| Big concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| A bigger concern, and maybe that's not in your wheelhouse, but it needs to be brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| Roberts Road is – I've lived in four states, and I can tell you this is – Roberts Road, even though we live on it, we didn't realize it when we bought the house when it was built four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8418)|
| 2:20:30| It's probably one of the most dangerous two-lane roads I've ever seen in my life because there's no shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8430)|
| 2:20:37| It's starting to deteriorate, and some of that's just people's driving, and we can't control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| I brought – I know it's not going to get shown now, but I brought some photos of the actual road in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8443)|
| 2:20:53| About every week when I mow, I check it, and there are tons of chunks of asphalt in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8453)|
| 2:21:03| I pick it up because I'm an OCD person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| I think that knowing that, and you can see cracks across it, there's no real potholes, but there are dips where it has sunken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8467)|
| 2:21:15| I think this kind of traffic on it, I think that needs to be addressed before anybody starts doing anything or we're all going to be in dire straits and travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8475)|
| 2:21:25| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| Did I overlook someone that intended to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| I'll sign in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8493)|
| 2:21:51| If you'll give your name and address and try to limit it to two minutes, and Mr. Sanderson, I'll give you an additional two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8511)|
| 2:21:58| Sure. Adam Thompson, Little Flat Creek Lane in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| As Mr. Murphy referenced, we are about 16 years away from being a bicentennial farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8521)|
| 2:22:08| We were 2023 NRCS Soil Conservation District Farmers of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| I grew up on Roberts Road and looking at this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8533)|
| 2:22:19| I didn't understand just how prime this farmland was until I started working it up and clearing it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8539)|
| 2:22:26| That soil is dark and it's deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| The epitome of prime farmland is that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| I'm kind of jealous, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8556)|
| 2:22:41| Like the gentleman before me stated, Roberts Road is not a safe road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8561)|
| 2:22:46| The two ends, there's not a traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| The end on Emory Road, it's a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| If you go to pull out on Emory Road, you've committed, you'd better go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8572)|
| 2:22:57| If you hesitate, there's plenty of accidents on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8577)|
| 2:23:01| I don't think there's any plans on improving Roberts Road, either end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| The other thing we need to take into consideration, too, is the application requested three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8585)|
| 2:23:13| They're zoned for Corrington Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| Has anybody been to Corrington Elementary School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| I was there when there was one classroom per grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| It's a small school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| We don't want to get ahead of ourselves and end up like Hardin Valley, where you have Hardin Valley Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8601)|
| 2:23:27| where there's 1,100 students in a building designed for 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Then you have to have Mill Creek and come in later and try to do a pressure relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| Let's get ahead of this and not put development ahead of what we're actually prepared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8615)|
| 2:23:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| Mr. Sanderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road, representing Smithfield Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8632)|
| 2:23:57| I respect the opinion of the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| To quote Mr. Murphy, check in boxes, the previous landowner called us when they were interested in selling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8641)|
| 2:24:07| and when we looked at it on the map, it was like, there's going to be no zoning around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| Well, we pulled up the zoning map, and right next door, one to three units an acre, so we checked that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| Well, there's probably no sewer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| Well, let's call KUB and get a letter from them and see them analyze the sewer capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| Boom, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| Way beyond three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| Well, I bet traffic is probably the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| Well, let's hire an engineer, and let's go study the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| Surely that's going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| Everyone else is saying it's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| No, no improvements needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| We've checked the boxes, and as a developer, we went ahead and closed on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| because we could not actually tell the landowner that there's one reason or one prime problem with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| I'm not trying to develop this sentry farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8687)|
| 2:24:51| Them conserving their farm, hats off to them that they can afford to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| We're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| We bought this farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| We have property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| We're trying to bring it in front of you for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| So at one unit an acre, not even worth commenting, not even worth talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| Two units an acre, when we bought it, that's probably what we assumed we were going to get, to be completely transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8708)|
| 2:25:13| But at three units an acre, what we can do is do something for this side of the community of Knox County that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8713)|
| 2:25:20| Build a community with amenities, with a pool, with sidewalks, with streetlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| with something that when we have more people in the community, they can afford more amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8725)|
| 2:25:30| Let us go knock on the doors of Murray Bend subdivision and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| Hey, would you all like to be a part of a big pool and amenities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| Optional, if you all want to join and increase their property value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| I don't see why not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| They talk about Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| Let's not get development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| Guys, sewer stops right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| There's no other pieces of land to have additional sewer and turn this into Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8750)|
| 2:25:59| Only thing we're going to do at one unit an acre is go next door and stub the sewer into that farm and build another one unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8759)|
| 2:26:06| Then go to the next one and build another one unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| It just doesn't make any sense when we have a willing and capable developer with a track record that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8768)|
| 2:26:14| Designing homes and communities that our homebuyers, we have a following with our homebuyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8774)|
| 2:26:25| People buy our house at our price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| It used to be pre-COVID, they'd make $25,000 of equity instantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| Post-COVID, they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| That's wealth that you cannot create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| First-time homebuyers, these Gibbs graduates that we say, go be a mechanic, go be a plumber, go be an electrician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8794)|
| 2:26:41| Don't go to Lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| You don't have to live in West Knoxville, but they want a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| They want to walk on the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| They want to push their stroller to the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| Don't rob this community of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| We're willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| You all get to see a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| We could come back in front of you and call me a liar the day I come back in front of a concept at 30 units an acre and I don't have a community pool or amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8815)|
| 2:27:01| Another thing, Knox County is going to say there's no improvements to Roberts Road planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8821)|
| 2:27:05| My traffic analysis says right now there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| But at 30 units an acre, something might come up and it might be private money that we volunteer to put shoulders on Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8828)|
| 2:27:15| So nothing's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| If there's already problems there that the general public is proceeding, give us a chance to improve that and work with the county and work on Roberts Road and improve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8837)|
| 2:27:24| Let us partner, not just, this is farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| This is, everyone has their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| The Century Farm can be a Century Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| This was meant to be a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| In 2007, Knox County staff said, let's dub this road out because this will be a future development too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8854)|
| 2:27:40| I will yield the rest of my time to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8860)|
| 2:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| I'll start off by saying I drove this road a few months ago to take our kids up to the pumpkin patch up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8873)|
| 2:28:05| And I remember driving it and thinking that I need to slow down because this road is pretty dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8885)|
| 2:28:13| You know, it seems like it could be very dangerous of another car because it's a narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8893)|
| 2:28:18| And I remember passing the subdivision that's existing right there and thinking, saying out loud, wow, that is out of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8898)|
| 2:28:28| That is very much, does not fit in with the character of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| And so looking at this right now, the comment about Hardin Valley and, you know, this becoming Hardin Valley or the comment from earlier about Choteau, you know, where now there's this all sorts of development and the infrastructure is really suffering because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8913)|
| 2:28:54| I see this this area as like, if you look at the map there, it is all green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8934)|
| 2:29:01| And I think that coming in with the development of this size is completely out of place, out of character and inappropriate for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8941)|
| 2:29:12| I think that it's going to put an added strain on the infrastructure that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8952)|
| 2:29:19| And I think that it could also lead to a bad precedent for adjacent farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8959)|
| 2:29:26| Just as we've seen all over the place, this this is a rural area and I think it needs to stay a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8966)|
| 2:29:33| It doesn't need to become a suburb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| So I oppose really any change to what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| And I think that it ideally would stay agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| I understand they may still separate it, cut it up and parcel it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8985)|
| 2:29:51| But I definitely don't think that higher density allowance is appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8991)|
| 2:29:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=8998)|
| 2:30:03| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| I, too, actually drove out there today, you know, to try to get a good feel for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9007)|
| 2:30:13| And I mean, no road's perfect in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| I mean, I know engineering does a great job of trying to keep everything up, but it's a large county and it does spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9017)|
| 2:30:25| I had a different experience on on Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| I mean, as I was driving down Emory Road in a lot of places, I didn't see a whole lot of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| And I think Emory Road's in pretty good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| I mean, you go down it, it has some inflections up and downs on on Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9036)|
| 2:30:43| But, you know, speaking of Mary Bend, actually, I drove through the subdivision there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9043)|
| 2:30:49| Beautiful homes, nice little suburban home area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| But like when you're pulling out onto Roberts Road, the sight distance to the left is a little iffy to me, you know, when you're pulling out onto Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9052)|
| 2:31:01| And I thought it was interesting, as Mr. Sanderson pointed out, that the planning staff and I'm sure commission required a stub out to the property next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9061)|
| 2:31:14| And we've had a lot of discussions about connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| You know, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| Jumping back to the Ebenezer Road, I wouldn't be as one we had earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| I wouldn't be as for that one being connected because it would draw a lot of that traffic directly through the entire subdivision where this one is located right at the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9085)|
| 2:31:35| I would almost see an opportunity to develop the property next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| And the opposite happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9100)|
| 2:31:41| Everybody in Mary Bend's using their entrance because it's safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| Because when you get really good sight distances, I could see on Roberts Road from the one next door, but it's marginal on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9105)|
| 2:31:53| Yeah, I mean, from the boxes where Mr. Murphy was talking about, I felt the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| I was like, gosh, it's, you know, it's got planned residential at three units an acre next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| It's the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| It's stubbed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| Yeah, I do kind of question the LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| I don't know if it's right to go to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| I think in your report you had mentioned if we did change that, maybe rural residential would be a more appropriate sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9129)|
| 2:32:17| I think that might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| But, you know, I think overall I think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| I mean, it's got sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| The road, if you look at it here, he's got it up on the aerial now or on the street view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9147)|
| 2:32:33| It's got the double yellow line in the middle and the white lines on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| And I don't know, Mr. Snowden, Director Snowden, does that mean certain widths or what does that show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9157)|
| 2:32:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9166)|
| 2:32:47| Yeah, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| Typically, and it can be said for all, I was measuring the aerial here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| It looks like it's approximately 19, 20 foot wide, which is typically what we'd want to see is a minimum for center and edge line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9172)|
| 2:32:58| It may vary a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| It's probably 19 in spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| But that's fairly calm and obviously very similar to a lot of county roads out in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9182)|
| 2:33:11| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| Yeah, to me, again, you know, I think it should be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9193)|
| 2:33:20| And I have all the respect in the world for the farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| And, again, this kind of gets back into I feel like maybe a little bit ahead of ourselves with the advanced NOx, where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9202)|
| 2:33:29| Advanced NOx would even support this in rural residential up to two units an acre, you know, where staff recommendations at one in planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9209)|
| 2:33:38| So I feel like that's low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| So, I mean, and it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| I realize it's a little further out on some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| But with the sewer there, that's a big part of advanced NOx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| You know, advanced NOx says, hey, we need to do development where the infrastructure is in, where the road's wide enough, where there's sewer lines, there's water lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9229)|
| 2:33:58| There's capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| And all those things are happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| You know, that being said, on the sector plan, I will go ahead and make a motion to approve rural residential land use classification because it would be in character with the surrounding agriculture and rural residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9243)|
| 2:34:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9264)|
| 2:34:30| Okay, so on the sector plan, we have Commissioner Huber making a motion to approve rural residential, seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9270)|
| 2:34:40| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9280)|

| 2:35:49| Rezoning. Commissioner Schelso. A question for staff then with the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9349)|
| 2:36:01| residential in place now what would be a recommended density? The Northeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9361)|
| 2:36:11| County Sector Plan only recommends rezoning with densities at one dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9371)|
| 2:36:19| unit per acre or less. I'll make a motion to approve PR up to one and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9379)|
| 2:36:32| half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| Director Brooks could you share with us what rural residential will allow as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9395)|
| 2:36:49| as density goes? The rural residential within this specific sector plan only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9409)|
| 2:36:55| allows up to one dwelling unit per acre or less. I think the question you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9415)|
| 2:36:59| asking is is it permitted to go up to three so that goes back to the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9419)|
| 2:37:03| policy plan which does allow consideration of up to three in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9423)|
| 2:37:08| rural area but it also it needs to be tied back to that LDR which you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9428)|
| 2:37:15| already decided to go to rural residential. I know it's very confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9435)|
| 2:37:20| all the different layers of plans. So just so that commissioners are aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| they could go they do have the authority to go up to three based on the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9446)|
| 2:37:32| policy plan. But with the sector plan that we just approved that's capped at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9452)|
| 2:37:37| one correct? Per the adopted Northeast County Sector Plan. But that can still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9457)|
| 2:37:46| you can still zone. I'm sorry. You can still zone higher than because I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9466)|
| 2:37:53| have not made that motion. Does this body have the authority to approve up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9473)|
| 2:37:59| three? You all have. Would you say guided by the growth policy plan? Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9479)|
| 2:38:06| sufficient? Our recommendation would be to what we already given you our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9486)|
| 2:38:10| recommendation. So you all can make a different recommendation and for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9490)|
| 2:38:14| Onondaga County Commission. And I've made a motion to approve up to one and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| half. We're still at the commission level here. I'm curious why you chose 1.5? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9497)|
| 2:38:38| made it up. I like your honesty. It seems a bit of a balance of over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9518)|
| 2:38:49| recommendation. But in all seriousness if you could state a basis for the 1.5 so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9529)|
| 2:39:07| that there is not a question about whether that is an arbitrary decision on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| your part. Yeah so I mean we have to pick a number I suppose if we're gonna pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9552)|
| 2:39:21| something and it's it's more than the recommendation but it doesn't quite go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| to you know three which I you know I don't see three fitting the area. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9565)|
| 2:39:35| adjacent property I don't know when that got approved or how that got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| approved but it as Logan said it really doesn't appear to fit the area and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9578)|
| 2:39:45| know one and a half is half of three. So I think if you reduce the density by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9585)|
| 2:39:51| three by half it would fit better. I wonder if I could just say that with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9591)|
| 2:40:01| the question with the new sector plan I from a legal standpoint does that open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9601)|
| 2:40:08| up the possibility of I feel like we should limit to one and not go over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9608)|
| 2:40:14| without a very strong reason and just stick to staff's recommendation because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9614)|
| 2:40:19| of the requirements written into that. I mean no one seconded my motion so it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9619)|
| 2:40:24| fail. Would you consider amending your motion to one? Let's just let it fail and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9624)|
| 2:40:31| then someone can make a new motion. Okay I'm not hearing a second so motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9631)|
| 2:40:42| So I'll make a motion to go for one as per staff's recommendation one dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9642)|
| 2:40:49| unit per acre and we'll add to that that I having heard all the conversation one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9649)|
| 2:40:55| thing that concerns me is that the only compelling argument I've heard well the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9655)|
| 2:41:02| only argument that I've heard today for three planning didn't recommend it we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9662)|
| 2:41:09| heard opposition to it was the developer saying it just wouldn't be worth my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9669)|
| 2:41:15| unless we went to three and I could do all this great stuff if we went to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| and that to me is great for the developer but it's not what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| supposed to be concerned with so for that reason and hopefully this satisfies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| if the council needed a reason that I would make a motion for one. So we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9687)|
| 2:41:38| motion by Commissioner Adams which would be approved plan residential per staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| recommendation. Second, did I hear a second by Commissioner Perez? Okay so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9704)|
| 2:41:50| have a motion and a second we have more lights to discuss matters here so let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| go to Commissioner Smith. Thank You Mr. Chairman and honestly I'm I get where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9714)|

| 2:43:04| into is that too much space and we end up with sprawl so just some things to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9784)|
| 2:43:09| consider as we're going through this I think the happy median really is around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9789)|
| 2:43:14| two because that leaves a good sized lot for families to be able to still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| participate in what that area is with agriculture while living in an area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| they desire to live in because of its uniqueness in East Knoxville and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9803)|
| 2:43:28| community and the schools that are around there so just things for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| everybody to kind of keep in mind having been from that area honestly we live not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9811)|
| 2:43:37| too far from that community we live right over off Murphy Road Mr. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| know if he's still here Mr. Murphy's a neighbor just down the road from us so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| you know I don't want to lose the culture of agriculture in that area but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9824)|
| 2:43:52| there's also people want to move there so let's do this smartly and think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9832)|
| 2:43:57| about this long term not just based on what we want right this minute based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| personal preferences let's think about what's best for the community in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| long term thank you Commissioner Smith I want to ask engineering we see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9845)|
| 2:44:18| adjacent neighborhood at three dwelling units per acre so apparently you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| were how would this change any concerns that that you guys have if this went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9863)|
| 2:44:29| three dwelling units per acre are they added concerns and I would ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9869)|
| 2:44:39| applicant I think his traffic study was predicated on three dwelling units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9879)|
| 2:44:45| acre and I think there was the potential for maybe a left turn lane at I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9885)|
| 2:44:51| remember it's it's been in it but there would I think there would be or would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| require some additional improvements at three dwelling units an acre yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| okay so and you all would at that point require that we would yes if you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9898)|
| 2:45:06| chose to go to three dwelling units an acre there would be additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9906)|
| 2:45:09| improvements that we would require to mitigate that additional traffic thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| you Commissioner Overton thank you yeah part of the reason I decided to join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9913)|
| 2:45:21| this body was to advocate for young Knox civilians because as you all are well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9921)|
| 2:45:25| aware there's a housing crisis here but I'm the only person up here that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9925)|
| 2:45:29| living that and this is exactly the type of development that's gonna help that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| problem we've got a developer here who's done his due diligence so to speak he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9934)|
| 2:45:38| looked at all of the infrastructure he's looked at what he can and can't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| before he even brought it before us and so for us to deny it because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| emotional about a farmland that's already been sold to a developer no one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9946)|
| 2:45:51| raising cattle no one's growing corn on that land as it stands no one's offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| to buy it so the developer owns it and we've got a great development coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| that he said could help Gibbs high school graduates own a home in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9959)|
| 2:46:04| stay here you know plant roots and stuff and help with the existing we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9964)|
| 2:46:10| houses to buy and so we need them and so you've got a responsible developer here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| with an attractive development why would we not say yes to that thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9974)|
| 2:46:20| Commissioner Higgins I just want to kind of respond to a couple of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9980)|
| 2:46:30| and arguments and add to my thinking because yeah I think that higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9990)|
| 2:46:37| density I'll although for higher density all day long in the appropriate areas in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=9997)|
| 2:46:43| rural or in in more urban areas where we have the infrastructure built up where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| you know the it's already been developed for that this has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10008)|
| 2:46:55| developed this infrastructure has not been developed for higher density and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10015)|
| 2:46:59| don't of course I know three dwelling units neighbor is not high density by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10019)|
| 2:47:04| any means but I I am trying to think long term because I think this something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10024)|
| 2:47:11| of this size if you look around this this area is not what you would call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| suburban sprawl you would not use the word sprawl for most of this area once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10034)|
| 2:47:20| this is built that's going to be the catalyst for sprawl and you know again I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10040)|
| 2:47:26| would be against really against anything on this because this is this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10046)|
| 2:47:33| problem that we see so often come before us that people have invested in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10053)|
| 2:47:40| moved into an area that was rural and now it's it's overgrown the traffic is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10060)|
| 2:47:46| is hard to manage and this is like clear area and so not from a oh I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10066)|
| 2:47:55| keep here the birds chirping and and that kind of standpoint but just from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10075)|
| 2:48:01| strategic long-term planning standpoint this is not a good I don't think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10081)|
| 2:48:08| a wise location to be developing or to start to add subdivisions left and right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10088)|
| 2:48:16| and and I just think that this will be a catalyst for that so that's why I pose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| it is for the long-term thinking thanks thank you let's see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10100)|
| 2:48:27| Commissioner Huber yeah I want to touch on the affordability thing again I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10107)|
| 2:48:34| I think that's a huge issue that we have and in with what we approve I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10114)|
| 2:48:40| we're talking about acre lots who buys an acre lot anymore nobody one they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| can't afford it two they don't want to maintain it you know I mean from a cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10124)|
| 2:48:50| perspective you're literally doubling the cost of that lot so you can imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10130)|
| 2:48:57| what that'll do to the house I mean we're talking about you know if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10137)|
| 2:49:01| three units an acre you know they could probably build a house that's maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10141)|
| 2:49:05| 350 $400,000 you know 400,000 something like that you you go to one unit per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10145)|
| 2:49:11| acre with acre lots it's gonna force something that's not in the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10151)|
| 2:49:15| there's I mean you're gonna force it to a million dollar homes and you know to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10155)|
| 2:49:19| mother Commissioner down here you know when who can afford that and who wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10159)|
| 2:49:24| to go out and live on a one acre lot when there's three units an acre right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| next door to them already you know I think as a body we need to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10168)|
| 2:49:33| affordability in mind I'm not saying cram everything everywhere but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| affordability and I think a half acre lot you know as Mr. Smith said is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10178)|
| 2:49:44| very generous in today's world and even in even in the area out there I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10184)|
| 2:49:49| again I love Cory's in and gives out there I get out there fairly often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10189)|
| 2:49:55| beautiful place but half acre is in my opinion the largest they should be from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10195)|
| 2:50:03| an affordability perspectives where we do have a housing crisis and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| gonna we're gonna we're gonna end up approving something that nobody's ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10207)|
| 2:50:10| going to be able to live in as my point Thank You Commissioner Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10210)|
| 2:50:15| Barger thank you I just want to reiterate what Commissioner Huber and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10215)|
| 2:50:20| Commissioner Overton said you know I teach a class at the University of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10220)|
| 2:50:24| Tennessee and when my seniors graduate they're having to move out of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10224)|
| 2:50:29| because there's not enough affordable housing for them so you know with with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| that being said I think that we do need more subdivisions and outlying areas you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10234)|
| 2:50:39| know whether it is people of my age that's moving kind of on the outskirts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10239)|
| 2:50:44| of town for a bigger lot or if it's for the retention of our younger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10244)|
| 2:50:49| professionals to stay in our in our city and you know help drive the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10249)|
| 2:50:54| so with that being said I want to make a motion to approve the rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10254)|
| 2:50:58| zone up to two dwelling units per acre it's all right we can I think we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10258)|
| 2:51:06| motion and a second on the floor but let's keep talking if that one we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10266)|
| 2:51:10| address it later okay so Commissioner Higgins yeah I think affordability is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10270)|
| 2:51:16| good point because for the average person the most expensive cost in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10276)|
| 2:51:23| life is typically your home and then secondly is your vehicle your form of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| transportation it is not affordable to push housing to the furthest points of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10288)|
| 2:51:38| the the county and make those who live there have to drive and invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10298)|
| 2:51:46| significantly more in their transportation to be able to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| to or from work to or from to or from shopping anything else that that's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10309)|
| 2:51:55| of the the reason why it's not a good long-term approach is and why it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10315)|
| 2:52:00| sustainable to keep putting subdivisions out in the middle of nowhere is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10320)|
| 2:52:05| we're forcing people to spend more hours driving and more hours or more more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10325)|
| 2:52:14| dollars more money on vehicle expenses buying multiple vehicles paying for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10334)|
| 2:52:20| gas the insurance there's a lot of costs associated with that so higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10340)|
| 2:52:25| and for the sake of more affordability makes a lot of sense in areas where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10345)|
| 2:52:32| also comes with the right infrastructure and not just you know road sewers but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10352)|
| 2:52:37| also shopping infrastructure working for the fact that you know the short commute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| shorter routes to leisure and third third spaces so that that's a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10362)|
| 2:52:51| I think that the affordability is a very important aspect here and no matter how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10371)|
| 2:52:56| cheap these are it's still going to put a tremendous burden on anyone who lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10376)|
| 2:53:01| there to have to you know spend all the money in transportation so yeah thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10381)|
| 2:53:10| you let's see Commissioner shell so thank you yes a commissioner Logan kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10390)|
| 2:53:15| of stole one of my points and I was gonna make about and it isn't all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| affordable because you put a strain on some of the roads in people's time but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10400)|
| 2:53:25| another point I was gonna make is you know every property has a zoning right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10405)|
| 2:53:32| we look at them all day when you buy a property you know what it is zoned you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| do not have a right to change your zone you can apply and this body hears it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| this body is responsible for evaluating what our plans that we've adopted over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10423)|
| 2:53:50| the years how those fit potential reasonings fit within those plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10430)|
| 2:53:57| you know just because we get an application that someone wants to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| something does not mean we have to meet them halfway necessarily or give it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10441)|
| 2:54:07| to them or say that this is gonna bring housing prices down by building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10447)|
| 2:54:14| something at the edge of the county so I mean just kind of keep that in mind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10454)|
| 2:54:17| we are supposed to evaluate our plans that we've adopted and the part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10457)|
| 2:54:23| advanced Knox you know this area of the county is they've spoken and three units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10463)|
| 2:54:29| an acre of urban sprawl is not what they want they've said that so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=10469)|
