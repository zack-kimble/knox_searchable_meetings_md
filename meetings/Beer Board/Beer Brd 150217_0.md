| 0:06:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| And we also have a problem with the fact that this is too close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| to the Lutheran church there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| I have a screenshot I took from KGIS showing it to be 302 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| Well, that's not what the measurement was from engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| so we have to go with that measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| So for that reason, we cannot offer you a permit for the consumption of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| Now, the other permit is for manufacturing, and what do we need for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| For the manufacturing, we also need the building inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| This is in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| So?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| I'll move to approve on the manufacturing end of the pending file documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| We had some lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| I'm going to ask Mr. Frost to tell us what we do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you, Chairwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| I contacted MPC yesterday on their certificate of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| It indicated with the zoning, a brew pub was appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| but they did not indicate whether or not C3 allowed manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| like this gentleman is seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| Five minutes before the meeting started, I checked my email again at the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| and with the weather, I guess MPC was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| So I don't have an answer from MPC if the C3 zoning permits what this gentleman seeks to do in terms of manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=465)|
| 0:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| They allow an on-premise brewery, but not a brew pub?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| Under C3, he would be allowed to do a brew pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| He has a distance issue, as mentioned, and he can seek a TABC permit if he wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=489)|
| 0:08:17| But the packet does not indicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| The packet of information that contains the certificate of zoning from MPC only indicates that they looked at it as a brew pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=501)|
| 0:08:29| It doesn't indicate if they looked at it in terms of manufacturing beer on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| But a brew pub, by definition, manufactures beer on the premises, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| It's got a tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| I'm not familiar with the definition of a brew pub off the top of my head, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| I'm sorry, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| It wouldn't be a brew pub if you weren't making beer on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| But you're not going to be able to have the pub part there because of the distance issue from the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| And I would also like to, if I could request moving this to the March 17th issue, I would like to have a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=545)|
| 0:09:16| I still believe that the church is over 300 feet, and I would like to have it surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Well, the engineering department will be the one that makes the determination regardless of the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| and we will be real clear on this other part about the brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| I wanted to ask Mr. Frost, if I may, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| What's the definition of the actual building to the church, the corner of each property to each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| What is the standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Well, it's ordinance section 4-66A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| and it is 300 feet of any school building, any hospital, any church building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| or any funeral home as measured from building line to building line by the shortest distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| So it's a straight line from each of the buildings to the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| Church building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| It's not a sanctuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| It could be a fellowship hall or a gym, whatever the edge of the building is closest to these two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| Yes, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Is there any way that he can have like a meeting with engineering on site to confirm that one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| If he wanted to contact engineering, he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| He contacted us in June about this, and at that time engineering measured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| and he was made aware, I have a series of e-mails confirming this, that the distance was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| Was short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| And he proceeded to continue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| So I believe that we're going to, as you requested, do this on March the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| We'll have a beer board meeting that night, and we'll look at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| get another measurement to be sure that the measurement is correct for the brew pub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| and we'll also know for sure that the brewing part is okay in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| Whether I think it is or not really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| It's exactly what the ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| That's a fairly new ordinance, so this is why this is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| And I would like to meet with engineering before March 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| There's no reason for me to meet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| and waste people's time if engineering does determine that it is under 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| You'll need to call Ms. Day next week or later this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| and make arrangements for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| My second question, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| is there any possibility that a church can waive it since the distance is really close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| So it's an absolute, we'd have to change the ordinance in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| There is a state law that requires municipalities to have that 300 feet distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| So I looked at letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| I looked at, you know, as many things as possible because it was close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| But the case law is very specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| and the state legislature law is very specific, 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| We've had this come up several times recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| It had to come up in Market Square, but it was kind of different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| That's different because that zoning is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| And I know he talked about trying to expand the CBID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| and then he got into a tax issue there because the permit is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| It has additional taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| And it would work the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| And it would not only affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| It would affect everybody there, and they'd all have to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| The other thing is that if he goes the TABC route, it's a $5,000 application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| So I think he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| But he's interested in beer and not hard liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Because I asked him if his beer was 5% or less by volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| Is that the cutoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| That's the cutoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| For TABC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| 5% or less by weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Right, by weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| So anyway, he's okay with that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| So if he made a slightly stronger brew of one of his beers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| he could apply for the state permit, and that would exempt him from the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Is that how that would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| That's the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I thought it would be a good time to figure out what all this means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| since it's hitting the fan in this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| I appreciate your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| So I have a brief question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| If I go, and I've researched all this heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| If I go the TABC route, could I come to the March 17th meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| and get approved pending that TABC approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| If I've already applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| I think this beer board in the past has allowed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| Ms. Day or Ms. Dyer has been given indication from the TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| that this gentleman or someone else has put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| and is starting the process for their TABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| because at that point he'd be then seeking the 50-foot distance under 4-66D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=832)|
| 0:14:01| and he wouldn't have to have the 300-foot distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Counsel Mandela-Vopay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| That's the old way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Mr. Frost, just for clarification on that, I mean, we could approve pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| I don't remember us approving because the application had been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| A TBAC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| I think it had been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Ms. Dyer is, I think, nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| It's pending, agreeing with you, pending, not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| Approved pending the approval from TABC, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| So when he shows up at your office with the actual state approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| that pending gets taken off his record and he gets the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| We have done that recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| We're passing these up, I guess we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| I'm sorry, just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| We don't actually recall a situation where it's actually followed through to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| we've released a beer permit because a pending application at ABC has been satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| But we have reported to the board in the past that we have confirmation from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| that an ABC permit has been applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| And they received a beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| I can't verify that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| I can only tell you that we've reported to the board that we have verified with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| You've asked us in the past to verify with the state whether an ABC license has been applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| and we have reported to you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| So we can't approve pending until the application is actually underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| Is that what you're considering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Well, I can't see how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| I mean, it's just confusing to me, and if we've done it, then I was asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| But I don't know how we could approve a beer permit for something that's pending at the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| because what if the state denied and then we've issued a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| No, they don't get the beer permit until the pending requirement is that they have to have the TABC permit in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| Once they have that, then we're happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| Just clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| That's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Are you comfortable now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| I'm comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| So, yes, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Just also for clarification, too, if they do have the state license, the requirement is only 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| Do they have to serve food?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| What are some of the other requirements, if you have liquor and wine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Is there a seating requirement also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| Well, I'm not totally versed in the TABC requirements, but in the last ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| I am, if people want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Well, in the last legislative session, there is now a TABC permit that does not require the sale of food in a kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1001)|
| 0:16:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| There's no seating requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| There's no food requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| As long as you're brewing beers above 6.2% by volume and 5% by weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Now, yes, Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Do we need a motion to move this to the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| Yes, to March 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| If so, I'd like to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| For both of these, the items five and six on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| So we have a motion, a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| We'll see you on March 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| And don't forget to call this day to find out when you can know for sure what the distance issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| before you spend all the money for the TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1056)|

| 0:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| The next is the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1061)|
| 0:17:53| The Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| I reside at 8119 Greenwell Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1074)|

| 0:17:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1079)|

| 0:18:01| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Do you have the plan for server compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| All good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1090)|

| 0:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Anything you want to tell us about the Dogwood Arts Festival other than it better not be cold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| Well, we appreciate the support of our three-day outdoor art festival in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| and also our music festival in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| That's where these beer permits will be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| And there will be lots of publicity on all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Yes, Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Are we going to have bluegrass this year on the Market Square?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| We used to have competitions on Market Square during Dogwood Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| We will have a wide variety of musical acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| We have 42 bands booked for Rhythm and Blooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| and we have about that many for Market Square Art Fair weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| We'll have music of many varieties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| We will have music of lots of variety but not of a bluegrass contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Is that okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Just hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Just right on Union Avenue, and I believe, come on up and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1158)|
| 0:19:28| My name is Christopher Berger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| You want the business address, home address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| 513 Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Sergeant Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| The task class has not been completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| and neither manager has submitted for fingerprints or background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| What about Ms. Day and Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| We need a copy of the LLC, the building inspection, fire prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| This is in District 6, and they've not had the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Would you like to postpone it to the next year board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Madam Chair, I received a call from this group earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| and I'd just like them to explain a little bit about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| I think this might be a time where we need to make an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| This just right, but I don't know if you all have heard, it's recently in the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| it was sort of in there with that floor of closings in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| It's been purchased, I believe, by Mr. Berger or a group that you represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| and I think that recently happened, and it's been a tight timetable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| and that's why some of these things haven't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| But I wanted to give Mr. Berger the floor to explain exactly what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| and why the task class and that hasn't been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| I appreciate that, Mr. Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| We've met with some of the closing of this business came on a bit of a tight timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1249)|
| 0:21:01| So without giving you a whole lot of excuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| I would just ask that respectfully if we could simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1266)|
| 0:21:19| When did the sale take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| When did you take ownership of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| The sale took place about two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Are you currently operating it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| We are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| But you're unable to sell beer, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| And have you scheduled or signed up to take the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| Yes, we're taking it on Thursday, this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| I think they purchased this business two weeks ago, and they're planning on taking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1306)|
| 0:21:55| They certainly won't sell alcohol until they receive their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| I personally think, given the circumstances, that we should make an exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| and pass it pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| I think it's a great thing that they purchased this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| and are keeping it going in a lot of the downtown community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| and really all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| We're excited to see it stay alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Councilman De La Valle, and then Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| Commissioner Hunter, I understand the task class is given on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| so in a couple of days they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| But what about the fingerprinting and background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| I don't know whether you should answer that or this gentleman, but when is that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Is that done on a particular day of the week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| We schedule appointments Tuesdays and Thursdays, every 15 minutes, all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| So could I ask Mr. Berger, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| why haven't you had yourself and Mr. Busby in for the fingerprinting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| since that enables them to do the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| to make sure you have no criminal record that would affect your handling of beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| Well, I'm afraid that I was under the wrong impression about when these classes were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1383)|
| 0:23:14| Not the task class, the fingerprinting, where they do an actual search background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| Yes, I was under the impression those were one and the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| and they were done at the same time in the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| I called the number for the task class and got a recording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| and I guess it didn't outwardly mention the fingerprinting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| I assumed that that was one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| So my apologies for not being more prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Sergeant Hunter, can he have that done this week if they get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| Weather permitting, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Weather permitting, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| So am I right to assume, then, that there's been, since the two weeks that he has taken ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| that there's been task class as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| There have been two task classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Well, I mean, and I appreciate what Counselor Starr is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| but it doesn't sound like to me it's a tight timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| It sounded like to me it was a judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| You just didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| You knew about it, but you didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| I mean, I understand timelines, but that's one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| but those classes being available and you not seeking it out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| we haven't made exceptions to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| If we start making exceptions, then I think that we're going down a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| I understand that perspective, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Counselman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Running a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Vice Mayor Pavlis just took the words out of my mouth in terms of what I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| is if we do approve this, now that we understand more about the scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| and what's going on, that it is a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| And I think in the last year or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| we've made it pretty clear in terms of what we'll approve and not approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| if certain things were not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| And so I'd like to make a motion that we postpone this until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| Madam Chair, I wonder if we could take this up at a special meeting before the next council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| so that since we have a business that's working in a precipitous environment downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| we cannot take it up at a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I thought I'd ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Counselman Greve, is that an old light, new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| That was my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| So March the 17th, have all this done, come back, and you'll be able to get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1545)|

| 0:26:13| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, a certificate of zoning from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| fire prevention approval, and the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| I have everything with me now except for the fire approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| Jim Hunter from the fire department there called me and rescheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| We were supposed to meet up yesterday, and he called and rescheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| said he couldn't get out yesterday, and then rescheduled it for today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| and obviously, you know, we'll see what happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| So as soon as he slides out and does the inspection, you should be in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Next event is Preservation Pub, and there are four events involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1621)|
| 0:27:09| The first event is coming up here in March 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| and then two of the other three events, the dates have been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| We'll deal with that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| So name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Cullen Kehoe, 28 Market Square, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Mr. Kehoe has not been in for fingerprints or background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| but the task class has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| We need the plan for server compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| And then you have the ñ did you say that already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| And then the clarification on the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| So am I correct that the new date in June for the Scruffy City Festival is June 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| And then August 22nd remains the back-to-school bash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| And then October 17th instead of September 19th for Philtoberfest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| So let the record reflect those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| October the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| So, pardon me, October the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Now, missing the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| Fingerprints and background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Are we back where we were before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Back where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| A motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Will that be past the March 14th date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| That would be past the March 14th date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| When is the beer board, Miss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Is it March 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| March 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| I've completed the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| I just need to do the fingerprinting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| You elevated me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I'm just curious as to why you haven't done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| This is becoming so frequent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| and I'm just curious not to belittle you or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| just is there a flaw in the process or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| There's just a lot of this going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Quite frankly, it was my oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| I remember doing the task class at the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| I was in the process of getting our liquor permit for an adjacent business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| that I'm also a manager of, and I thought I had completed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| I thought I had got the fingerprinting because I went through all the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| with the TVAC, and it was just an oversight on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| I'm new to the management area of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Councilman Delevaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Just an inquiry to sort of clear something up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| If the TVAC has done the background checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| do we have access to that, in other words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| We do not have access to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Yes, Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Do you have different standards than TABC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| I mean, are you on the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| As far as I know, it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| It's just state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| We check for any convictions regarding the sale, distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| manufacture of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| That's what would preclude him from being on a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| So he would have had to have had something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| but since he got that TABC license, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| You would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| So when did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| When was the last time you had a fingerprint and background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| I have not been fingerprinted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| The background check was in December from the state for the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| My name is Bernadette West at 2320 Highland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| If we change a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| and we have a manager that has had those background and fingerprinting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| which I believe that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| but I don't know if it's something that you have access to right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| can we change the name of that and go with that for this permit application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| March 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Honestly, I'm not sure how you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Just thinking when it's advertised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| the people who are to be the owner or manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| it's part of the public notice that's given out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| and as Ms. West pointed out, if you put somebody new on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Sergeant Hunter hasn't been able to look at the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| I'm not sure how it can logistically be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| I'm sympathetic to what she's saying, but I'm just not sure how it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| Councilman De La Valle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| I expect the same answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| but let me ask if we could have a special meeting right before the council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| so that he doesn't miss the March 14th St. Paddy's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| I mean, what's St. Paddy's Day without green beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Well, we as a council have talked about special meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| and that when the special meeting is necessitated by someone's negligence, we don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| If it's our issue, then we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| All right. I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| That was what we all agreed to, took an oath in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| So we have three special events now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| We adopted this policy, and I feel like we sort of tied our own hands on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| We used to always approve these pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| They still have to do all the requirements for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| I think tonight we really have two examples of where we're getting in the way of good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| I mean, Just Ripe is a good business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| It was just purchased by Mr. Berger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| and I think that was just like they're going to be prevented from selling beer on March 14th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| if we don't approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| That business is going to be prevented from selling beer for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| I think this is another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| I think it's a good event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| It brings people downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| And this policy we've adopted is just tying our hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| and frankly I just don't realize, I don't really know how much good it's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| So that's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| I mean, I would move to approve the pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| Okay, we have a motion on the floor that Mr. Frost would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| I don't know if this is a possibility to try to help them out hearing what Councilman Starr is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| but is it possible that they could hire a caterer to provide the service that they're seeking to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2023)|
| 0:33:51| Someone with a license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Just throwing that out there as a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| For the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Well, the others, they'll have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Well, I mean, I think that that's a good substitute if there's no other answer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| I mean, it's obviously going to eat into the bottom line of the profitability of that event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| because the caterer obviously is going to take a cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| but that's for them to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| It's their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| But Ms. West, I mean, you're not new to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| You've been around here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| And I just, you know, it just frustrates me so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Believe me, it frustrates me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Because, you know, I agree with Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| When we had the initial meetings, I was opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Oh, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Oh, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| I'll let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| But to your point, Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| I think we have hamstrung ourselves here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| and maybe it's something we need to go back and take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| But I don't think we can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| If we do this one, and I would do it, then we've got to find Mr. Berger and bring him back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| It's not fair to do it on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| It's not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| In the very next case, docket number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| these folks get something that I wish they could get and do get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| I don't, well, anyway, but just being on the beer board for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2113)|
| 0:35:21| I mean, I think we've got a vibrant downtown now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| and we're all excited about bringing events, new restaurants, and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| And I think we're going to have to reexamine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| and not let people be getting away with things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| But I never did see the problem with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| I know it may have put a burden on the office for them to have to keep up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| whether or not they actually got the permitting or the things that they needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| but we're a service organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| If we have to do extra things, in my mind, to keep businesses flurrying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| particularly when we're trying to have a vibrant downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| then we've got to be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| We can't just be this, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| in stone processes that slows things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| It just shows to me that we're not a progressive town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| I don't know where Mr. Berger is from or wherever, but that word gets back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Don't come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Don't come to Knoxville because they're not business friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| They don't want you downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| They're not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| They're not going to bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| And that's the path that I see us going down, and I'm frustrated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| And I think that we need to be more flexible here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| But I don't know how we get you up and running for the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| and you saw the last gentleman just walk out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| He's got the doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Cash registers flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| He's doing business without a key component of his business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| So I think I would be, for one, in favor of another meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| to where we reexamine our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| They were good, we thought, at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| but I think it's something that we need to be flexible on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| and I think we should at least discuss it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| If we don't change it, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| But I think the discussion needs to go on, and I'll shut up about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| Okay, so you're asking for a meeting to reevaluate these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| I think it warrants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| I think that we've gone through a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| You know, we've been operating under it for a while now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| and I think that Councilman Steyer has rightly pointed out some things that need to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2249)|
| 0:37:37| I don't know if they're deficiencies or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Five members on this board will decide whether or not it's a deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| But I think we need, I, for one, would be for a workshop or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| to discuss further the rules that we put in place, and can we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2268)|
| 0:37:57| It's just time to reexamine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| I would like to say that I agree that you have set things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| You have a checklist that we are supposed to accomplish in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| and have available for us when we come up here before the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| and we knew that we had to have all this in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| I think where the problem is lying is that the board only meets once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| so it's these things that fall in between the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| Like JustRight has that two-week delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| and then we had something that we had thought was accomplished, and it wasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| and now we have to wait another month before the board arrives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| And so I do think that having, like, documentation pending final approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| in that in-between time would probably help a lot of us business owners to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| Because I realize you do have to have your forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| and you have to have everything in place in order to make approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| but it's that one month in between when we're just lacking our fingerprints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| and we have to wait a whole month to get those fingerprints approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| even though we can come in on Thursday and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Councilman Greave, you changed your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| We have two motions on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| We have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| The first motion is to postpone to March 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| We don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| We don't have a second for that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Now we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| We can't second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| I'll show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| He's behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| All those in favor of postponing to March 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| I'd just like to say a yes vote for this postponement kills this event for St. Patrick's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Unless they get a caterer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Unless they get a caterer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Mr. Frost, do you want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| Short of a special called beer board meeting or past spending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| if it passes, they might have to go with a caterer in order to accomplish their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| I think they could do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| I'm going to think aloud here, which is always very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| But we have two of these, a business and an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| And we've had a request for a special meeting from Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| And this board agreed a long time ago, well, not a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| that we would only have special meetings if it was not someone's negligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| Now, is there any thinking on the board that we might need to revisit that thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| I think it's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| You were fastest on the trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you, Mrs. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| I'm in favor of having a special call meeting to address these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| Because that is not, and that doesn't go against what we set and discussed and voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2463)|
| 0:41:11| as Mr. Pavlis so acutely said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Five votes decided that was our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| But we said that would be our intention is not to have special call meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| And certainly now I have a rash of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| But I'm in favor of having one before whatever our next meeting, March 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| I agree with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| I mean, I think that that's where we show that we are flexible enough to be able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| in certain circumstances, special circumstances, we can't do it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| But I don't want to see this event not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| And I don't want to see that other gentleman have to continue to go another month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| without an intricate part of his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| And people are coming to his business because he's new and he's not full service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| So I think that that gives people the first impressions are always the most lasting impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| And they haven't put their best foot forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| He made some mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| This gentleman admitted he made mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| I understand that he went before the TBAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| And if I was in his shoes, I probably would have done the same thing, just to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| being new to the area or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| So I wholeheartedly agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| The problem we got is how do we notify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| We have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Mr. Frost has a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I don't want to oversell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Mr. Dellavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Yeah, I just want to say, I think of the two policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| this is the one where we could bend a little bit and provide flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| It gives us the discretion to say, well, the circumstances are such that we can bend this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| I think that's better than changing the policy of get your fingerprints, get your background checked, done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| So I think that's a better way to have the safety valve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| We need Mr. Wallace and who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Counselman Greve to amend their motion so that March the 3rd would be a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| in which we would consider this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| And then we'll have another motion to deal with Just Right also on that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| So do you all want to amend your motion, withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| What do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Amend the motion to we'll hear it on March 3rd, just prior to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| A special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| A special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| So we'll see you on March the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| At 645.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| Now, the other one is Just Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| Mr. Frost, give us some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| That's already formally been postponed until the regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| Someone will need to make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| I'll make a motion to reconsider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| On March the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Now, a motion to postpone Just Right to March the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| And a motion to postpone the Preservation Pub to March the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Please have those prints and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Don't come back up here with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Should we go ahead and take care of the other events at that time also then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| We'll take all of them at the same time if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2656)|

| 0:44:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Mr. Cullen can leave his finger here and we can see him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2663)|

| 0:44:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Rocky Tops Piano Bar, 1901 Cumberland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| We need to move this along, folks, because we've got several things and we have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| done by 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2675)|

| 0:44:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150217?start=2679)|
