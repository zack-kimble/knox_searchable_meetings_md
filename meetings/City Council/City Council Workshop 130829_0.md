| 0:01:09| With a good mind and a good heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| We pray for all of those who are less fortunate in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| Thank you for our police and our firemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| Thank you for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| soldiers who are overseas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| These are the blessings we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| Well, let's pledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=89)|
| 0:01:47| Miss Wilson if you'll call the roll, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| Mayor Brown here. Councilman Campin here. Councilman Dela Vope here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| Councilman Palmer here. That's Mayor Pavlis here. Councilman Saunders here. Councilman stair here. Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=118)|
| 0:02:08| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| First off. I would just like to take a personal point for and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| councilman Wallace could not be here this evening and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| He has been involved in this process from the get-go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| It's just part of being a part-time legislator that sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| Things come in to play to where it's just impossible to make every meeting that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| But he was truly sorry that he could not make this and very upset that he couldn't be here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| And it's certainly not a reflection of him not being interested in this matter because as you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| He's been attending his attendance has been practically 100% at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| So with that being said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| We will start the agenda first. We're going to have to Nova to present for 20 minutes, and then we'll have the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| for 20 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| Yes, oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Okay, I'm sorry. Well, hold on one second. Let me just finish with that and then what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| On the agenda, we'll have three speakers five minutes each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| On each side and then we'll take it from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| From that point so I'll recognize councilman grief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Thank You mayor a couple of issues that are coming up at City Council on Tuesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| I want to report to my colleagues that I've been in conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| both sides of these rezoning issues both the neighborhood groups and the attorneys and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| what we would like to do and I will bring this forward on Tuesday night is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Town Center in North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| Rezoning we're going to postpone for four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| We just got the some information from the developer today, but due to Labor Day weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| It's going to be difficult to meet with the neighborhood and so both sides have agreed to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Also the Westland Morrell rezoning on the corner there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| We are trying to get the neighborhood groups and the developer together, and we'd like to postpone that for six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| And the third one which is the property on Dean Hill by Rufus Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| In working with them. They're looking at some possible changes there and would like to postpone that for eight weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| So everything that you took care of while I was gone is being postponed once again on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| So I just want to let you all know on that now a four-day weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Would you say it's now a four-day weekend there you go, so thank you colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| And all that is just a proposal, and we'll have to deal with that in an official vote come Tuesday evening so with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=278)|
| 0:04:47| I'll turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| To know what you've got 20 minutes starting now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Great, thank you very much. My name is Melanie Robinson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| I'm a VP of business development with to know the health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| And I appreciate the opportunity that you're giving us to explain our project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| And we'll be talking about not only the details of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| But also some of the decision-making that went into the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| And hope that we leave you with a good understanding of where we're coming from as an organization relative to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| Physicians Regional Medical Center also known formerly as st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| Mary's Medical Center has a very long and rich history here in the Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| It's been around for over 80 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| It was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1930 and that established a culture of compassionate care that we believe is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| unequaled in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| We have a very clinically excellent hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| We have the most highly ranked joint replacement program in the state of Tennessee in terms of quality measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| We were designated by Aetna as a healthy baby site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| We're not talking about a hospital that is in distress either from a clinical or a financial standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| But we are a clinically excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| architecturally challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Facility our facility dates from in the original structure. It was built in 1930| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| It was added to through the decades until the 1990s. It's extremely difficult to access and navigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| we have done studies of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| Challenges around how could we reconfigure the facility in order to meet the needs of health care in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| I think we all know you can't pick up a newspaper or watch a news report without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| Seeing that health care and the way that we deliver health care is changing and it's not the same as it was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| 1930 or 1940 or 1960 or 1980 and we are trying to position ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| To be ready to meet the challenges of the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| We have a great hospital today, but it cannot serve us the way that it has for the next 80 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| So we're trying to make sure that we're ready for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| Just to give you a visual the next slide is just going to show you the facility today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| It's difficult to see out here because it's a little dim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| But those of you who can see it on your screen, you're gonna see facilities that are put together on a hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| Very hard to find your way around as we look at sick patients trying to make their way through the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| This is a one and a half million square foot building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| And as we look at how health care is changing it's becoming much more ambulatory in nature driven by outpatient visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| Shorter hospital stays people don't have a week any longer to learn their way through the hospital. They're in and out very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| Access is key and efficiency is key. We're being paid in different ways than we were in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| We're driving toward quality models efficiency models low cost high quality and as we talk about our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=457)|
| 0:07:46| Transporting patients around a facility like this getting supplies from one end to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| This is a very challenging situation and it will get tougher for hospitals not easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| The other key component in in this decision-making process is the relationship that we have with our medical staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| Physicians and hospitals work synergistically together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| Not all physicians are employed by hospitals. In fact, most are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| Physicians decide where they want to treat their patients and physicians are voting with their feet on our campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| unfortunately over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Couple of decades. We have watched a gradual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| Emptying of the physician office buildings on the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| So physicians even if they're still doing surgery there many of them no longer practice on the hospital campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| And there's a list of the specialty groups that have actually left the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| To do their business elsewhere and to take care of the patients elsewhere in from an office standpoint. So again, we're still a busy hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| But our physicians have clearly communicated to us that they need a different solution that will help them stay competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| Not just the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| So we looked at a number of alternatives when health management purchased Mercy Health System from Catholic Health Partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| We knew we had known for a number of years that we had this challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| Looming up ahead of us and we had we had done some initial analysis of how to resolve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| but health management's commitment when they purchased mercy of a minimum of a hundred and eighty million dollars of capital to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| Invested in this community over the next five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| We knew that we had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| To make the right decisions for the long term for the health system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| And so we looked at four different options. One was just the status quo continue to do what we're doing at Physicians Regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| Frankly that is not an option. That's acceptable to our medical staff and that is an option that leads to a very bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=577)|
| 0:09:46| scenario in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| We are gradually going to see a deterioration of that hospital that is going to be financially unsustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| And it's going to wind up in a very bad situation both for that neighborhood and for Knoxville itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| Hospitals help drive the economy of this area and we want ours to be strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| So we want to we want to tackle this problem while we're still strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| Status quo plus was to try to do refurbishment or additions a new tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| Some sort of solution from a facility perspective on the current site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| The the next option that we considered was a phased move of the facility essentially up to our North Knoxville Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| I do want to remind City Council that while there's been a lot of discussion of to Nova abandoning North Knoxville to Nova has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| Invested about a hundred fifty million dollars in North Knoxville at North Knoxville Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| So we looked at could we move our services to North Knoxville Medical Center and make that our tertiary medical center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| Which would still leave the Physicians Regional campus that is in place today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| Looking at the same kind of situation that we're considering here and then replacement hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| which is to build a replacement hospital in a location that best meets the needs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| Our patients that come to us not only from the neighborhood around the hospital, but from an 11 County region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| While leaving some level of health services at Physicians Regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| So this is a very simple view of a very complicated decision-making process that we undertook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| But when we looked at the the real factors that drive our ability to meet the needs of our patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| To meet the needs of our physicians and to be successful as an organization both financially from a patient satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| standpoint and in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| We looked at these key drivers and what we saw was that the status quo option really doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| The status quo plus option really doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| The phased move north is slightly better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| But really doesn't work and solve the fundamental challenges that we have and that a replacement hospital is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| Solution that we believe will carry the health system into the future and for the next 80 to 100 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=716)|
| 0:12:05| So as we considered a replacement hospital we looked around we found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| 107 acres we acquired an option on that acreage on Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| For a potential replacement hospital this location is very attractive to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| It's attractive for a number of reasons first of all it is very accessible easily accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| From the travel routes that go both north and south as well as east-west and that touch the 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| 11 counties where our patients primarily come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Advantage to that piece of property is that it's directly across the street from where many of the physicians on our medical staff had already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| Chosen to move their offices, which is the Dow Springs development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| This actually keeps the cost of the development more reasonable we have to build less medical office building space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| Because many of those physician practices are already co-located next to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| So where are we now of course as you know we're in the middle of the rezoning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| We have additional approval processes after this stage rezoning is just step number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| Then we go through use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| And then there's a state-level review process which I know all of you are familiar with which is the certificate of need process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| Where we will have to demonstrate that there's a need for this project that it's economically feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| And that it's in the interest of the orderly development of health care those are high hurdles to cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| We've looked at this project. We believe that we meet those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Requirements, but there's a whole nother body that will look at that in great detail after this rezoning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| This is just phase one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| Architects and engineers have completed site analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| They have completed initial building plans many of you have seen what their work has been to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| And we've solicited a lot of input from key stakeholders, so let's talk about the site just for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| This is a little hard to see up on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| But as most folks here have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| This is a conceptual rendering of the hospital as it will lay on the land the really key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| points here of the land and the and the layout of the property are that we are building as close to Middlebrook Pike as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| Can as is feasible we're building as far away from homes as is feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| There's a creek running through the middle of the property and as you are aware at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| We've asked you to consider rezoning of the property that is closest to Middlebrook Pike on the north side of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| The north side of the creek is currently zoned agricultural as is the south side of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| We're asking for o1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I would like to point out and we have maps up here for the one year and the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| I'm not going to sort of bounce in front of them, but o1 is already one of the approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| Zoning uses for the property on the north side of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| We're asking you to rezone the north side of the creek in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| Keeping with the one year and the sector plans that you have already approved as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| We think it's an appropriate use for the space as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Look at the next drawing what you'll see is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| The property that we've selected is really part of what is already a significant medical development a medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| Node if you will Dow Springs across the street the the word the letters there MOB stand for medical office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| There are significant numbers of medical office buildings. There's a proton therapy center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| The one that that's a little out of keeping with that is the very large FBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Office that's at the top of the hill there, but we're already in a medical node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| So as we look to staying on that north side of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| Which is already again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Appropriate usage been designated through the one year and the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| We're simply asking for rezoning that's in line with that use that was already deemed an appropriate way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| To move forward with development in this part of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| The 44 acres which are on the south side of the creek will remain zoned agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| There will be no changes there, and we'll talk about those 44 acres again in just a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| so in keeping with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| Our goal here to listen to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| stakeholders both our Board of Trustees our medical staff as well as community leaders and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| members of the communities that are impacted by this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| we have participated in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Great number of neighborhood meetings both in West Knoxville and North Knoxville about 13 of them at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| We've met with city officials. We've met with a lot of interested parties, and we have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| People's concerns. I think we understand what those concerns are and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Working diligently to do everything that we can to have this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| Address those concerns in a way that meets the needs of all parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| We understand those primary concerns to be traffic noise and lighting water drainage some environmental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| Will there be appropriate resources for the neighborhood and then of course significantly what will the impact be to the existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| hospital area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| So let's just take them one by one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| concern of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Increasing neighborhood traffic in West Hills we know already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| That there is an existing traffic problem the hospital will not create a traffic problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| But the neighborhood has certainly strongly expressed and we understand the concerns relative to traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| We were required to do a traffic study for Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| And it indicates that the additional traffic that will be generated by the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Can be managed by making some changes to Middlebrook Pike that include acceleration and deceleration lanes coming into and out of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| adding a left-turn lane into the hospital entrance and then adding a traffic light at Dick Lowness Lane and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| synchronizing those traffic lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| One of the things that our traffic engineer noticed in as part of that study is that the traffic lights today are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| Synchronized properly and that synchronizing those traffic lights will help that flow of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| That's what we were required to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| But we want to be a good partner with the neighborhood and so we've communicated with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| Repeatedly that we are very interested in working with them as as they see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| solutions to traffic issues that make sense and that would work for the neighborhood that we'd be interested in partnering with them to come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1104)|
| 0:18:32| The city and talk about those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| It's become clear through the course of those discussions that it's difficult to reach a consensus as to what those solutions may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| And we need some expert assistance. So to Nova has gone to the mayor's office and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1119)|
| 0:18:47| With the help of Christy Branscombe and Dwayne Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| We've gone to the mayor's office to propose that we jointly expand the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| That we look at the neighborhood streets that will be most impacted and that we do that in partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| We're waiting for a response for them from the mayor's office and we'll know about that soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| But we we are prepared to work together toward finding solutions that make sense for the neighborhood and that we can agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1146)|
| 0:19:15| noise and lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| couple of things here the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| The when the architects who are very good architects and have a lot of health care experience first came to us with the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| the first thing that the hospital CEO said was you got to flip this hospital and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| The architect said I don't know. I don't know mark. He's great architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| But he said I don't know if we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| We went to some neighborhood meetings and the neighborhood members said we don't want an ER by our houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| we don't want to your helipad by our houses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| We came back and said well Karen had a good idea, but the neighborhood reinforced it and we listened if I minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| Okay. Thank you. I'll hurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| So ER has been flipped to be as far as possible from the surrounding homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| There's over a football field of green space between the homes on the west side of the property and the closest parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| There are two to three football fields of distance to the closest building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| Lighting will be the latest technology that will direct the lighting to where it's needed and not encroach on surrounding areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1208)|
| 0:20:16| Next line drainage environmental concerns. We're required to meet the stringent stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| Requirements and we will do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| 44 acres of the property will remain zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| Agricultural we have entered into initial discussions with Legacy Parks Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Regarding the feasibility of placing a conservation easement on those 44 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| We don't have a final answer on that yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| but we think that could be a very good solution for a way to preserve a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| Significant amount of green space in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| In a way that creates a great relationship between the hospital and the neighboring areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| We've also reached out to the City Parks and Recreation Department to propose that the walking trail through the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| Connect portions of the Greenway, which is one of the projects that the city is currently working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| Impacts to North Knoxville, and this is a very significant question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| And I know that there are a lot of people who are very concerned about this. We are too. We love that hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| We've been in that neighborhood for 84 years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Planning is actively underway to reconfigure the services that will be available at what is today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| Physicians Regional Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I wish that we had more concrete answers about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| But we don't and as you can imagine this is a very complicated planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| We're reaching out to a number of potential partners around both those health care services as well as non health care related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Administrative offices that could be located at that facility and the way that we deal with the facility itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| Will be heavily driven by the types of services that were able to engage there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| Part of that planning process is highly dependent on being able to move forward through a timeline and not be delayed indefinitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1314)|
| 0:22:03| indefinite delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Create more challenge around resolving the challenge for that campus rather than making it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| It makes it significant significantly harder, so quickly. I know I've got about two minutes left, okay great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| Let me just talk to you a little bit about our timeline, and you'll see this on your screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| You have a handout of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Essentially what this says is that we received the commitment for a minimum of the hundred eighty million dollars of capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| Starting October 1st of 2011 we went through an internal planning process that was significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| That has resulted in obtaining the option for this property as we work through these processes including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Certificate of need process and construction process. We think we're right at about the right point to be able to utilize those funds in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1366)|
| 0:22:55| 2016 we want to use those funds in this community. We don't want to send those funds outside of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| This is phase one so we would ask you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| Let us work through phase one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| We're committed to finding the right solution for the existing physicians regional campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| We are highly committed to being good neighbors, and this is just the first step in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1401)|
| 0:23:35| You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1415)|
| 0:23:44| Have 20 minutes, okay, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1424)|

| 0:24:05| St. Mary's Hospital with a new one on Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Some of them are here today. I would like to ask them to stand up now and be recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1448)|
| 0:24:20| Thank you, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| I believe three of them are going to speak later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| My purpose is to tell you why the Middlebrook property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Should not be rezoned from the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| agriculture one or a one zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| To an office one or o one zone to build a hospital and that's the reason for the rezoning to build a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Tenova does not need to have the Middlebrook property rezoned in order to build their hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| The current a one zone permits hospitals as a use on review just as the proposed. Oh one zone does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1489)|
| 0:24:57| This is from the zoning regulations for a one general agricultural district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| section C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| It reads the following uses may be permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| item number one a cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| airport camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Sanitarium and it goes on to list some others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| further under article 5 supplementary regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| Tenova would be permitted to exceed the a1 height limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| section 5 paragraph B says churches schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| sanitariums and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| may exceed the height limitations of the district if and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Then a formula is presented that says that the setbacks have to be increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| As the building exceeds the permitted height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| The formula is one foot of increased setback for every two feet of height above the minimum or maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| Which is 35 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Given the setbacks on their conceptual plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| That would not appear to be a hardship for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| There are no other a1 rules that inhibit them from building what they've described so far as their intended facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| setbacks lot coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Accessory buildings and the like are substantially the same as o1 rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| therefore council does not need to vote on this issue if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| Tenova will withdraw their rezoning application and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Proceed to the MPC for a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| under the rules of the of the current a1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| If you do vote on the rezoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| know that a rezoning will inject the city of Knoxville into the certificate of need process a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| Rezoning can be portrayed to the Tennessee Health Services and Development Agency as city support for the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1609)|
| 0:26:57| The certificate of need should be decided on the criteria set forth by the agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| Without the silent hand of an unnecessary zone change pushing the committee toward approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| Third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Council should delay any vote on rezoning until the situation with tenova's parent company health management associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| HMA is settled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| as you know HMA now has a new board of directors picked by Glenview capital a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| New York hedge fund that was recently voted in by HMA shareholders as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| The single largest HMA shareholder Glenview argued that the old board was inadequate in creating shareholder wealth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| Because it made bad strategic decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| They specifically targeted HMA's decision to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| 532 million dollars to purchase Mercy Health as part of a quote weak strategic vision and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| specifically as quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| non-strategic located outside HMA's core geographic footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| Endquote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Will this new Glenview selected board agree to spend another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| 250 to 300 million dollars to build a new hospital in the same area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| Prior to the installation of the new board HMA reached an agreement with community health system CHS to merge the two companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1695)|
| 0:28:24| Now Glenview is balking at the agreed-upon price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Seventy percent of HMA shares must be voted to accomplish the merger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| How will it affect Nova Knoxville plans? Will it even happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Both HMA and CHS are under federal investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| How will those issues be settled and what impact will it have on to Nova's plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| The point is that there's so much uncertainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| It would be irresponsible for for council to vote to rezone land for a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| That may well be nothing more than a mirage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| fourth a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Rezoning must be done according to certain standards listed in article 7 paragraph e item 1 of the Municipal Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| There are four standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| Ask you to focus on just one of them item C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Which reads the proposed amendment, which is the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| Shall not adversely affect any other part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| Nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| The demise of a neighborhood hospital that serves the northern section of our city is an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| The associated economic impact on North Knoxville businesses is an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| The injection of an unwanted and unneeded hospital into West Knoxville between four nearby hospitals is an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1783)|
| 0:29:51| The impact of cut-through traffic into West Hills and surrounding neighborhoods is an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| The further congestion of Middlebrook Pike and connecting streets and roads that are used to transport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| 1,800 schoolchildren to nearby West Hills Elementary and Bearden Middle School is an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| The intrusion of a 100-foot tall building operating 24-7 on a quiet residential neighborhood is an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| The noise and lice from sirens helicopters deliveries construction and more is an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| The loss of the last large piece of habitat and open space in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Along with potential environmental impacts like increased neighborhood flooding is an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| For all the reasons I've stated the lack of any need to rezone the influence of rezoning on the certificate of need process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| The unsettled status of to Nova's parent company and the failure to meet standards for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| Tenova should withdraw its application to rezone if it doesn't council should vote no on the rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| Finally, I ask you to stand with us the residents the people who voted you into office who live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| Work here are retired here who aren't going anywhere who pay taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| Not with a company based in Florida effectively controlled by a New York hedge fund and soon to be maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| merged with another company from Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1879)|

| 0:31:34| with unmistakable and powerful voices of opposition at a West Hills Community Association meeting in July and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| With countless communications with council that we don't want or need this hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| Stand with us and say no to this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you for your attention and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1909)|
| 0:31:58| All right, keeping with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| Agenda, we'll go to three presenters up to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| five five minutes each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| I would like to ask two physicians from our medical staff to present. So we just have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1931)|
| 0:32:28| Your name and address for the record, please and you have up to five minutes. Thank you. I'm Leonard Brabson. I live at 517 Cherokee Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1948)|
| 0:32:36| I've been a citizen of Knoxville lived and worked here all my life except for three years in Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| Which wasn't a nice place to live, but have lived in Knoxville for 65 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| I've worked at the old st. Mary's and most of us still call it that by the way. I've worked there for 35 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| I deliver babies. I'll be back over there till midnight tonight waiting on another baby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| I've been in that hospital probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| Probably 300 days a year out of the lab out of any 365| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| Daily the last 20 years. I've been the medical director of the women's pavilion. That's where we deliver babies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1988)|
| 0:33:17| I've probably delivered some babies in this room. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| Hope you all turned out. Okay, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| Was sad to see like a lot of us the old st. Mary's name go I was there 35 years ago and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| But over the last few years the doctors had faced several disappointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| the old system was lacking capital and because of that money being spent on our upkeep or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2020)|
| 0:33:49| Just painting and doing things that should have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| Just didn't get done as much as they used to before and then we went through three or four major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| plans of what would happen what might happen and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Like everyone else when HMA came in the picture all of us were a bit apprehensive about what that would mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| But what it's mean for me is I still deliver babies every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| The nurses I work with still work there every day doing their job and the physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| I work with day in and day out still do their job. Yes. It's true. A lot of them have moved their offices to other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| It's pretty inconvenient for me and if you're nine months pregnant coming to my office and have to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Parking garages away to come see me. It's a bit of a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| It's been a challenge for physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| If I go to from my office to the women's pavilion where I go to deliver babies, I go on three elevators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| Hopefully none of them are malfunctioning when I'm in a rush to go deliver a baby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| If someone asked me how to get to the cafeteria from our women's pavilion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| I truthfully tell them it's better to get in your car go down to Broadway and go through one of the restaurants down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| Because you can't get there from here and that's just one of the minor inconveniences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| But I'm speaking to you from the physician standpoint because it's been said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| Physicians weren't in favor of this and I will say if there any of those around I've not talked with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| Not only are they in favor of it. They're pretty excited about the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Today David Harrell a surgeon friend of mine. We were sitting waiting for a surgery case to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| He said, you know, I live in West Hills and I understand everybody's concerned there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| but he said I think a hospital is a good neighbor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| But besides he's excited to go. We're excited to go and be there. I've seen the preliminary plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| I've been involved with giving advice about what they might look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| But we're excited to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| I will remind you and one of the other changes with HMA is we pay taxes now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| We're the only hospital in town that does that and I don't know the figure somebody at this table knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| But we pay lots of taxes last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| But to summarize I've been a citizen here all my life. I see this as a great change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| I understand people's concerns. Nobody wants to have something in their neighborhood. That's annoying. I wouldn't want that either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| But I think it can happen without it being that big of an annoyance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| Thank you. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2177)|
| 0:36:32| Good evening. I'm dr. Frank Barline. I live at 12204 South North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| When dr. Brabson guy here asking he wanted to go first or me and he said he had to go deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| so I get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Kind of sweep up the ends here, but what dr. Bradson said was absolutely true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| My main goal tonight is to tell you that I am actually a pathologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| I am a laboratory director of the Physician Regional Medical Center have been for the last 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| I've also been on the Medical Executive Committee for the last 12 years a couple years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| I was elected as the chairman of the Physician Leadership Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| Throughout this time we've spent a lot of time trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| What is the best thing to do for the patients the physicians for the for the hospital itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| You know I was there when we decided to build a north campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| And that had its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Criterion and its own goals to reach the problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| since we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Actually became the Mercy System five years ago, and then to Nova in the recent past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| The physicians kept saying we've got to do something the facility is just it's old. It's outlived. It's basically its life expectancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2256)|
| 0:37:45| You know laboratory for instance. We've got experts now. They're the size of this table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| We've got to put four of them in there that hospital wasn't built for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| That's just in the chemistry. We've got all kinds of other instruments. We've got a pen you've got radiology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| You've got CT scanners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| They weren't planned for when the hospital was built to all these things that are new and modern technologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| We had no place to put them the facility just won't handle it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| So we sat at the Physician Leadership Council primarily and we looked at the ideas that Melanie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| Voiced a few minutes ago about what can we do do we try to tear something down and rebuild it on-site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| Do we move north do we you know what what can we do and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| Through this discussion and and actually the little bit about the Physician Leadership Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| There's basically 12 physicians on that council and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| The job of that council is to represent the different specialties in the hospital we had OB we have anesthesia surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| radiology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Just on down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| And we challenged those physicians to say okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| We have a questionnaire and we develop some questions say go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| Talk to your relative your respective services your your groups that you're a representative of and come back with some ideas because we can't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| Do status quo we can't do nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| The hospital climate changes so quickly now. We can't just sit by and watch and wait and see what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| so we came back, and we just we had a discussion with administration from HMA and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| Basically kind of charged them said this is what needs to be done, and this is how we think it can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| It was it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| recently a physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| Initiative to say how about a replacement hospital HMA listen they went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| They tried to figure other ways came right down to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| The replacement hospital was the only real alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| And it was the only one that I will tell you of the 12 members of physicians on that committee who represented all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| services at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Everybody was in favor of it. There's 450 people on the medical staff at the Physician Regional Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| Those are co-mingled with hospital with doctors throughout the whole city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| Of the ones that are actively practicing there. I haven't talked to a single one yet who is opposed this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| They all think it's a great idea and like dr. Bradson said they're all very excited to see this happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2401)|
| 0:40:15| So now we'll go to you got one okay, that's it okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Am a B. Clifford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2424)|

| 0:40:29| part of West Hills and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Councilman Greaves district, I've been in Knoxville since 1981| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| I'm a neurological surgeon, and I've been in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Almost as many days and nights as dr. Brabson probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| We're on call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| 24-7 and I can tell you that from my house in West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| To any of the hospitals in Knoxville, and I've been on the staffs of all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| It's a 15-minute drive at the worst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| except for Tennessee home games and ice storms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| Now also during my time here. I've been chief of surgery, and I've been an officer of the medical staff at st. Mary's I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2465)|
| 0:41:13| Can tell you that st. Mary's has been a great hospital and in fact it was my hospital of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| To practice I had a fantastic operating room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Colleagues we had a neurosurgery center of excellence with our own ICU our own ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| But there were some very poor decisions made by previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| administrations which drove many physicians away from the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| Included among those poor decisions was raising the rent in the adjoining office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| So physicians left to find cheaper accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| When my practice had to leave that downgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| St. Mary's from a level two trauma center to a zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| So it lost all of its trauma coverage at that point and left UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| Hospital as the only trauma center in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| so a good administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| even without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Fancy buildings can make a tremendous difference and can bring physicians back in I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| Know that during the time I practiced there. We had state-of-the-art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| operating rooms we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| Rehabilitation taking place in patient rooms to bring them up to current codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| We had new services being developed such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| Rehabilitation such as women's services such as an outpatient surgery center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| So all of those things are in fact possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| The old st. Mary's has served many many people from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| North Knoxville Central Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| counties north of Knoxville in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| And we had patients coming down from Kentucky and over from Virginia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| to arrive at our hospital for care both emergent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| elective I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| sick patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Will find their way to a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| The several people have alluded to the complexity of the current building and yes, it is complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| But they have many volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| And they have transporters who obviate the need for patients to really find their way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Physicians were viewed as a source of income for hospitals. They were viewed as a source of patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| Then we had changes in the medical care system and all of a sudden physicians became viewed as expense centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2630)|
| 0:43:59| Now maybe things are turning back around and the hospital is recognizing that physicians do in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| bring patients in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| But I never had any patients complain that st. Mary's was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| Inaccessible to them and I had patients from all over Knox County as well as other counties and other states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Can speak very strongly from the standpoint as a neurosurgeon that these poor decisions by the previous administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2666)|
| 0:44:35| led to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| neurosurgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| leaving st. Mary's and that subsequently made it virtually impossible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| Neurology to practice at st. Mary's and I have heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| St. Mary's tried to make them cover three different emergency rooms have one minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| Thank you, which they said they could not do so they left I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| believe that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| Replacement hospital if in fact they feel it's absolutely necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| Could be somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Those of us in West Hills, and I noticed the other speakers do not live in West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| Feel that we don't need another hospital there. We don't want another hospital there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| It is a residential neighborhood, and we feel it should be limited to residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| We also feel that st. Mary's should not abandon its North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| patients residents and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| You'll hear multiple reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Traffic and noise the hospital can't control and they're both going to affect the quality of living in West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| So we ask you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| reject this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Request to rezone. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2755)|
| 0:46:03| Good afternoon. My name is John Neal. I think you all probably remember getting a letter from me. I have a photograph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| I'd like to share with you all if I may can I bring it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2769)|

| 0:46:51| When I'm in my backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2811)|

| 0:46:57| Old Weisgarber, so I'm doubly affected. I want to say first that I like dr. Brabson and dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| Brabson you delivered my first son about 34 years ago. You probably don't remember it, but he did turn out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| Okay, he got his MD a couple months ago, so he's your kind of kind of fella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| But I'm also going to say that at the time I lived out in Fountain City, and we picked dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| Brabson because he worked at st.. Murray's Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| St.. Murray's Hospital is important to the people who live in those North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=2847)|

| 0:58:49| Another source and not not West Hills Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| Within the West Hills Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Which is bordered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| by a boundary that was prescribed by the city of Knoxville Council in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| 1970s and it still exists today and we are a legitimate organization that is chartered with the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3544)|
| 0:59:13| And so my reason for being here is to tell you that we are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| Necessarily taking the stand as a community organization. Dr. Cleave is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| But I do think I should have the opportunity to tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| Now the other there are some organizations community organizations homeowners associations that are within our boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3569)|

| 0:59:43| And they are an organization that is immediately impacted by this to Nova project because they are Jason to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3583)|

| 1:00:08| We had a meeting with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Executive committee just last month and a vote was not taken at that time simply because there were too many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3610)|
| 1:00:18| different opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| But I would like for you to know that the that to Nova has come to our association meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| From as early as back in February and they talked with our executive committee and they talked with our general meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3626)|
| 1:00:34| attendance attendees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| They have done everything that they had proposed to do it. They've had one mess up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| That was where they had an opportunity to change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| significance of the scenic highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| That ran in front of where the proposed project is on Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| Now that was a little disturbing to a lot of people that live within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| West Hills community because that was a direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| Conflict with what they had told us they would do because they had stated that when we start this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| We will keep you totally informed. We won't do a thing that you don't know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| Well when the state legislature changed the designation of the scenic highway on Middlebrook Pike from Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| No from Weisgarber Road westward to about Whitehall. I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| No one knew about that. You're gonna have to wrap it up. Okay one minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| okay, well I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| Wanted just I wanted to say one more thing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| About the traffic that is one of the biggest issues that the Community Association and the people within the community are concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3706)|
| 1:01:54| MPC has a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| requirement for traffic studies and projects like this and I think that it's been alluded to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| Tanova has already asked council to exceed that by doing an in-depth traffic study that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3721)|
| 1:02:10| concerning the city streets within West Hills itself we need to know that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| It I hope that you all will take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| When you all are meeting and you have to vote upon this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3740)|

| 1:03:18| Of yet another hospital the problem that I foresee is that folks who live in counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3798)|

| 1:03:39| medical facilities with the exception of Methodist Hospital in Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| Therefore in most cases the people who live in these counties travel to Knoxville for their medical needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3824)|

| 1:04:31| Why not enhance the services at to Nova in Powell and make the needed updating changes at st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| Mary's instead of spending millions and millions of more dollars to build a new hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| I know of the excellent reputation that st. Mary's had for most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| Of the over 80 years of his its existence and with proper management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| There should be no problem of maintaining the fiscal health of the to Nova hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| It all comes down to proper management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| Also, keep in mind the number of people who live in north and east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3904)|

| 1:05:33| State Senator Becky Massey is quoted as saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Regarding the TPO vote. I am pleased because the process works when the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| We hope that you will apply this line of thinking to this issue. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3945)|

| 1:06:22| Give your name and address and you have three minutes. Thank you. Thank you vice mayor and thank you council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| My name is Robin Zalkin Brown, and I live at 8033 Hayden Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| It is in West Knoxville. They do call us West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=3994)|

| 1:07:06| you've got a problem because this is where those folks go and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| In most cases it's an emergency and as we've heard before time is very important. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4031)|
| 1:07:28| Your name and address please and you have up to three minutes. Thank you. Good evening. My name is Haifa George| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| I live at 809 Wesley Road. I am directly impacted by the proposed hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| And I want to talk from a couple of points. First of all, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| Recently delivered my 13 month old twins at the former Baptist West. It was an empty hospital had a great experience, but it was empty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| My father died at the old st. Mary's had a great experience there. They delivered fantastic care and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| The end-of-life care there was remarkable had no problem finding the cafeteria there either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| But what I want to focus on is jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| I've heard some talk in some of the newspaper articles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| From Tenova and I believe Senator Canfield as well talking about an increase in jobs and I have concerns there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| I have worked as an HR manager and director in a number of industries for over 16 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| I've worked in health care in the area. I've worked most recently at Oak Ridge National Laboratory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| And I have yet to see a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| Where you have this type of turmoil in a corporate environment with dramatic mergers and acquisitions acquisition activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| Where you do not see a loss in the higher paying jobs that you want to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| Construction jobs have been proffered as a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Positive job impact for this community and I would suggest that you take that off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| Construction jobs would be factored into a new facility or expansion of the silly at Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| They would be factored into the construction of the renovation of the existing st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| Mary's and yes, they would be factored into the Middlebrook property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| We have to take that off the table because those construction jobs, I think would be you know, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| They would be equal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| When you look at the 75 recent jobs that were lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| consolidation of business offices by Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| when you look at what other types of jobs are going to be seen as duplicative across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| New system. I think we have to be careful about looking at promises of additional jobs in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| And jobs are pretty big key factor you have right now, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| And I'll end with that, please. Please don't vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| Listen to the voters. We don't want this hospital. It's not needed. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4180)|
| 1:09:52| Brown thank you. I want to ask my question because I apologize. I'll probably have to leave this early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| And I want to ask miss Robertson a question on the status quo plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| Building a new structure where the existing hospital is. Could you give us some numbers on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| Cost of that I can I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Miss writer has done a great job. I think in organizing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| Communities around the existing hospital and we've met with that group a couple of times and have communicated this as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| I think there was a misunderstanding in those numbers that I'd like to correct here the 80 million dollars that was referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4228)|
| 1:10:36| Is strictly related to work that would need to be done on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| infrastructure for the hospital boilers chillers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4241)|

| 1:10:55| As we move into the future of new technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| So 80 to 90 million dollars of investment before you see anything that looks different in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4258)|
| 1:11:06| That's all behind the scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| And then you look at how do we take the facility and create something that becomes much more efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| That's very key. It is. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| It's about wayfinding and it's about sick patients trying to find their way around the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| But the real challenge is how do we become as efficient as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| And as we looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| We came away with between the 80 million dollars of infrastructure work that was required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| The challenge of how do you then do major?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Renovation in a facility that is your tertiary medical center. We're treating patients there all day every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4300)|
| 1:11:48| stopping our business to do significant renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| Takes us well beyond the capital costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| We've estimated somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred and seventy five to two hundred million dollars of capital that would need to be invested at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4322)|
| 1:12:02| But that doesn't take into account the business interruption that happens the interruption in patient care and our inability to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| To care for patients in our hospital. That is the key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| driver in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| patients and activity for our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Thank you, and I have one other question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| When you looked at other sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| And you sell it on the site on Millbrook as the best site. Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| Look at any sites in East Knoxville. We have no hospital whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| Haven't had one. Yes, sir. Did you look at any sites in East?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| side of town what we looked at as we looked at the sites and and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| Claim a little bit of challenge here and and maybe somebody from our team was involved in the in-depth going from site to site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| I wasn't involved in going from site to site so I can't tell you exactly what sites were looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| but as we looked at the plans for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Where where are the demographics of Knoxville where has they have the population shifted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| Where do our physicians want us to be where do they want where do their patients want to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| And as we look simply at the population that's required in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| maintain a hospital and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| The traffic patterns in our town run as we know from east to west from north to south to west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| And and so as we looked at those they were just not deemed to be the most feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| Area of town for a hospital the other key benefit to this site as I mentioned before is its proximity to Dow Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4414)|
| 1:13:42| Which does help us mitigate some of the cost of the development because there are many physician practices already located there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| That will then be right across the street from the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| Let me ask you what if you could share was what would be the number two site? Oh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| I did you have a number two don't don't have a number two site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| We believe this is the right site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| Yes, I know you you're probably gonna have to leave I think we're about to wrap it up anyway, but okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| The the physician that was the chief of staff is he still here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| The gentleman the neurosurgeon I've forgotten his name, and I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| Dr.. Kleefe off would you please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| I'm concerned because I think you made some good points and obviously you were in a position to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| To not only do your own practice, but to kind of supervise the practice at that hospital and so your observations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4470)|
| 1:14:37| I think are helpful to us, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| I'm confused because I hear miss Robinson tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| What she has and she has gone around to community groups and spoken to us and been very open about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| But there is other land near that property maybe not currently owned by to Nova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| But there are there are ground-level parking lots there are neighborhoods with small houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| Is there is there any inhibition in your mind to building a tower or separate new structure there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| Before they tackle the old building because we're constantly hearing the question that we can't renovate the old building. It's all a one-piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4505)|
| 1:15:14| With systems and whatnot can you see a separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| acute care unit being built there and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| Renovation taking its time next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| I just try to understand how that would work with the convenience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| Doctors need to use the right equipment and do modern surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Well, yes, sir. You make a very good point and I would observe that in fact st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| Mary's did build two out buildings if you will one is the Women's Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| And the other is a surgery center, which they built separate from the main hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| secondly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| rooms became antiquated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| some of those wings were turned into offices, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| Would suggest that a lot of administrators could be moved to offices in a different place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| That whole wing could either be raised or gutted and new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| Patient rooms or operating rooms or x-ray suites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Whatever was the highest priority could be built in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| And I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Leave you with a misimpression. I was not chief of staff, but I was on the medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| I was a medical staff officer. I was chief of surgery and I was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4589)|
| 1:16:36| Longtime neurosurgeon on the staff at st. Mary's and I'm still on the staff there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| Is a second question would be what type of equipment or management changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| Do you see that could make that hospital efficient again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| in other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4612)|
| 1:16:52| You said there was a decline in the last five to seven years as as as the hospital both lost money changed management several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| What would you see that that could be remedied that might?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| Return some of the viability that was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| In the past I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| administrators who were concerned enough about medical practices that they had lunch with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| physicians in the physician's dining room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| Interaction you're saying absolutely and I think that perhaps focus groups that would revisit some of these issues to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4640)|
| 1:17:29| where needs exist and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| How they might be restored would be very fruitful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| because administration really really lost its grounding and caused a lot of the problems which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| tenova has inherited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| And and the final question is I know others have questions is do you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| Physicians that you work with as being resistant to work in a location like that as opposed to I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| I understand the idea is they want to build a new campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| That's kind of laid out right at the outside and has got all the modern conveniences in the right spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| Do you see a resistance with physicians you work with in returning to a hospital that was upgraded in st. Mary's location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| No, sir. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Dr. Brabs and I believe related that there were 480 members on the medical staff and obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| No one has polled all of those members. I can speak to that very affirmatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| Perhaps some individuals have approached the administration with their specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| Wishes, but no one has polled all of the members to find out what their desires are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| I believe there are numerous physicians who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| Appreciate st. Mary's for its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Quality its integrity and its long history and want to remain exactly in that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4725)|
| 1:18:52| There are physician offices that exist around the property where they have bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| Property and built their own office buildings. So those buildings that are on the sort of periphery. Yes. Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| That's correct. So, you know, they would be far away from a new hospital in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| Okay. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| Councilman very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Thank You vice mayor a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| first of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| I want to say that I appreciate very much the civility between both the neighborhoods and to Nova and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| I want to come in both sides for the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| We have a number of zoning issues right now in the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| And this has been one that I think that both sides have been very open and I know I've been able to talk to to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| both sides the question I have and this is really to to know if I know that the architect is here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4780)|
| 1:19:48| Miss Robertson you were talking about the 80 million dollars that had to do with the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| That would be spent first and I think one of the questions I have and maybe the architect if that's okay can address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| have you actually done studies of the existing hospital in terms of what can and cannot be done and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| In terms of expansion if we begin to talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| one of the things that we wouldn't want to do is expand into the neighborhood and take additional properties, but if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| architect could if you could address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| That fact that you have looked at the existing structure and then also while you're working your way up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| Have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| developed actual plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| That we're going to be able to take a look at besides just a schematic site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| So if you'd introduce yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| I'm Mark Roland. I'm a principal with Thomas Miller and partners and Brentwood, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| I'm a UT graduate. In fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| Councilman greed was one of my professors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| Remember I got in trouble the last time you said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| We actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| Began our engagement with to Nova by trying to figure out a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4859)|
| 1:21:07| Reuse this campus and you can see on the image that's up on your screen that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4867)|
| 1:21:15| It kind of looks like someone took some dominoes and dropped them on the ground and they kind of went all different directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| It's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| I've been designing hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| almost 30 years now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| I've never seen one this dysfunctional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| The ORS are located two floors below ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| Underneath a mechanical room, which is underneath a plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| emergency room sits on the side of a hill and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| When we looked at ways to even separate if you go to the emergency room to today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| at physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| You find the ambulances and the cars. So what we call the ambulance entrance and the walk-in entrance are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| A shared drive and the reason they're a shared drive is because the hill is so steep. You literally couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4926)|
| 1:22:14| Locate two drives on that hill to separate the entrances. I stood out there and watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| a woman in a Lincoln almost back into an ambulance and so we almost had another injury that needed to be treated in the ED instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4941)|

| 1:22:30| They came for initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| It's very challenging. The women's pavilion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| At the south end of the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Dr. Brabson's comment about going to cafeteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| also means that the food carts coming from the kitchen to the women's pavilion have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| change levels multiple times multiple elevators that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| Get all the way from there to here and go through back corridors to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| It's a very long process to even get food from the kitchen to the women's pavilion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| The imaging department is in one of the oldest parts of the hospital. So the newest most high-tech equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| to diagnose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| Patients is located in one of the oldest areas very difficult to expand that area that would have to be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| So we looked at some options. We looked at how in the world would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| Would you begin to expand and renovate this campus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| we looked at an option to begin demolition on the north side and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| to move literally move the hospital south on the site and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| Make the access from Woodland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| It's very difficult it would require demolition of one of the parking garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| So it becomes initially a huge parking problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| Throughout the construction process things have to be relocated. It's very expensive the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| The boilers in the facility date back to 1954| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| They were originally coal boilers and they were converted to natural gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| Not very energy efficient. I believe your electric bill your energy bills are about three million dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| three and a half million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| That you that you have the sprawling buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| You have the multiple change in levels anyone that's been there knows that the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| Floor one is the floor one of the 1930s hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| From floor one you go down to ground level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Lower level one lower level 1a lower level 2 lower level 3 lower level 4 and then garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5078)|
| 1:24:46| Who named that I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| Then you go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| From there about nine floors. So it's a very it's a it's terraced on the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| it's very difficult to get from one area to the other and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| Beside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Poor family members that are already stressed that are trying to find their way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| It is it's a nightmare for the staff to get materials and patients from one end of the hospital the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| I'll pull my professor hat and it's obvious that you've looked at the the building from top to bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| What about as far as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Where where are you as far as schematic drawings that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| Not only us, but the neighborhood will be able to see in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| Where you are in the process for this camp for the Oak Hill campus, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| Well, well that one but also the new one the new one. Well, we have we have the drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| We're very close to having certificate of need level drawings, which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| block diagrams showing departmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Adjacency showing the massing of the of the building. We're very close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| We're doing the same study for the Oak Hill campus, we're just looking at options, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5154)|
| 1:26:02| Another another question I have if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| Tanova could share with us. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| Had asked about taxes property taxes that you vote. Can you share that with us? Not only property taxes, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5168)|
| 1:26:15| What you're paying for the property there on Middlebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Yes, this should show you this is what Tanova paid just the three Metro Knoxville hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| We have three other hospitals in rural counties in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| The three Metro hospitals paid over a million dollars in city taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| Four and a half million dollars in county taxes and five point five million dollars in city taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| So that's what Tanova paid for the three Metro Knoxville hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| Four and a half million dollars in county taxes and five point one million in state taxes in 2012 for a total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5203)|
| 1:26:51| over ten and a half million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| In addition to that if you don't mind to show the next slide Jerry, that'd be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| We did a quick calculation of just community benefit of the health system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| Here in Knoxville and when we look at wages and benefits paid this is just for 2012 as well as uncompensated care provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5224)|
| 1:27:13| At Physicians Regional alone, it's fifty eight million dollars of uncompensated care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| Total of ninety five almost ninety six million dollars of uncompensated care provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| So you explain that yeah, what that means is care that we provide that we're not paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5243)|
| 1:27:29| so when when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| We hear the statement. You're a for-profit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| Therefore you're bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| Really what that means to be a for-profit means that we are required through joint Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| Through CMS and other health care regulatory bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| We're required to meet the same quality standards the same care standards the same inspection standards as any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| Hospital in town. The only difference is we're the only ones that have to pay taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| Right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| Right and our charity care policy has remained stable from Mercy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| That was part of the purchase agreement with health management that our charity care policy would stay in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| And then I have one other question. Mr. Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| The neighborhood has brought up a lot of good concerns and questions, and I think you all have have addressed those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| And we'll continue to address those just like with the conservation easement and that sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| But one of the questions I have that they brought up which has to do with the zoning and has to do with the agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| Leaving it that way until you go through the process. What problem is that or will that be if the zoning stayed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| Agriculture and did not go to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5326)|
| 1:28:56| Great just making sure we had the right information there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| We have a medical office building as part of our plans so a hospital is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| But a medical office building is not we must have a medical office building adjacent to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5343)|
| 1:29:10| Thank you one more question. Well. I don't know who this would be directed to but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| I'm curious because the chart the pros and cons chart that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| have given us here about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| Or options the well yeah, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| About the doctors that were polled it seems to be some difference of opinion as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| To that question there absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| Dr.. Kleefe has made the point that he had not been polled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| There's a reason for that and the reason is that our physician leadership council as dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| Described managed that polling and they pulled physicians who are actively engaged in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| Currently working at the facility no dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| Kleefe it has a history of working with the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| But we polled physicians who are working in the facility on an active basis today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| Not simply based on their active medical status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| Which is a technical term of retaining specific privileges at a hospital well what give us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| What's the way you say technical so so people who are who are you can be an active member of medical staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5416)|
| 1:30:24| Deemed active by fulfilling certain privileging requirements credentialing as it through a paperwork process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5424)|
| 1:30:31| But dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Berline and you may want to talk about this for a second that group the physician leadership council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| Went out to physicians who they know do surgery in the facility this year now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| Who bring their patients to the facility who admit patients who do their work in the facility today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| So that's that's really that that's the group that was polled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| Do you want to address that is it all right if dr. Berline addresses how that was done? I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| Might be able to expand on that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| As she was mentioning the the true term of active medical staff just means you're you have active privileges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| As I mentioned there's 450 physicians on staff at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| A large majority of those are active, but that doesn't mean they ever come to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| You know dr. Cleveland. I know I've seen there twice in the last 12 years. I'm there almost every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| And I've talked with physicians who are members actively practicing at that hospital when we actually pulled the physicians as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5481)|
| 1:31:29| Melanie missed we we pulled the physicians in a committee that said you are the chairman of your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| You're the leader of your service line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| Go back to the physicians who practice at this hospital the ones who are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| Going to be the ones making a decision of whether they come or not and ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| What they what they think and that's what they came back to that meeting to the physician leadership council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| With those answers and those were the answers that have got us to the point. We are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| Okay, that makes sense to me then councilman grave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Miss Robinson we didn't get the answer on the cost of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| Yeah, sorry, I left that part out just quickly back on the physician portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| You do have a stack of letters that are letters of support from physicians who actively practice in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| So just wanted you know that you have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Cost of the property eleven and a half million dollars. We have not yet of course closed on that we have an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| I did do a quick calculation Jerry if you don't mind to go to the next slide real quickly a quick calculation of what and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5541)|
| 1:32:28| Is just an estimate, but what that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| Property would mean if developed in terms of estimated annual increase in tax revenue to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5550)|
| 1:32:37| And this is a pretty conservative estimate based on what is the what is the sale price of the land today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| The assessed value of that as agricultural would be a 25% assessment of the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| Estimated tax at the two dollar and forty six percent two dollars and forty six cents per hundred dollars of assessed value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| And then at a very low estimate of the cost of the facility two hundred million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| Assessed value at forty percent for a developed piece so looking at about a 1.9 million dollar increase in tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5580)|
| 1:33:07| Just to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| Thank you, and then if I may follow up with one of my one more question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| There's been a lot of talk about the fact that that both north and east won't have a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| What it's what is your commitment to st. Mary's north are you going to increase services there to where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| The people from the north other those counties coming in and then also how far how far is the north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| St. Mary's from st. Mary's central right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| North Knoxville Medical Center is eight miles north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| It started as an outpatient center started as a cancer center in 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| Inpatient services were added in 2008 and we have been in a sort of constant process of raising the tide of services that are offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5624)|
| 1:33:51| There it's been kind of an organic growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130829?start=5631)|
