| 0:01:54| First item, Madam Clerk, would you read the caption into the record please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| This is a resolution on the budget and making appropriations from the several funds for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| departments, institutions, offices, and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee for the fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| beginning July 1st, 2020 and ending June 30th, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| This is Resolution R-20-6-101-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| And Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Just a point of clarification, I have an amendment to propose and I wonder what the process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Does the item just read need to be motioned and seconded before that proposal or after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| or in front of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| Discussion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| It needs to be a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| We, I think the proper, we'd have a motion and a second probably on item number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| If your amendment would be an amendment to item number two, we could have a motion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| a second and then your amendment could be, and I'll look to the law director for confirmation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| your amendment could be part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Then we, I'm guessing we could probably have a substitute motion on your amendment to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| added to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| I'll look to the law director for confirmation on how that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| Well, if it's different than what this is, it would have to be an amended substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| If that's what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Or you could have a vote on whether or not to add the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Just a clarification with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| If you have a motion and a second, I could offer an, I could offer a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| to that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| To that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| And then that would be voted on, up or down, the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| I'll take the second then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| So we have a motion to approve item number two from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Commissioner Jay has made a second on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| And then I'll follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| And your follow up, I've recognized you with the first light with that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| I insist to introduce your amendment and I know I'm also recognizing Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| has got a light on too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=235)|

| 0:03:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| If you'll permit me a moment to offer some comments to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| This Monday night after our commission meeting, I completed my fourth ride along with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| Knox County Sheriff's officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| I can tell you each time I've been out with our officers, I'm more and more impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| with the team that we have at the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| It's clear to me that they have one of the toughest jobs in our county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| I'm amazed at the situations they're required to handle, the judgment we ask of them, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| commitment they have to serving our community and the passion they have for keeping us all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| In addition to the job they do every day during our viral pandemic, they've never taken a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| break and are dealing with an added level of health care in our jail and on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| While we can admire them for their dedication to Knox County, there are times I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| admiration is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| We have to show the members of our public safety team that we value them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| The health of our law enforcement team is at a critical junction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Not only is it a difficult time to serve in law enforcement overall, it's extremely tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| to recruit and retain the best in public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| The Knox County Sheriff's Office lost 86 officers since last July, with 72% of those resigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| to go to work for other neighboring departments or the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| According to our retirement office staff, 81 more officers are up for retirement in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| That doesn't even factor in the officers that we might continue to lose to other neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| departments or the private sector, both of which pay a lot more for a lot less responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| And to add insult to injury, there were times when there was a year-long waiting list to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| be part of a recruiting class of 50 or more officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| Now we're lucky to get to 20 to 30 applicants in a given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| And you heard from our sheriff, we have nine that want to be part of our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| Almost every officer I speak to continuously works two to three additional side jobs just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| This takes a tremendous toll on their families, their mental health, and their ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| focus on the community that they serve in a safe and professional way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| I've also talked to frontline officers that after years or even decades on the force are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| making significantly less than some entry-level administrative personnel, which just degrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| the morale across the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| To be frank, I could not imagine doing the job they're asked to do and to risk my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| every day for how little they make as professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| So hats off to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| It is definitely a calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| I continue to be amazed at some of the pay scales that we have and the value we've put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=387)|

| 0:06:33| I'm challenging Sheriff Spangler and his team to take a hard look at the entire force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| and how we compensate our officers and team members, but that'll be a much bigger project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| and a much bigger conversation to have in the months or years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| All that being said, I believe now is the time to invest in our frontline officers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| to show them how much we value their commitment to public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| Last week, Sheriff Spangler came here before us and reported that his department is under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| budget, under budget by $3 million in salaries and $1 million in benefits during this fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| And he asked to be able to use some of that $4 million in savings to reinvest into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Now, I know when the fiscal 21 budget was originally proposed, the financial picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| due to the viral pandemic and the shutdown seemed really dire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| However, we now know it's not nearly as bad as expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| We just completed an exhaustive finance committee report meeting where we heard reports and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| most areas appear to be on a strong rebound and numbers aren't nearly down as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| we had expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| They're down, but it is not a dire day in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| So Mr. Chairman and members of the commission, I formally offer a substitute motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| the fiscal 21 Knox County operating budget by adding a $1,500 bonus for 820 frontline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| officers totaling $1,642,665 and to be distributed during the first week of December 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=468)|
| 0:07:58| I have a handout I'd like to pass around as I continue my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| When you get a moment to take a look at this handout, it includes a breakdown of what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=482)|
| 0:08:15| bonus would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| It also includes an organizational chart for the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| The breakdown being passed around details the positions under this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| And as you'll see, these are frontline officers with ranks of captains and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| The proposed bonus isn't for administrative staff, the chiefs, or even the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| It's for the team members, many of who sit in front of you today who are on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| lines of public safety every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| My proposal also details timing this bonus for the first week of December, giving us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| more time for economic recovery and tax collections in the fall while also supporting the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| and their families before the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| In summary, I believe we can afford this investment in our officers and it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| be a worthy expenditure to support better retention and improved morale across the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| Thank you for the opportunity to present this substitute motion and this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| I hope it will receive a second and that you will all consider approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=550)|
| 0:09:25| Thank you, Commissioner Jake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Well, I have a substitute motion, but we'll talk about it a little bit later based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| the conversation we had about the million, but I guess, you know, to balance, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| to pass a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| And so, where does this, where do you take from to get to this 1.6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| My proposal would be to have it appropriated out of the unrestricted fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=586)|
| 0:09:54| We are currently proposed to use $12 million this year, so this would be added to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| I just need to take time to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| I mean, we got to, we have to pass the balanced budget, so we'll just have to look at it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Would Mr. Caldwell like to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=613)|
| 0:10:24| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| Yeah, we do have to have a second on this to put it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| I want to hear a discussion, I guess, before I add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| All right, I've got a second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=635)|
| 0:10:54| I think, ultimately, the amendment that we were comfortable with was the one amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=654)|
| 0:11:10| it by the new amount of the state dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| I would just disagree with Commissioner Jay from the standpoint of our revenues are better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| not in those categories that help the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| I mean, they're better for sales tax, which helps schools, but the categories of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| that fall underneath the general fund are not better, and we think they could get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| And so, that's why we were planning and proposing to use state money to help to pay for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| $750 raise that the mayor had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| I think, ultimately, you have a fund balance policy that also says if you're going to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| some fund balance, you've got to have a plan to build it back up as well, and so we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| to work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Okay, back to you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| I would just point out that the finance director had already mentioned using a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| of state funding for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| This is approximately $600,000 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| No, that is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| What I said was we were going to use $600,000 for this and $400,000 for cyber security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| because cyber security right now is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| Okay, well then, it's still $600,000 of the state money can be used, and we can, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| we can absorb that in our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| We have $62 million right now, and we, sorry, $62 million proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=759)|
| 0:12:47| Yes, I believe that I understand the fund balance policy, and I do understand cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| and what our needs are for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| It's part of why the timing is proposed for December, and I think we can afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| Okay, a question, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| I don't know where the votes are, but just a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| If this were to pass, would the original bonus structure that you all brought to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| was there were, I don't know what the right word is, some guardrails on that in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| of the timing of it actually being appropriated dependent on revenues later in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| Is that something that could be tied into Commissioner Jay's proposal if appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| I'm just, that was the first question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Yeah, I think what you would do is you would amend the budget on the expense side by his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| total amount, which I think was like $1,642,625.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| I think that would become the new general fund budget and the new gross net budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| And then on the revenue side, we would incorporate the number from the state money, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| $1,043,000 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| $1,043,542.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| And we would take that and do a portion for like $400,000 for cybersecurity and the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=844)|
| 0:14:14| toward the raises and then the remaining in fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| All right, we have a motion and a second on the floor for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| Additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| I think we all agree that the Sheriff's Department has done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| I guess what I have a problem with this is I think Mayor Jacobs, in good faith, sat down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=881)|
| 0:14:50| with the Sheriff and his team to try to see if they could work out a solution to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| our officers a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| And I don't want to put words in the mayor's mouth, but I think that's just the $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| that he offered was probably a minimum in that if in the fall our revenues stay strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| like Commissioner Jay seems to think that they're going to continue to go, then maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| there could be additional funds added to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| But to just kind of jump out and hit the whole thing all at once, I just don't know, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| we are in such uncertain times, I just don't know if we're going to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| And, you know, I appreciate the mayor, he could have just said no, we're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| And at least he tried to meet them halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| But I'm a little bit optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| I think that in the fall that revenues will be fairly good to where that probably we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| get back to that $1,500 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| But I'm just very cautious at this point to try to do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| Because we, I mean, we just went through a tough finance committee meeting and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| not a lot of sunshine out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| And so I don't know if the mayor wants to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| I didn't want to put any words in his mouth that the bonus potentially could be higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| That was exactly it, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Yeah, Mayor Jacobs, if you could please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| It would have, you know, we're looking at doing a minimum and then hopefully we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| So that was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| We've got a few other commissioners that wanted to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Commissioner Gill, Smith, and then Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| And I appreciate the discussion between the mayor and the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Speaking of the $750 budget, which is where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| But what is surprising to me is that we are not having a conversation about looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| the structural pay and benefits that you all are faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| And that, not at one point has somebody said, by the end of the year, we need to make some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| additional recommendations about structural pay changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| And I think part of the real conversation about how we can meet those needs is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| We can easily talk about a bonus for our officers, but we're not structurally talking about changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| the capacity for people to serve with the appropriate pay that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| It is the same frontline workers we need and depend upon for the safety and security of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1066)|
| 0:17:54| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| But we really do need to have a conversation about what that looks like long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| I have a clarifying question and then, I believe, a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Chris, Commissioner Jay, I want to understand where this money is coming from exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1092)|
| 0:18:22| So, I think the way I understand it, it would be you would amend the general fund budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1102)|
| 0:18:43| by $1,642,625 to $193,932,352 and your gross budget to $850,839,504.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1123)|
| 0:18:55| You would then incorporate the state money that we were anticipating, which is $1,043,542,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1135)|
| 0:19:04| and increase the unassigned fund balance by $599,083.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Where did we have proposed for that $1,043,542 from state funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| What now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| The $1,043,542?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Well, what we had proposed was spending $400,000 in cyber security upgrades and then the remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1156)|
| 0:19:26| for the $750 bonus that the mayor talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| Just to clarify, also in that state funding, you had $1,600,000 for Chaud Road, $1,200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| for I think you said remediation, but I couldn't quite hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| That's the initial $4.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| That's already in the budget book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| We spent that for capital items, which we thought was the prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| So, we are removing the cyber risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| No, no, I'm keeping the cyber in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| I think it's very important right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| I think it's extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| There should be more in there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| I think we're getting a good view of what that can cost in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1202)|
| 0:20:14| Commissioner Jay, you're proposing this on the assumption that we've had some pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| good news from April and that things are going to continue to improve and be rosy through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| the rest of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| I didn't say rosy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Well, it's going to be better than it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| Yes, everything that we've been presented from the state, from our own finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| from every report we've seen, in a month where the world was supposed to come to an end financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| It hasn't yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| And I pray to God it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| I'm looking at the complete body of information that has been presented to us over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| If it doesn't improve, if it were to get a second wave and we had to reel things back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| what would be the first thing you'd take this money from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| I'd have to look at that when the time came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| I mean, I don't like to do a lot of hypotheticals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| I like to look at the assessment that we have and the information we have at the time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| I mean, ultimately this comes down to, I just want to remind everybody, and I'd be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| to have the sheriff come back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| We have 81 more officers getting ready to walk out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| Anybody who has ever had a day of experience in business knows that it is far more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| and far more harder to get new employees than it is to retain your existing employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| So ultimately this comes down to hopeful promises later or action now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1305)|
| 0:21:53| I think we're at a critical point now where our team needs to know that we want to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| in them and we want to show them that we care about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| And we, as a community, as our commissioners here, have put that as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| This is not a normal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| This is an unprecedented time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Many of the things that I would have said here tonight, I would have said last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| I'll say next year, but this is a year above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| And every one of these people that you're looking at has gone above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| And this is a time when we need to say, don't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Don't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Stay and protect this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| And this is not tens of, twenties of millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| And I think that we can afford to say that to our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1361)|
| 0:22:49| I agree with you that we need to retain as many as we possibly can and do everything we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| I'm just not sure that it's a good idea to promise something that we may not be able to fulfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| I'm with Evelyn and I think John with the way we're going to approach this whole budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| and everybody is, we pray and hope that things work well and we can amend things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| And that's where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| I wanted to ask the Sheriff if, out of the number that he had to get raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1406)|
| 0:23:36| in terms of what we've been dealing with with the COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| and putting our officers, our men and women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| they're always at risk every time they go out in the uniform and have their badge on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| But of the 820 officers that are on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| are they all full-time employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| I mean, is there any, I mean, I just feel, I feel like we are in such a turmoil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1444)|
| 0:24:14| in our county and in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| Every officer right now is being targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| And I understand what Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Schoonmaker and I respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| our Mayor and all and I realize that all of our county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| and all the departments have had to make sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| My own family has made sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| They've put themselves out on the front line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| and have taken care of the patients that have had COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| So, I understand the stress, how hard it is for the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1490)|
| 0:24:59| that are married to the men and women and have the children and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| that are in our, wearing our blue, coming home every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| and not knowing what you're going to face when you get that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| So, it's so really hard for me to sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| and to not want to try to do everything we possibly could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1518)|
| 0:25:26| because I know how hard they work and I know how little they get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| and I know that they all work second and three jobs to even make ends meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| and they've not been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| Whereas, you know, I don't think there were any of our county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| they got furloughed, but they still got a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| And all of them went out on the front lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| dealing with what these men and women are dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| Is there any numbers of the men and women and correction officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| the ones that have been through the academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| would there be a huge number subtracted from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| from those that really have been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| where it would even benefit to, in terms of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| of being able to do something in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| and then later being able to give a bonus to the other employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| And I hope that all the other Knox County departments and office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| that possibly, that they may be able to do some kind of bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| before the end of the year also to their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| So, it's not taking sides with any Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| I mean, everybody's important and I respect and admire all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| but there is a huge difference right now with the men and women in blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| and what they're facing and what our country's facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| So, somehow, some way, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| I just feel like we need to sacrifice, we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| I mean, if I have to donate my paychecks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| for the next couple months to make it, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| I have to take it, but I'll write it back out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| if that's what I need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| because I feel that strongly that we're losing our men and women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| we're investing in the academy and we're losing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| And we talk about it and we talk about it like Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| I totally agree, I've said we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| And I hope that this talk from all this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| that it will lead to this next year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| that we've got a better pay scale for our officers and invest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| Like I say, it's an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| And everybody thinks everything's all important and it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| but what are our priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| One thing is to make sure our community is safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| and also our kids and our teachers when they're in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| And the people that do that are these men and women right back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| So, is there any number that we can lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| or somehow to make something work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| where we can let you all know that we do appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| and we know it's tough out there and it's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| COVID-19, let me tell you, COVID-19 is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| We have six hospitalizations right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| the most Knox County's ever had during the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| and the numbers keep rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| So, it's not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| But these men and women are going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| to be put at more risk over all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| So, somehow, we've got to pull together and make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| I mean, this isn't going away for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Mr. Jay, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| And by the way, Mr. Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| some of that may have, your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I wasn't sure if they were in the form of a question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I know that Sheriff Spangler had come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| I wasn't, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Is that number, can it be lower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I mean, everybody's been told to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| But did you have something more specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| If he thought there were any numbers that could be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Well, I just didn't know if he thought that number could be cut any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| I mean, he's cut, he's already cut several, as you all see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| But I just didn't know if he felt like it could be cut without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| I wish there were some more I could cut out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| And what I did do, and it pains me to stand up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| and tell you that I did not include administrative people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| I did not include secretaries that are in there in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| There are people in there that we did not include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| What I did include was those men and women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| as everybody has spoken up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| that are on the front lines, that are either working patrol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| working schools, which we doubled up on those school officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| whenever school was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| We put those back out on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| So we had double the manpower than we normally have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| during that three-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| With that being said, our corrections people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| But what you don't see, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| and these are some of the unsung heroes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| are those people who are working in our records division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| They couldn't take off as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| because they have to get that information out to the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| They have to be able to get the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| or our officers have to call in and get information on the radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Those people didn't get to take off either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| So there are people in there, our warrants people, who served warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| I went through that, I don't know how many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| two or three times with Allison to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| that I got everybody in there that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| like I said, it pains me to stand up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| and say that I couldn't give it to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| I want to, and there's not one of you up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| that don't want to do that, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| And trust me, I'm here for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| I'm not here for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| I'm just going to stand up here and fight for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| And what I get is what I get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| but I'm just not going to just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| hey, this is our number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| But it's a tough number to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Back to you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Sheriff Spangler, could you talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| about the savings that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| I mentioned in my opening comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| that there were $4 million in salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| and benefit savings this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| that you walked in on day one of this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| and said, I'd like to reuse that to support our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Can you talk about how you came up, how you did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| There are several ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| As I said, I wasn't going to replace chief positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| that we had there, that I would create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| more corrections and or patrol positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| which we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| I've not come to this commission like I did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| I didn't come to the commission asking for more positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| because I had created them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| with the money that was already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| I wanted to make sure that we saved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| The other money, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| is those officers that either left to go somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| those positions of 86 positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| accumulating over the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| We weren't able to fill all of our positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| But I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| that I don't have to come to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| every time asking for more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| whenever, if I can find that within my own budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| why wouldn't I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| That's a responsibility on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| and it's a responsibility that I owe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| each and every one of these people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| to make sure that they have the proper equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| and the proper personnel to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| And, most of all, this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| I have another question for one of your team members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Lieutenant Mellinax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| would you join us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| for a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| Lieutenant Mellinax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| I think you need to state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| I learned that from last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Gabe Mellinax, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| We served together on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Retirement Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| and have gotten to know each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| over the last, I don't know how long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| but it's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| And you came and spoke briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| to our Charter Review as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| But my question is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| what does it cost to train an officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| a patrol officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| or a corrections officer, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| I think what we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| in that meeting was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| that we had you coming in at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| $32,000 roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| for corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| And then we talked about the $14,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| But wouldn't you add an all-in cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| of training somebody to get under our force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Exactly. We were at about $124,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| or $125,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| and then they were just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| as the Sheriff said earlier and I said the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| they're going to Bean Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| which, just to be honest, is kind of a gut punch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Like I said, I love Bean Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| I ride my motorcycle through there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| It's $125,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| to train an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Director Caldwell said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| when the chips fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| after all of the equations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| he gave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| we're asking this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| to spend about $500,000 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| That's four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| Five officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| We lose them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| we're going to pay double, triple that amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| If you would just tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| you had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| poignant comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| to the Charter Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I don't want to get into all of the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| of what you might propose down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| because that's not this body's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| But you did have some comments about morale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| and about the workforce and I'd like for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| to just share those with us briefly, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| That was the most polite way anybody's told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| not to get long-winded like I normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| My guy's behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Just to sum it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| It's that gut punch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| You know, 23 years doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| or doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| And I can't stand up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| without getting emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| And I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I understand it's a crazy time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| And these gentlemen and ladies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| have a job to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| You know, I'm on the retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I had to get fiduciary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Just to be honest, I didn't even know what it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| until Mr. Caldwell explained it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| And I get the financial side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| But what you don't get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| you know, it was said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| I took a couple of notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| you know, when mortgages and loans fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| and those kind of things and financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| the impact, well, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| When those things fall, crime rates go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Where are we going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Bean Station, Oak Ridge, Pigeon Forge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Just to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Somebody said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| live within your means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| You know, I'd love to be able to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| have it that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| But I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| I'm a lieutenant at the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| and I worked 16 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| I didn't see my kids, didn't see my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| You know, because I've got to sleep somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| And I'm a lieutenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| And that's not just so I'm comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| That's to make it. That's to pay the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| I can't imagine somebody coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| with $36,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| one more thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| and I'll stop, I promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| because you told me to stay short-winded just then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| and it was very polite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| But, you know, I went to the National Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| in Quantico| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| and we're up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| and just like I told you the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| I had a couple of fears going up there as a good old country boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| But I would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| to this day put our training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| up against anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| And I'm doing all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| And the humiliation came in about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| week one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| And that was when we're sitting around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| the bonfire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| and we're having conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2223)|

| 0:37:07| And I said how much I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| And at the time it was $48,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| For the next nine weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| I was not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| to pay for one meal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Those guys refused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| to let me pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| I've had job opportunity after job opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| I don't care to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| that I had one last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| for $76,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Me, Gabe Mullinax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| The only reason I'm not doing it is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| I was born and raised here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| And just like I told you the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| they don't want to come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| They don't want to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| They're being forced to go places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| They can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| And I understand you have a job to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| financially, but I'm telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| it's going to continuously get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| And Commissioner Gill, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| very, very much for what you said earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| about focusing on what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| And it's a much bigger conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| I mean that from my heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| and I truly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Just as I said the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| I don't expect that man back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| to have the answers to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| And I agree, it's going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| And guess who's going? We're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| We've got a job to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| I took an oath. All of them took an oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| And we're not going to stop going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Okay? Until it truly...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| And it's getting there. We're there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| It's affecting the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| It's affecting what we can do with our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| The time we can spend with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| And we're going to go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| That's the cold, hard truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| It's happening every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| And where are we going to find those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| that are going to replace these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| that are coming up in the next two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Because, just like I said the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| that pool that we used to pull from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| it was as big as this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| People filled up wanting to be the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| It's about this big now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| And everybody's in competition with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| And right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I love this place, but they're not coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Nine. Nine of them. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Nine of them are coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| Okay. Thank you, Lieutenant Malmax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2359)|
| 0:39:31| Okay. I'll be going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| We've got Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| then Busler, then Gill, then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| I just want a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| I kept...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I heard that the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| and the Sheriff had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| I don't know if today or yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| And there was some type of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Sheriff, is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| I know the Mayor said there was an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| And I don't want to put words in the Mayor's mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| And if I'm wrong, Mayor, stand up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| shake me, body slam me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| There was a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| Proposal. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Commissioner Daley. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| What we're dealing with is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Now, there's only a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Everybody pays taxes in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| But anybody that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| for the government is working off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| of taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| And it's our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| it's spent properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| And I guess in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| this Commission body, not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| people here, did not do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| their job for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| and for the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| work in offices like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| the Sheriff's Department. Because if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| we had, we wouldn't be sitting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| this day. We would have had money for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| in the past. Now, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| can't make up for the failures of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| But we can start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| working for the betterment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| of the future. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| we're working off of a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Caldwell, we're working off of a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| We're not working off of real dollars, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| And there's a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| between working off of real dollars and a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| They were working off of cash flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| not a budget to keep them flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| And they had to raise the tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| 36 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| That's a heck of a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| of money just to keep them afloat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| And the state made them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| we're in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| even this minor amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| if we don't do a real good balanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| budget, then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| state will tell us what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| We don't want the state to come in here and tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| We want to be able to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| So, the only thing that I'm asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| you to please realize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| we want to help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| but we've got to have the money to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| and we really don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| we can't stand on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| what I call the real taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| that starts the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| ball of wax rolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| bear with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| If there's any money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| at all when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| starts coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| I'm going to be the first one to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| let's put whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| additional money we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| toward the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| Because I believe you all need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| and you deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| But, we've got to have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| We can't have a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| We've got to have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| We've got a budget, but there's not money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| really there to fund it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| We really don't know if we're funding it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| And there's a difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| You either have real money or you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| fake money. And a budget is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| fake money until you get the real money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| at the end. You've got to realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| what I'm asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| is if we can do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| $750,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| let's do the $750,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| but if the economy comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| let's put this on as our first priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| amongst us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| that's on this commission. Let's do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| the job we should have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| years past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| until they start rolling in right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| to where we're at now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| we're going to have to make a hard decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| It may not be what you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| but we're going to try to do the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| we can for you, and in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| maybe we'll take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| to heart and really listen to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| you all really need, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Commissioner Gill was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| so, we might not be able to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| the $1,500. We're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| try something, and then we're going to try to see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| we can get it down the road for you. And I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| I'm from the government, and I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| to help you. You've heard that a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| but I really truly believe that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| deserve it, and for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| I will work for that for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| but I can't promise it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| because I don't think our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| can stand it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| a question for Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2653)|
| 0:44:21| Could you just recap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| the number of officers that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| receive the bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| As far as the numbers or what they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Just the total number that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| actually get the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| It's on 820.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Okay. I just wanted to make sure that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| I wrote that down correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| you are a strong advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| for all of the officers standing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| and all of the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| For all of the officers standing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| and a fine representative for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| But you indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| under your last statement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| you would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| the mayor said, as a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| But I need to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| this question. How many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| officers are left out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| 820? How many total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| It's not going to be officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| It's going to be administrative people, secretaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| and you're looking at...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| We have around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| 1,050 employees right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Okay. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| would you be advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| for a lesser amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| to include all people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Well, that was one of the things that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| talked about. Like I said, when I stood up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| it pains me to say that I'm not asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| for everything or for everybody for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| Right. I would love to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| everybody have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| I'm willing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| whatever I have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| for the men and women of this agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Right. And we're willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| to make sure the financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| picture for Knox County is sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| So, there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| conversation to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| amount now and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| at the end of the year that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| benefit all employees of the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| No, ma'am. See, because then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| that makes me an advocate for all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| county employees. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| is that part of a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| that we can extend and have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| As far as later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| in the year, adding everybody else as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Or, under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| existing proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| the 750,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| is there a way to have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| about the 750 amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| now and an amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| later as the financial picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| is clearer for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| I think that's a doable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| thing. Okay. That is, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| it's set in concrete, that that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| what is going to happen if that money's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| I just don't want to say that's a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| and then later on we say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| we've got other things we need to do. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| not going to... I'm backing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| down, but I'm not. Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| Right. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| part of the conversation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| the 750 amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| which includes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| 820 personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| versus a smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| amount for all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| and then a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| amount later in the year. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| I would go with that 750 for all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| I just needed to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| we had some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| And then, again, later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Right. Because the holdup at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| this point is that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| So, we're speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| you agree with the mayor's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| at 750 and the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| not the amended resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| the existing resolution. I'm just wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| to make sure we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| clarification necessary for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| to understand that we value the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| that people do. And that really is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| word. We value the work of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| the employees, all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| in Knox County. Sure. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| And let me say, too, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| the proposal was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| I'm still going to stand up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| and fight for these men and women back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| So will we. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Thank you. We have had, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Commissioner Anders. That conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| confused me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| you know, we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| this is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| several years ago, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| 2012, when somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| we would go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| a month of discussions and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| drop something on the day of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| the budget vote that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| after opportunity after opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| to have the conversation, I thought we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| the conversation last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| two weeks ago. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| and then the conversation I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| between meetings between the Sheriff and the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| you know, the Sheriff is going to advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| for $1,500 as anybody would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| But if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| at the numbers that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| sure of, that we feel comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| everybody gets $750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| and re-evaluated the December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| for another bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| And that was discussion county-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I mean, we had this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| two weeks ago when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| boldly asked the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| and to ask him to respond at the first part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| of any overage in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| go toward the county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| And he said that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| And this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| advocated, and we didn't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| a vote on it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| so if we do the $1,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| and revenues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| not there, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| we just laid people off this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| summer, and you may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| have to lay people off in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| if we shut back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| I'm reading the tea leaves around the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| a little bit, and I don't know that there's support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| the $1,500, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| I sure like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| proposal of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| adding the extra million onto the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| and then I think more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| people are comfortable with that. And then revisiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| it, I mean, the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| has always backed the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Office, and last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| year gave them a 6% pay raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| more than anybody in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| county got 3 or 4, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| they got 6. The year before that, they got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| do we need a tax increase to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| teachers, roads, and Sheriff's deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| salaries? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| But seven people or eight people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| are not going to propose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| I'd take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| I guess we can take the vote on the $1,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| but I think the sure thing is the $750 and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| re-evaluation in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| I'm reading the tea leaves around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| But I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| you know, if you don't have the revenue in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| you're laying people off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| like we did in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| I mean, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| nobody been more important through this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| law enforcement, health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| fire, and EMS. I mean, there's nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| been more important than that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| The conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| has been $750 until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| I mean, if we could give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| $5,000 a piece, I'd do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| But I mean, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| no, it's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| it amazes me how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| we have a conversation and we feel like we're at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| comfortable spot, then boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| the conversation that we just had, I mean, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| she talked about $750 and the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| said $750 and then spread it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| around and then it was $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| I got a little confused there, so I really want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| some clarification that, is that what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| was said? I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| I support the $750,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| but what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| discussed $750 for 820| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| employees. So, the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| was in the amount of $750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| because you have a total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| 1,100 employees. Some people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| willing to get anything. That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| saying that there should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| flexibility up to the $750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| if we wanted to include all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| employees. Okay, that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Commissioner Carringer, then Schoonmaker, I'm not sure which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| of your other slides came up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| I just wanted to clarify for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| anybody in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| or watching TV and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| We are definitely going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| to do the $750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| for 820| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| for the sheriff's office, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| We haven't decided anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| That's the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| That's what we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Yes, and then we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| saying maybe toward the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| like what I was saying too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| if we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| give more and also to all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| that see fit. But that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| would be later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| But for right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| the proposal is to do the $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| No, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| The proposal is for $1,500 using an extra fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Right, but we said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| we will at least do half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| Or we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Commissioner Carringer, what's on the floor is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| we have the original budget proposed. We had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| a substitute amendment which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| for the $1,500. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| really the $750 while amply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| discussed is not something that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| actively on the floor for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| Just to kind of confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| I've been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Knox County citizen of the 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| District for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Didn't, you know, always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| appreciated the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| You know, just they were there and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| But 15 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| as a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Tom Spangler and the Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| at the time allowed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| the opportunity to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| in the Citizen's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Sheriff's Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| And that really opened my eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| as far as what the men and women of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Sheriff's Department do. And I've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| had a sincere appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| But as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| County Commissioner, I do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| fiduciary responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| to look out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| for the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| comfortable if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| the Mayor of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| is saying that he will give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| the 820 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| of the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| a $750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| bonus on or about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Thanksgiving, and at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| same time look to see if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| additional revenue that's been received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| that we could increase that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| bonus at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| And I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| I rely a lot on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| our Knox County Finance Team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| to push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| us in the right direction to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| hey, this is what's hopefully going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| But we're proposing an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| $850 million budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| and we are not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Chris will tell you, we are not guaranteed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| that we're going to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| $850 million this next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| year. If we only receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| $835 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| be in deep weeds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| But I rely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| on the Finance Team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| to give me the straight scoop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| and if this is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| they've negotiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| I'm willing to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| $750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| with the option of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| if we have additional revenue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| increase that bonus at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| All right. Back to you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Mr. Chairman. Following up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| the comments presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| this is just a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| This is a difference in opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| The Mayor can propose anything he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| This Commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3345)|

| 0:55:49| determining what we want our priorities in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| county to be. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| there may have been a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| but the original proposal came from our Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| where he walked down in front of us weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| and said, I've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| hard to save money in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| I've worked hard to cut back on our personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| And I want to give our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| frontline officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| a $1,500 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| That's what he came to us with, originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| He said he's been a good steward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| of the money and he's been a good steward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Time to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| in those frontline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| officers. So this is just a difference in opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| I think more is needed now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| to take care of the officers who have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| through the trenches in a way that we won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| ever, ever experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| Ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| And if there's more later, then we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| double down and we also ought to help the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| 200 employees in the Sheriff's office in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| But this is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| a difference in opinion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| what can we afford and what do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| show our value to our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| And we're talking about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| $500,000 difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| That's four officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| to be retrained if we lose four more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| officers. I think that's worth the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| investment. I think spending more now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| tells everyone in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| don't leave and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| be part of our team. And then if we have more later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| let's do it again. And let's do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| it again until we get to a point where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| say, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| You don't have to work a side job. You don't have to miss seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| your kids. And let's do it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| until a point where they say, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3439)|

| 0:57:25| It's just a difference of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Sheriff Spangler, can I please ask you a question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| I want to clear up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| this savings expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| If revenues come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| fully, like was budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| the savings we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| was because positions were not filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| correct? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Which would you rather be able to do, fill those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| positions or give out a bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3483)|
| 0:58:11| Commissioner, by no means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| the main positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| that we didn't fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| was because I didn't want to fill them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| with those positions as chiefs and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| I wanted to create more positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| I thought you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Not being able to fill the positions is not because I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| want to fill them. It's because we don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| quality or the people who want to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| to this profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| So they're either leaving and I have to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| to replace. The other thing to take in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| is, as it was mentioned with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| if we have the influx| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| or the outflux of people that go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| and retire that are eligible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| if we're going to have such a young agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| it's unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| And that experience going out the door is non...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| You can't replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| And I love the people, these young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| that are coming within this agency because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| by gosh, we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| And I hope they get that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| But it'll be tough for two or three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| You know, I saw ads for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Pigeon Forge and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3551)|

| 0:59:15| They're running ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| They're running ads for homes with employment, too, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| They are, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Sheriff, you know, I've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| supported you, I've supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| the deputies with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3565)|

| 0:59:29| And I intend to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| I just, I'm a bit weary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| of putting a number out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| because we have a responsibility to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| taxpayer. We also have a responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| to the other employees in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| who, from teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| all the way down to solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| they're getting nothing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| personally would rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| stick with a 750 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| see where we're at and then try to do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| do a comprehensive study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| I, you know, we keep talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| about salaries and nobody's ever provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3603)|

| 1:00:15| We had one done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| back in the early 90s, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3617)|

| 1:05:55| And the reason being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| is because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| everybody's heart's in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3959)|

| 1:06:05| The difference is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| is if you really look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| we're going to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3969)|

| 1:06:23| because we call each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| by our first names, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| yeah, Tommy, he said, you know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=3987)|

| 1:06:49| if he said that. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4009)|

| 1:21:12| All right, so we have a motion to withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| with a second from Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| That actually came from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Chris, if that's what we don't even need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| to act on, if he formally withdrawn it, then I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| crossing it off. Okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| the next item is item number seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| which is R-20-6-106-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| would you read that into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| It's a resolution approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| a financial crisis contingency plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| and checklist. Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| I have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| for approval from Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| and I believe that was Mr. Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Was that Commissioner Buehler with the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Chris, this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| that is different than what we normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| have at this budget meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| It also reminds me of, I think, the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| and procedures that we passed two months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| I believe, at County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| So could you kind of clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| before this vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| I know we did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| procedural plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| and I believe it was either last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| or the month before. You know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| It was probably May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| I think it was during one of our Zoom meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Just clarify a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| about what's the difference between that update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| the policies and procedures, and this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| They both sound complementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Yeah, what you all approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| back in May was an internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| service fund balance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| What you have before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| is a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| crisis contingency plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| This is something that we got from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| GFOA and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| Perry and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| worked through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| to finally put into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| writing a policy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| we already had in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| that we do when any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| type of crisis happens. And of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| this reminded us because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| So we put together a checklist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| which we did and still are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| doing through the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| situation. But it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| formalizes it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| it helps us when we go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Moody's and S&P to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| we've got strong management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| over topics like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| and they like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| Very good. All right, there's a question from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| Point of privilege, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| I recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5006)|

| 1:23:30| from the Seymour-Volmavier Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| before we all run off and be adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| So thank you, Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| for coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5016)|

| 1:23:40| about this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Okay, that item is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5022)|

| 1:23:46| vote? And we talked a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| but I believe the second was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| from Commissioner Beeler, the first was from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Is that right? Or who on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Was that Commissioner Schoonmaker? Then Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-special-session?start=5034)|
