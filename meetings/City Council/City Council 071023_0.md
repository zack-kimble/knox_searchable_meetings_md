| 0:00:17| If you'll bow your heads, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=17)|
| 0:00:22| Our Heavenly Father, we come before you so grateful for all the many blessings you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=22)|
| 0:00:28| bestowed upon us and upon the City of Knoxville, and tonight we just must say we are so grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=28)|
| 0:00:34| for this wonderful rain, which was so desperately needed, and so many people have suffered terrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=34)|
| 0:00:40| consequences and concerns for the future of their farms and of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=40)|
| 0:00:48| We pray, we are grateful that you heard our prayers last time for the rain, and we bless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| you for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| We pray that you will be with those tonight who have heavy hearts for the many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| that they are struggling with, the many challenges, but we thank you for the challenges that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| into our lives and for the opportunities to serve you in so many ways that you have put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| We are so grateful for those many who serve so many in our community, and we praise you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=73)|
| 0:01:21| for calling for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| We pray that you'll be with us as we meet this evening, and that we may have open minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=84)|
| 0:01:31| and be clear about the issues that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=94)|

| 0:02:51| I'd like to postpone 11B for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=171)|

| 0:03:27| All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=207)|

| 0:03:31| Have likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Next, this is the junction where we have the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| I'm sure our mayor would want me to convey to you his apologies for not being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| He is not here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| He's out with family matters and nothing of a good nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| We're here today to carry forward, and he sends us his best, and he will be back with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| us very, very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| We wish him and his family fun and happiness where they are at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| A few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| First, early voting for the city elections are going on right now, and they'll still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| be going on, even if you're watching this on replay next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| I'd like to encourage people to get out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| Also, I would like to note that all members of council are present, even those who participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| in the Cross Knox relay run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| It was a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| It got up real early in the morning, and we all had a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| The next thing that we're going to do is train for the marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Councilman Brown will not have the surgery excuse anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| Secondly, on another matter, last week, MPC had a meeting on the visitability issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=275)|
| 0:04:44| This council, late last year, unanimously passed a resolution asking MPC to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| looking into that issue for future new developments, residential developments in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| It was a pretty heated meeting, to be blunt about it, but the process hasn't run its course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| yet, and it will eventually work its way to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| One thing that I did learn was that, and this is very unfortunate, that there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| kind-hearted folks out there that are willing to put in handicap ramps for those folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=314)|
| 0:05:22| aren't as able to move around anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| These good Samaritans, for lack of a better term, do this on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| They pay for it themselves, but there's one individual who has been turning these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| in for not having building permits for doing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| That hurts many people in many ways, and it's very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| I think in the very near future, we'll need to look into the possibility of waiving permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| fees on something like that, because I can't think of any legitimate reason for making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| it more difficult for people to get in and out of their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| That's actually an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| It's not my idea originally, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Well then, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| It's still a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| It's still a good idea, yeah, and we'll go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| I wanted to update council on the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| As you all know, the city has hired a consultant to do a little more extensive salary survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| this year on pay for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| I'm going to be looking at benefits as well as pay and trying to factor that all in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| The survey is going out right now, asking cities about their pay and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| We've changed some of the cities that we normally send a survey to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| We're keeping about the same number of surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| We've eliminated some of the ... We've changed it so we're moving more in a radius from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=410)|
| 0:06:58| trying to get cities north, south, east, and west of us and focusing a lot on cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| of a very similar size to what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| We've also eliminated the private businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| I think almost exclusively this time, we're going to be looking at other government agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| for pay data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| I think the timing on this is still we're looking at having something finalized around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| February, but the process is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Ms. O'Connell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| I want to make a couple of comments tonight about something that has come to my attention today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| In fact, it's been brought to my attention today by a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| And it's a big concern because it came to my attention today that on Thursday, the 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| there is scheduled, I believe, by MPC, I guess I would call it a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| Would that be correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| Which is to involve some discussion about billboards and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| Well, needless to say, it has drawn some folks have somehow become aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=477)|
| 0:08:06| The contacts to me were very critical because the assumption was that council was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| with that and was aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| I was not aware of such a meeting having been advertised or even planned until I had several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| contacts today, some by e-mail, some by phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| So and in talking with a number of people in the city and people who were on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| they were not aware of the meeting either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| So this is not to be critical, but I think I just have to clarify that no council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=512)|
| 0:08:40| I don't believe, were aware of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| I understand a number of the people who are on the advisory committee looking at considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| some legislation or some change in the codes were not aware of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| And I've just happened to be the lucky one to get all those calls today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| And I just want to state that the biggest criticism and the thing that concerns me most is that I was told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=538)|
| 0:09:09| that there was not proper public notice and that this was learned about in quite a roundabout way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| So I believe I am told that there was a press release, but it was not listed in public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| and that's where people generally look for that kind of information and to know if they want to be a participant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=564)|
| 0:09:33| So I was alarmed because this is kind of a hot issue, has been for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| and will probably generate a lot of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| I personally have a conflict in not having known anything about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| can do nothing about trying to participate in such a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| and hearing the comments that I would personally like to have been aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| and would not have made the commitment that I made had I known that that meeting was going to be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| And, you know, I just think we need to clear this up because if it wasn't in public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| I wonder if that public meeting is actually being handled in the manner in which we handle public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| And I'm sure Mr. Donaldson would like to just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| There are three events that will be coming up over the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| We do have a council workshop, and I am aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| Last, in August, we received a summary report and recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| from Mayor Haslam's study committee on digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| with the request that we further review and take action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| And we started that process by having this public meeting that will come up on Thursday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| We issued a press release last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| And I e-mailed those people that I was aware of that, you know, had e-mailed me about digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| I e-mailed a couple of members of the staff to review the language in the press release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=667)|
| 0:11:16| to make sure it was accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Concurrently, we've scheduled a workshop with city council for November 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| And any official notice will be tied to the November 8th MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| where that item might be part of the public agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| And that notice hasn't been published yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Well, I was aware, of course, of the council workshop because I think we canvassed council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| to see what might be an evening that most members of council would be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| But I think the alarming thing was that some of the members who were on the advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| were kind of being attacked because they had recommended something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| And I think they felt that it wasn't necessarily a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| It was just an overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Anyway, enough said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| But my concern is that there is a meeting day after tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| of which most people and maybe some people on this council were not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| And I think that is a very regrettable situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| I think that, you know, we're going to get the calls and the e-mails and the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| And for us not to be in a position to respond is, I find it very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| And so I just felt I needed to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| It's actually related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| As somebody who doesn't know about this, could somebody say when and where this workshop is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| Well, you know, I have tried to find out today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| and no one knew because they didn't know that there was one except the rumor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| So if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Yes, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Thursday evening, 6.30 in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| You're kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Well, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Mr. Hill is not here tonight, but I'd like to just kind of update folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| the council and those in the audience and those watching on television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| the status of the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| I keep hearing from people, especially in South Knoxville, saying, well, what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| We haven't heard anything in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| It's like the initial process was great, and then everything is just silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| And, of course, there are lots of things happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| but there hasn't been much public process lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| And hopefully that's going to shift back into more of a public mode in terms of vetting the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Hargraves & Associates has now assembled their consulting team of engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| and landscape architects and other professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| and they're working on schematic design for public improvements in the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| the priority improvements especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| Today and tomorrow, there are a series of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Hargraves and some of their folks are in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Tomorrow at 1.30, the technical committee meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| But the big thing that's happening publicly, and this council will meet again in the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| but I just want to make sure that we start getting it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| is on November 13th at 6 o'clock, there will be a meeting at the Corbella Temple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| a public meeting to present the draft schematic design concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| that have been produced by Hargraves and their team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| And hopefully people will feel included and their feedback will be heard and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| But I just wanted to go ahead and sort of put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Also, Mr. Hill has now hired an assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Some of you may have met him on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Her name is Susanna Bass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| So he's not a one-man show anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| He's now a one-man with a helper and a two-person show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| And so I think we're right on par with some other cities like Portland, Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| They have two people that sort of coordinate all their waterfront development programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| So I think we're doing well there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| But I just want to thank council for your continued support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| and encourage people to pay attention and get involved and to show up, especially on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| I accidentally overlooked something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Just a reminder from last meeting on Monday, October 29th at 7.30 in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| the public auditorium's ballroom is going to be the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| It's going to be an organizational meeting for the Tazewell Pike Beverly Road Task Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| to look at possible solutions to the traffic concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| particularly at Tazewell Pike and Beverly Road out in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| but also all along Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| At least one member of county commission is going to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| City engineering is assisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| TDOT is involved, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| And county engineering, the road folks have been invited as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| I'd like to invite anyone to come who would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| Say when and where again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Civic auditorium ballroom, Monday, October 29th at 7.30 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| Trying to have it early in the day to try to respect people's work schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| versus scheduling something at 1, 2, or 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Try to limit the meeting to an hour to an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Vice Mayor, just wanted to remind everyone we're going to have a public property naming committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| this coming Thursday, November 1st at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| There's going to be three items, I think three on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| One will be the Regas Square situation, which we're all familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| Also, I'm not sure of the name of the street directly in front of Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| but there's a request and application in to change that to Bobcat Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| There's one resident on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| That's the person that's interested in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| And then potentially Mimosa Drive over in South Knoxville in front of the Corbella Temple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| possibly half of that street, and find the appropriate way to honor what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1039)|

| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1461)|

| 0:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| My question is, and the last time we looked at this, I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| asked Mr. Wetzel when our recycling centers would begin to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| accept plastics 3 through 6, and this contract still indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| 1 and 2, and this is not affecting my approval of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| ordinance, but I sure would like to see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| I understand the county can accept plastics of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| numbers and would love to see us be able to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| We're close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| I talked with John Homan today, our waste reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| I think we're a few weeks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Hopefully, by the end of the year, we'll do 1 through 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| And will there be some kind of publicity to residents that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| can bring those to our super centers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Horrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Will they need to be segregated into a different bin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| The bins have segregation sections, and then if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| I was thinking of the 1 and 2s, and then 3 through 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| Can they all be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| I think the bins will be set up appropriately, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| communicate how those need to be separated if they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| Obviously, if you have a contract like I do with Waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Connections, our local vendor for recycles, you'll just throw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| it in the bin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| But, yeah, that's good news except all 1 through 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| That's real good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| And the recycle market's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| We're going to generate good revenue here in the next five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| years on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| David, will that require an amendment to this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=1724)|

| 0:33:24| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Well, I was just going to explain what's happened on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| real briefly for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| We talked about this a long time at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| What we were doing with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Our preference was to do it in C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| And there were some unanswered questions about fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Talked extensively to our building codes department that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| enforces that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| And their interpretation is that C6 requires an opaque fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| And Mr. Newbert is real concerned about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| Wants a fence that the police department can see through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Every side of this property, I believe, is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| So, we're not impacting neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| So, I'd like to move this back to a C4 as was passed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| Second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| I'm not sure that was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| I thought you said I'd like to move that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Well, I think I was talking in yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| But I think we need a motion to adopt and then a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| And a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2058)|

| 0:34:23| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| And a motion to adopt the ordinance that's printed in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| I think, I believe we need to amend it to C4 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Because it was passed at C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| So, I'd like to move to amend it to C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2076)|

| 0:34:39| All those in favor of the amended motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Oh, Councilman Frost, you have a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| If you call it last minute, I'm trying to come up with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| solution that worked out with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Discussed the possibility of having a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| So, I'm trying to come up with a solution that worked out with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Discussed the possibility of if we had to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| that Mr. Newbert was going to come back and ask for C6 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| would then grandfather in his C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| So, if and when that property is ever used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| or transferred, if it's transferred to someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| that C4 zoning would not go with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| and it would lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Any further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| Seeing no further likes, the motion we have on the table is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| to amend and to approve this at C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| Amend it to C-4, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2141)|
| 0:35:41| As we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| All those in favor of the motion, please signify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Hold on, we have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I think Mr. Newbert, just going to follow up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| excuse me, what Mr. Frost said, Mr. Newbert indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| at the last meeting that he was willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| So just for, you know, for those people who might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| watching out there that didn't see the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| They're lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Are we thoroughly confused now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2161)|
| 0:36:11| Are we ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| I'm going to confuse you a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Oh, help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2174)|
| 0:36:14| The ordinance says C-4 and it'll be first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| It was originally presented as C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| It was amended at the last meeting to C-6 and that's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| the revised ordinance is actually printed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| But this is the way it was originally presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| So if we reconsidered, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Yeah, but as awkward as it is, we're reconsidering an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| ordinance that was passed that recites it's passed to C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| So it is an awkward procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| But this is the way we have to wade through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2209)|

| 0:36:53| So we're now on the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Everybody's clear on what we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| All those in favor of the motion to amend, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2218)|

| 0:37:15| And I say for those for those who missed the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| meeting, I said I would do that if this if I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| pointing that out to point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Is this a first of your word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| I believe this is the first, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| You are a man of your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| And maybe not the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| So now we're on the motion to pass as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2252)|

| 0:37:39| Councilman Becker, you have anything to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Now we're now we need a motion to adopt, which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2261)|

| 0:38:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| All of that passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Anybody who's confused, please see the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| record in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| I think that will be very clear in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Madam Recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2292)|

| 0:38:27| We would improperly second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| There was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| It does need to go to the property naming committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Well, I don't think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| You know, one of the things that we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| prevent is people having to change their addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| and no one uses the current name Distribution Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| so it wouldn't displace anybody or cause them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| any change of address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| And it's private property, so I think this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2339)|

| 0:39:23| who has signed up to be heard, and typically we let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2363)|

| 0:41:59| East Tennessee area this past year, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| We transport these children up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Their parents are never billed for the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| The children are never billed for the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| I'll be preparing packets of information for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| of you with regards to our actual budgetary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| requirements and where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| And while by no means will the men of Corbella and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| the folks that support them allow this to affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| these children's care and services, I will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| quite frankly that this is going to cause a severe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| impediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Just some rough figures that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| There's over 6,000 Shriners here within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| bounds of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| And in order to be a Shriner, you have to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| member of the appendant body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| And there are some 27,000 of us that participate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| Masonic activities in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| So it's something that causes us grave concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| We will let you be aware that it is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| impede our activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| And we feel that we can act in conformity with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| ordinance as it currently is, pre-amendment, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| that if there is some sort of a licensure or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| sort of other procedure to make sure that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| have organizations that are not participating in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| conformity with the ordinance to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| eliminated from that, then we would certainly agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| and acquiesce to anything along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| We are a 501c3 charitable organization, which means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| that those donations are tax deductible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| So we wanted to make it plain that we're vehement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| in our opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| We're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| And we want everyone to know the services that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| provide and what it's going to do to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Any questions for Mr. Jones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| Thank you, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Now for council discussion and or motion as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| relates to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| I move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Seeing no lights, all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Sorry, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| As maker of the motion, I guess I should say for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| all present that council did issue a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| that council did engage in a workshop on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| And it was my understanding from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| comments that night that the support of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| ordinance was unanimous at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Certainly folks, well, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| But at any rate, we did engage in a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| about this at a publicly notified workshop and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| discussed the ramifications that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| be present going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2682)|
| 0:44:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| pretty lengthy workshop on it and we heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| the police department and in terms of some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| safety issues with people in the streets and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| guess the fire department, you know, they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| training in safety and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| And this is important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| And I know the Shriners are a group of good people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| who know how to conduct themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| But I think overall it's, you know, the consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| was this is just not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Yeah, I guess what was a consensus, it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2722)|
| 0:45:22| I actually do think that there are situations like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| this where it makes sense and it's a benefit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2729)|
| 0:45:29| So I'll actually be opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| But it was a good discussion and there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| solid consensus around this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Well, unfortunately, I couldn't attend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| workshop because I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| But had I been there, I would have voted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| support it because the concerns that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| expressed to me involve the intersection, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| very busy, very dangerous intersections at best in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| the district I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| And I simply could not support continuing to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| those situations there where I've had many, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| contacts over the last, well, six years where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| people have just expressed their concern that given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| enough time and enough situations that someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| was going to get hurt and that it did create some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| issues where some folks were not as patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| So unfortunately, knowing that this is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| a hardship on some of the charities that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| relied on this, it's very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| But just given what I believe to be our mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| as councilmen, if we look at the charter, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| responsible for the health and the welfare of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| And in taking that seriously, I feel I can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| nothing but support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Because at this time, there is just nothing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| secure the health and welfare and safety of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| citizens other than to support this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Yeah, and I concur with those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Councilman Pelow, I think one of the things we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| talked about at the workshop was that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| intersections that would be most productive for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| these kinds of solicitations are also the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| most congested, busiest intersections, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| becoming more and more of an issue as our streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| and highways become more congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| And we just, I think there's a general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| consensus, not unanimous necessarily, that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| was, that that's going to grow in terms of its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| importance, the safety in those overly congested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| intersections and major arterial streets, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| Let me also say that, so that it's very clear, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| I hesitate because I don't wish to say I speak for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| council, but I think it's important since I chaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| that workshop that those individuals who are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| today, those individuals who didn't have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| opportunity to see the workshop and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| discussion, that they understand that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| council struggled very mightily with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| this particular issue and that it is not turning or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| did not turn a deaf ear to the concerns and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| eloquent speech by Attorney Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| It was very valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| And we know there are a lot of good organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| out there that do a lot of good things with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| money they raise under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| However, it kind of became a, at least the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| discussion centered around a cost-benefit type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| analysis and our concern for the safety of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| I want to make it very clear before someone goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| forth and tries to say that this council turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| its back on organizations, great organizations such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| as the Shriners, that's not what this council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| We're just trying to look at this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| And in the workshop, the discussion and the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| was about the safety of people and the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| problem that could happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| We don't wish that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| We don't want it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| But the risk there was one that at least it seemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| there was consensus, there was a big concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| So I wanted to make sure that it was very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| that there was a lot of debate about it, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| concern, and it really became an issue of safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071023?start=2941)|
