| 0:05:23| Anything else to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=323)|

| 0:05:36| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Before I get into the mayor's report, I do want to mention, we have five people who have signed up, or four people who have signed up to speak against 11S, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=338)|
| 0:05:49| That's the bus contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| So I'd ask the four of you to get together, and one person drop off, because our typical standard is three people per item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| So that's Noah Nordstrom, Constance Overy, Charles Crooms, and Virginia Crooms, if you wouldn't mind getting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=359)|
| 0:06:07| And then, when it's time, just let me know which of the three speakers will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| You can see some advance notice on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=376)|

| 0:06:24| and we will have a meeting with the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=384)|

| 0:06:33| we will join with Volunteer Ministry Center and the Salvation Army to cut the ribbon on the foyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| which is a low-barrier, housing-focused overnight emergency shelter for individuals experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=399)|

| 0:06:50| The foyer is located at 409 North Broadway in the former thrift store of the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| It's a great partnership between VMC and the Salvation Army with the goal to serve 40 or more individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=417)|

| 0:08:51| That's at 10 a.m. on Thursday, December 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| We've landscaped center medians and left-turn lanes, added street trees, wider sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| bike lanes, safer and more aesthetic crosswalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| and enhanced transit connections on Magnolia between Jessamine and North Bertrand Streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| The first phase of the project is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=550)|

| 0:09:31| Next on that day, we have several things happening that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=571)|

| 0:09:48| Representatives of the new owners of the property, which is WRS, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| they will join the city in briefing residents on plans for converting the long, vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| and blighted property into a mixed-use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| something I know the neighborhood and folks have been waiting on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| The redevelopment team intends to make a multimillion-dollar reinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| to breathe new life into that building, which, by the way, is over 435,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=609)|
| 0:10:17| So not an easy task to redevelop something that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| So again, the briefing will take place at 2.30 on Thursday, December 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| at the Pellissippi State Community College campus on Magnolia Avenue, 1610 East Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=625)|

| 0:10:58| It starts at 4 and goes on until 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| It is located next to the Sam E. Hills School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| and the complex includes two multipurpose synthetic turf fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=664)|

| 0:11:16| two full-size gymnasiums with basketball courts, a fitness area, and a performing arts area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| There's also a really unique partnership there with Cherokee Health Systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| and UT Medical Center to provide access to preventative care and wellness programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| as well as treatment for acute and chronic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| So it's a really super addition to that complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=701)|

| 0:11:48| As you all know, the Knoxville branch in AACP last month celebrated a pretty major milestone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| the 100th anniversary of its founding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=715)|

| 0:12:04| and that was a really nice event, the wonderful and fitting tribute to a century of fighting for justice and equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| Councils also approved a congratulatory resolution acknowledging the centennial of the local NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=732)|

| 0:13:04| We definitely are honored and even humbled to celebrate 100 years of fighting for justice in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=784)|
| 0:13:13| and understanding that the NAACP branch has never been doing it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| We had people in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| We had people with other community organizations that have worked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| And so we want to say thank you to the community as well for their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| And just to say we will continue to be committed to working with the mayor-elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=809)|
| 0:13:37| and all the councilpersons that will be here in 2020 and beyond to ensure that we continue to work for equity in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=817)|

| 0:13:49| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Okay, that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Any councilmembers have reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Well, I just want to acknowledge two events that are coming up in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=838)|

| 0:14:18| And then also this coming weekend, Old North Knoxville neighborhood is having a holiday home tour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| which is a fundraiser for the community where we fund charities around and school donations that we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| as well as projects around the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=872)|

| 0:22:55| This application was presented as suffrage way, and at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| we were informed by MPC staff there that we could not use way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| because it's used for private roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| So there's been basically we were trying to come up with a name on the fly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| or a replacement at Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| So moving forward, we will have a list of names that can't be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| like way, street, road, et cetera, for honorary street namings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| So the gist of this request is to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| and honor the centennial of woman suffrage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| and so the amended motion would be to, instead of go with Suffrage Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| would be to go with Woman Suffrage Centennial Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| Square was kind of the only option that came up at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| and in further conversation, it's been realized that that's kind of confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| to have something square on a sign right next to Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| And so we just weren't very good and creative on the fly at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| and so we have worked with the Women's Suffrage Centennial Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| and come up with an alternative that we were not able to on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| And so my amended motion is for Woman Suffrage Centennial Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| So this is the, we're voting on the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| and then we'll go back to the original as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| The amendment passes, so now we go to original as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1479)|

| 0:25:22| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| We have three people sign up, so we'll go ahead and have them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Three people have signed up to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| First is Noah Nordstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Mr. Nordstrom, please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| As you know, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| and if you keep an eye on the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Noah Nordstrom, 1602 Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Nordstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I'm here today because I'm requesting that you postpone the sale of the police headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| to the Clayton Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| I'm excited about the prospect of a science museum in place of the police headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| but some details within the agreement concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| If the land is sold tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| East Knoxville no longer has any power to ensure that the Clayton Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| will utilize this land to benefit the existing community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| This community deserves to decide the fate of this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| After all, it is stolen land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Not only do I mean stolen in terms of Cherokee removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| but as a reference to the predominantly black neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| which was taken and destroyed to build the police headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| the Coliseum, and James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| As I knocked doors this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| several elders in the East Knoxville community fondly told me about the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| that once existed on this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| I urge this body not to give this land away for a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| to one of Knoxville's richest white multimillionaires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| without firm commitments to the community about how they will benefit from the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Next is Constance Severy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| Ms. Severy, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Keep an eye on the timer and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| My name is Constance Severy, 301 North Charlie Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| Noah said it perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| That is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| You're selling this property for $1 to a multimillionaire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| and it's unclear about some of the closing factors of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| particularly how we are not going to have any real say-so once this deal is confirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| I agree also with what Noah said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| You have not spoken with the community about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| You've already destroyed it with the Coliseum move the first time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| The reality is that, as always, are you all listening to your public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| It's the same question we keep asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| And the reality is that the answer is obviously a no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| because this deal is ready to pretty much go other than this vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| and either you don't or you postpone it, or you do and it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| I mean, I just feel like, as we've already discussed, the police thing altogether is disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| We have a $37 million project we're going to fund for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| This continues to be a cycle of what I keep saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| Are you all listening to your public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Because today your people are telling you, we don't want this to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| So the question is, did you hear us or did you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Next is Mr. David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1691)|
| 0:28:20| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| My name is David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| I live at 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| I'm here as well in solidarity to folks who spoke before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| that you all postpone this vote until January, until the new council can come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| and ask you all to postpone this vote on selling this land that occupies and surrounds the police headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| and selling the land for $1 million to the millionaire Jim Clayton, as Noah said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| The piece of land that has been stolen, as Noah said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| especially when we look at urban renewal and we look at the legacy of urban renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| and the context of gentrification that is currently going on in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| we ask that you prevent and postpone action of further development in this area without the community engagement that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1748)|
| 0:29:17| After the last community engagement meeting about this issue, folks thought there was going to be more, but there wasn't none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| So we need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| We need more community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Also, we need to make sure that whenever this agreement passes through, that the community is benefiting from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| both economically and otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| So we don't want to see more and more development happening where people are getting pushed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| where affordable housing gets diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Right next door to this area is affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| It's Town View, Vista, The Bricks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Those are real working class communities that live right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| We fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| We fear for their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| And we don't see this as having any other impact other than pushing them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Because of you all, the city of Knoxville has not put in the due diligence, has not put in the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| has not created an agreement, a strong agreement, to ensure that the communities are benefiting from this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| So we need to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| And furthermore, we need a Knoxville for all, not a Knoxville that works for millionaires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| And if Jim Clayton really had a care for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| one thing he would advocate for would be higher taxes for himself and other millionaires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| so I could go to public schools and pay for social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| One thing he would advocate in this thing is making sure that his hard-earned money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| I would ask you to stick to the topic and not to the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| So Jim Clayton is the person who is primarily behind this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| So to not bring him up would be not appropriate in my instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| I believe in being transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| And when we make deals with people, we need to understand who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| And we also need to encourage them to actually make agreements with our city that actually benefits the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| So Nashville, a group called Stand Up Nashville recently worked with the city of Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| and the National Soccer Holdings, which is opening up a new soccer team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| As many folks know, there's a new major league soccer team happening in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| So they got a community benefits agreement with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| So what was involved in this community benefits agreement to ensure that that big development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| similar to this development and similar to the baseball development that a lot of people talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| what did Nashville do to ensure that agreement benefits the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| They prioritized affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Making sure that 20% of the housing units being built in that specific development were affordable and workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| They had a wage floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Making sure that the company agreed to directly hire stadium workers, such as ushers, ticket takers, box office, janitorial, custodial staff, whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| Paying all those folks at least $15.50 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| They prioritized community services and amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| Putting a 4,000 square foot facility for child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| They prioritized jobs and workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| Making mandatory safety training for all construction workers and supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Leveling the playing field for responsible contractors that provide safe, thriving careers for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| And they had a community advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| So I believe if Jim Clayton wants, if he wants this to benefit the community, if you all want this to benefit the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| we need to have agreements like that set in stone before we make any decisions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| So again, advocate for you all to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Wait for the new city council to get in to make a decision and do some research as far as what the community needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| have more community meetings, and make sure that we have robust benefits agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| and improvement agreements in this contract, in this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| At the end of the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| I'd like to ask our COO, David Brace, to talk a little bit about the agreement and what still will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1974)|
| 0:33:03| Yeah, thank you very much, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| How the next step is, what the next step is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| City Council, and I think all of you received the information that Council Member Ms. Parker had brought up this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| which was very helpful to clarify some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| I do want to just recognize that Mr. Clayton is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| If you'll just raise your hand, Mr. Clayton, and Michelle Clayton, Keith Green, Susan Brown, and Kelly Hedden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| Kelly is with Barbara McMurray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| The others are with the Clayton team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| They are here tonight, and this project has been going on for over two years, discussing, negotiating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2014)|
| 0:33:42| and actually Mr. Clayton has been looking at this investment, this gift, for much longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| So what we have before Council tonight is a purchase and sale agreement for 11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| The value of that land is approximately $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| although the demolition and abatement costs of the safety building, the police building, are between $700,000 and a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| So the value that we're looking at is approximately $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| His investment would be a $100 million construction design and construction investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| and he's committed to a $50 million endowment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| So we believe the return on investment is very beneficial to the city and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| We had a workshop on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| It's been discussed at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| We had a recent meeting where Mr. Clayton and Barbara McMurray actually showed the renderings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2068)|
| 0:34:37| and Mr. Clayton subsequently submitted a proposal, a final proposal, that Mayor Rojero reviewed and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| And just a few things about benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| So the payroll for the museum will be about $4.3 million in the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| They'll hire between 90 and 100 full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| It is a civic use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| We're very cognizant of the community that was destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| Urban renewal destroyed a neighborhood, an African-American neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| And I think all of us, I know, on City Council have discussed this at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| discussed this with Councilwoman McKenzie, Mayor Rojero, and Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| We're very aware of that and sensitive to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| and that's why we believe this type of use in the community is a great use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Mr. Clayton has committed, and I think you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| that low-income children, minors in the city, will not have barriers to this museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| They'll be able to attend for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| And so that commitment has been made since we started this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| and it is close to significant, some density, moderately dense housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| low- to moderate-income housing, as well as market-rate housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| It's located next to a transit line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| and so we believe the siting of this on this location has significant community benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| I think Dr. Lyons and Mayor Rojero and I are very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| with some of the community benefit agreements in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Those have often been tied to major, large projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| that have significant community pilots, tax incentives, infrastructure, road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| So again, the benefit is the museum and the access to low-income kids, children, minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2178)|
| 0:36:26| So what is on your agenda tonight is the purchase and sale agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| It would take about 120 days, if approved, for the city to do some one-lotting of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| close part of a road, and then convey that land over to the Clayton team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| And then Mr. Clayton, I believe at that point would feel comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| he'll be moving forward with design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| We will be keeping the community updated on that design throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| I think that's part of our job at the city is to hold those meetings, to give updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| especially once a final design is decided upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| One great aspect of this purchase and sale agreement and the lease, which is the next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| is that it gives us time for the police department to continue to operate on their building pad and city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2226)|
| 0:37:14| And although these projects are very separate, they were never linked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| it does give us an opportunity to finish Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| We should move forward with closing on Tenova within the next 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| And then we will commence on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| So the timing is almost perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| We didn't plan it that way, but we'll take credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| And so the timing is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| That is probably enough information for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| I guess I'll entertain questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| But again, I want to thank Mr. Clayton and his team for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| It really is a gift, and there is significant benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| And the designs, if you saw them, hopefully you saw them, I thought they were significant and wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| I also want to say, I said this the last time we had this discussion at council, that this is a gift to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| It's a gift to the neighborhood around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| When you think about the kids at Green School, the kids that live in the housing nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| to have a quality science museum right literally in their backyards, in their front yards, some of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| it's a major gift to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| And I want to thank, again, Mr. Clayton, Jim, thank you for this gift to all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| particularly the folks who live in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| And I think there is no greater testament to what happened, how you look back at the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| and what was taken away, that this is a pretty major gift to give back to a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| You had your chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Now it's my chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| You do not care about our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Stop saying this about our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| I would ask you to please stop your statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| What does your public say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| What does your community say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| You are one person, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| I am one of many, many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| I talk to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Now, so I stand by what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| It is a gift, and I appreciate the gift that you are making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| The contract also represents the city's interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| If you read the contract carefully, the city's interests are represented here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| and I think it's a good contract and encourage council to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Thank you, David, for the robust conversation we had many times, but particularly yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| as we went through the contract and we went through really the plans, long-term plans that you've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| Ms. Mayor, y'all have been working on for eight years plus, and we've had a lot of discussions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| There's no point in me reiterating all that, but I do appreciate the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| So it's about a total of 11 acres, and you say that you think it's valued at about $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| So you've kind of looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| You didn't have it appraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| Chip Berry is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Chip handles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| He's the deputy COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| He also has a real estate background, and he manages the city's real estate assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| So Chip took a building appraisal, and then we extrapolated that out onto the acreage around that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| It's just under, I think it's 10.43 acres, if I've got it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| And then that doesn't necessarily include the closed roads, so I rounded up to about 11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| And do you feel pretty confident that you can get them moved out in two years to the former Tenova site, to the new site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2423)|
| 0:40:32| Do you feel like construction will be done over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| You've got four months, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| The clock doesn't start ticking the way you explained it, right, for four months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| So the lease agreement, which is the second item you will consider on council, is so we'll convey the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| and from the time of closing, it will take us some time to work with MPC and city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| We need to one lot a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| We need to close a right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| We need to go through the MPC process, just like any other developer would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| That will take 90 to 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| And so we have time to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| That would happen towards the end of March, beginning of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| At that point, there's two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Our construction schedule, again, we plan to close on Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| It could be as early as Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Mark Mamentoff is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| Mark, that all weighs on his shoulder, so if the closing happens Friday, you can thank Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| If not, it's on Monday, so it depends on how hard he works this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| But you feel good about getting that construction done and timing it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| and you feel like you have enough flexibility that if you need more time, should you need more time, you've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| Yeah, and we've talked with Mr. Clayton and his team, with Jim, and he has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| now look, if I went in and said, Jim, I need three more years, I don't think he would say that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| But if I said I need two more months, I don't think there's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| But actually, our construction schedule from the time we mobilize in January to move in is approximately two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2507)|
| 0:41:56| And so, again, we're renovating three existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| And so we're not going from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| We're renovating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| We'll do abatement on one building, and then we will start interior demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| And we can focus on the KPD in first, and cork first, and then prioritize fire a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| So I feel very comfortable with the timing and the fact that we won't close until, again, March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| But signing this purchase and sale agreement gives Mr. Clayton the comfort that this city is committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| and supportive enough to spend real significant design dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| He's already spent significant dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| But to do detailed programming, to do detailed conceptual design, and move into design development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| we're talking millions of dollars, and he wants that commitment before he starts that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| So I do want to say to Mr. Clayton and his team, I mean, thank you for having the vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| I think that's one of the greatest legacies, you believe, to Knoxville is your vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| And I certainly didn't have that big a vision, and I appreciate people that do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| and I appreciate the resources you put together to bring this about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| And it's a huge advantage for Knoxville, and so we look forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Segueing on what Councilman Wallace just said, here we have an individual, Mr. Clayton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| who has been very successful in life, and we certainly celebrate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| This is not his first foray into public gifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| If you look at the Museum of Art, the Knoxville Museum of Art over by the World's Fair site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| he has been extremely instrumental in making that happen and keeping that viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| And so I'd like Mr. Wallace to celebrate people that are willing to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| and give back to the community that has helped them be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| and that's what I see in this event here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| So I'm very appreciative of everything you're bringing to the table and bringing this vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| as Councilman Wallace just said, to help Knoxville move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| It will, in my opinion, very heavily benefit the area in which you're placing this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Councilwoman Stang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| This museum, I guess it's $149 million that the city is getting ahead in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| Yeah, it will be a $100 million construction, and then there is a Mr. Clayton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| that doesn't want another organization to drain other philanthropic dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| so he's committed $50 million in an endowment to help cover the operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| One of the worst things you could do would be to build a $100 million museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| and then have to fundraise in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Mr. Clayton is one of that group of 15 or 20 people to get asked to support a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| Well, he's going to support this through his endowment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| So, yes, our million will leverage $100 million in construction and then $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| So if you want to subtract a million out of that, yeah, $149.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| I do want to show respect for the people that were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| and the neighborhood that was destroyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| and I know that that's a conversation that you guys have been having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| I like the idea of children being able to go in for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| Have you thought about how that would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| I know that's getting into the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Yeah, and so what Mr. Clayton has committed to that in development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| he has asked the city and Susan and Keith, who are working on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| he said, I want to commit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Tell me how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| And so he's asked the city to help him develop a model for making sure that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| and I'm not sure what that is yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I think we will work with Susan, the community, the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| How do we make sure that that happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| We've still got to figure that out, but he's made the commitment that's in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| I think one great thing would be to just call it Mountain View Science Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| In honor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Yeah, and we did discuss, and Mr. Clayton, we've had this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| that through public improvements in the area, as we look at our facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| or even the design of the museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| is there a way to tell the story of what urban renewal did to that community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| And again, going back to not only the historically African-American community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| but the Native American community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| is there a way through our improvements or through Mr. Clayton's improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| how do we design that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| And there is, you know, one thing that we did look at with Mr. Clayton and the designers was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| you know, we went out and not only looked at the museum site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| but we toured all of the neighborhoods with his designers that he brought into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| We looked at Morningside, we went across the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| we toured the two Austin homes and the reinvestment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| And so how do we look at the entire site in context?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| That's not necessarily Mr. Clayton's responsibility to make all those connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| but I know that his design team has that perspective of how do we improve access to the museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| And so, great points, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| It sounds like you guys want to work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| I'm hoping that maybe some of the people that have ideas on what would benefit the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| would discuss that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Yeah, I absolutely don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| I'm trying to set a time up to have lunch with Ms. Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| and we can talk more about what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| I'd like to thank Mr. Clayton and his team, and certainly being a big supporter of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| and think there's tremendous potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| But I have to say I do feel somewhat rushed on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| I mean, it's a huge parcel of land in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| It seems like the proposals just came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| There's three proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I'm sort of thinking back to the Supreme Court site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| We had a number of council workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| I mean, we even looked at how many windows were on a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| I mean, there was really looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| And really what concerns me about this, I mean, urban renewal was bad for so many reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| but in terms of urban design, it really killed this whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| And that area, you know, it's separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| We asked ULI to look at it back in 2014 or 15, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| And they proposed, you know, re-gridding it, making it more connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| And I guess I just have concern that Knoxville, we haven't been great at doing big buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| I feel like the convention center was overbuilt and not well connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| I feel like the Coliseum is not connected to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| The Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, you know, I want this to really be a success and connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| And it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Obviously I'm running off council in two weeks, but this next council is going to be lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| and the next administration is going to be living with this project for the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| And I think it makes sense for them to dig in, to dig into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| have a city council workshop, go over the proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| You know, one of the things, they look great to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| but one of the things they talk about is pedestrian walkways over roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| Well, most urban designers and planners will now tell you that's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| You want people on the streets if you want to create sort of street life and connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| Where are other opportunities in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| You know, there's a big parcel of land where the dog park was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| and I can't tell from what's being proposed what that's going to be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| But that on the ULI proposal would be a road to connect to Little Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| which would connect it to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| So, I mean, have we thought about those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| So it just seems like there's a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| Well, I guess my question is if we did postpone it for 28 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| is there what would be the drawback in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| And this, again, is something I'm very supportive of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| I want it to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| I want there to be a museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| I'm very appreciative of, you know, the work that's gone on to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| So your question about postponement, no, we've done two years of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| Actually, Mr. Clayton has done nearly a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| He is ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| He has reminded me that he is in his 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| and he wants to see this legacy happen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| But he's been working and committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| I do want to bring up the property up to Little Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Yes, we have looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| There is an option in the agreement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| There are restrictions on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| but the idea of connecting up via maybe a park space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| there are significant challenges with that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| from a topographical rock perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| But there are restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| That was actually deeded over to the city by Legacy Parks Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| as a donation, and they hold the conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| So the Clayton team is well aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| and there may be uses in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| potentially outdoor park spaces and connectivity up to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| But we're ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Mr. Clayton is ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| And the fact that he's committed this $100 million to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| and done the workshop, and we had a public meeting, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| We had two council members there and really had good feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| I think I've got that feedback I can send out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| It was very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| I had one question from an anonymous attendee that asked about people being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| to attend who are low income, and again, Mr. Clayton is committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| So I think we're absolutely ready to commit to this site for Mr. Clayton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Well, I mean, I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| It just seems, you know, this was announced in April of 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| and these proposals just came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| So to me it would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| I would sort of like to hear my colleagues' opinions that are staying on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| if you would like a council workshop on it before, you know, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| I mean, it's 12 acres of city property, you know, that's right next to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| and, you know, has a huge, and this is a huge, just in terms of acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| I mean, it's just a huge deal for the city, and I think, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| just to do due diligence, you want to get it right, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| I'm not going to be part of that, but would be open to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| and I'm happy to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| But if nobody else is interested in a city council workshop that I won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| I guess, be at, then I won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| I think that where I'm at with this is that we have had two years of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| We've gone through a lot of process on the actual site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| My understanding, I spoke with Mr. Brace earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| as council moves forward and as the city moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| there will be public infrastructure improvements that will have to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| I mean, that's just 11-acre site as it's being redeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| will require public infrastructure improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| So any of that public infrastructure improvement would have to come back to council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| I mean, if there's investment in roads, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| any of that then becomes part of public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| The site itself is going to a nonprofit that is investing $150 million in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| The public space that's around that site that connects the site to our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| is the responsibility of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| And so city council will have to take responsibility for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| and work with the foundation that has generously brought this project to our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| when I have no doubt that there are surrounding communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| that would love to have $150 million investment of a science museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| Thank you for coming to Knoxville with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| I think it's going to be a huge benefit to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| I understand your concern and echo the concern about making sure that it's connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| and I think that's our responsibility and it's our obligation to make sure that that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| as public infrastructure improvement goes along the side of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| I grew up in a household where we spoke about science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| Most dinners growing up, and that may be unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| but my father's a physicist and he's worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| 40 years, 30 years, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| So one of the things that I take away from that upbringing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| and I try to do this with my girls too, which is not easy since they're teenagers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| is to just instill this joy of learning and really the lifelong learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| And I really think that this museum is something that is really going to be a big benefit to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3293)|
| 0:55:02| And I think that it will help with instilling that lifelong learning desire in so many of our children and our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3302)|
| 0:55:13| And I'm just really, really excited about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| and just want to thank Mr. Clayton so much for this gift and for having this in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| And maybe some of the discussions we've had at the dinner table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| we can take them to the exhibits and say, hey, that's what we were talking about right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| I'd just like to say thank you to Mr. Clayton for considering and bringing this to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| We have talked about this extensively, and we've had workshops, and I know you guys have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| and your team, you guys have all invested a lot in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| I realize that you could put this somewhere else, and I think it's a great benefit for us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| I will also say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| I'm obviously a mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| I have a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Over time, I know lots of folks that would take their kids to Chattanooga, to the museum there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| or maybe even Sevierville or Atlanta to maybe the aquarium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| But I also know there are a lot of kids who can't afford to do that, and their parents can't take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| So I think it's an incredible benefit where this is being located so that these kids have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| to be able to see all of our kids here that couldn't necessarily go somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| whether it be prohibitive to get there by transportation and or the entry fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| And on that note, I will say, not my current circumstance, but as a kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| I would not have gotten to go to stuff like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| My dad didn't take us places really that cost money because he couldn't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| So I do understand that there are kids who won't be able to go because of entry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| and I hope that that is something that we talk about as we move forward with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| and consider the folks who don't have that opportunity, whose parents don't have the disposable income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| There's lots of places that we might go and we might look at the outside, but we never got to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| Things like the Georgia Aquarium are incredibly cost prohibitive for some families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| so please consider that as you're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| I am a science major. I think it's incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| My mom was a science major, and I realize a lot of kids don't choose careers in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| because they're not exposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| So I'm excited about that opportunity and exposing a lot of kids to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| that they wouldn't have got exposed to otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| So thank you so much, and I look forward to voting yes on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you. Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| So a couple of things that I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| First of all, in conversations throughout these last two years with the Clayton team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| I have heard a commitment to ensuring that low-income children who cannot afford to attend the museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| will have access to the museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| I've also heard from the Clayton team a commitment to hiring young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| and people from our East Knoxville community to work there at the museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| as it will be bringing jobs into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| This will be an asset and an opportunity for our children to be able to learn and thrive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| and to experience things that they otherwise would not have the opportunity to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| from Green School to Vine to Austinese specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Tonight I've heard some negative feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| This is the first time that I've heard any negative comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| and so I do appreciate those of you who showed up and shared your opinions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| This has been an ongoing topic, as we said, for two years, and we have had workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| I do think it would be beneficial to have a mini-workshop for our oncoming council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| to bring them up to speed on this project and where we are and how we got here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| As it relates to urban renewal and this particular land site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| during this two-year process I have been vocal and I have made it very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| that that is something very sensitive not just to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| but to the African-American community here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| I think that that is fully understood not only by this mayor and this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| but also Mr. Clayton and the Clayton team as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| When we talk about the history and preservation of that history of urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| I see that as something that is a responsibility for all of us to continue to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| so our children will not forget what happened here in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| and it was a very unfortunate part of our history, especially for black history here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3580)|
| 0:59:47| However, this is an opportunity for us to see some good come out of this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| that will give back opportunities to our community and especially to our young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| our children in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| The Beck Cultural Exchange Center has been in conversation concerning a cultural corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| to help preserve this history that I think will come before the next administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| and the next mayor as to how we help make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| which will, again, preserve that history of urban renewal, what was once there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| In addition to that, I think it is also a responsibility for us to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| to help preserve the history of urban renewal and the African-American community here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| that actually thrived, lived and thrived in that community and on that land at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| A lot of things have been said tonight that I take to heart, that I take to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3639)|
| 1:00:48| What I will say is that we would be hard-pressed to see anyone else come along and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| I want to give a gift of basically $149 million and put it in the East Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3655)|
| 1:01:07| And so because of that, and again, as I said, I'm very, very sensitive to our history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| I am in favor of this project, I am in favor of this process, and I will be voting for it to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3674)|
| 1:01:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| Any other discussion from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| So we have a motion and a second to approve 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3687)|

| 1:02:21| everyone who's dug in to really study this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| A lot of energy has been put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| A lot more energy will be put into this before it's completed, but we're on our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3750)|

| 1:03:26| Oh, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| I'm going to ask Becky Wade to talk a little bit about what our $4.2 million, what it's really leveraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| It's leveraging a lot bigger project than $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| I just want to kind of go over what the city's putting their money in for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| Many of you are aware that KCDC went through a master planning process for the Austin Homes site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| It involved a lot of community members, residents, stakeholders, and there were many, many meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| And the plan that came out of that process involves the redevelopment of the Austin Homes site where apartments are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3841)|
| 1:04:11| vacant apartments are now, and then the land adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| In total, as this is developed, and it will be developed over phases, there will be over 400 units back on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3857)|
| 1:04:27| And the city's contribution is assisting with the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| Just like we did in Five Points, the city will be providing new stormwater, new streets, new utilities, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3872)|
| 1:04:42| landscaping to enable this project to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| KCDC can access money to build housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| They can do that through the low-income housing tax credit program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| but the city really needs to join with them as a partner to enable this to be created back as a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| Ben Bentley is here from KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| If you have any other specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| Thank you, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Yeah, so our money's being put back in for infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| and I think this is a key point, that what the city invests in is roads and streets and utilities and no developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3913)|
| 1:05:21| It's not the responsibility of the developer, and they can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| So they're going to build the buildings, our $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| It's going to take more money in the future is what you're saying as this thing phases out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| This is a multimillion-dollar project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| Right now, the tax credits that KCDC has been awarded is $13 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| and that's just to cover the first phase of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| So, you know, our money is leveraged many, many, many times over with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3943)|
| 1:05:52| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=3955)|

| 1:07:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Maggie, just talk a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| They're going to rehab this building and then add on to it out the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Is that kind of what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| The building is located on Mineral Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| It's the former Associated Therapeutics building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| and the plan is for Helen Ross McNabb to develop 32 units inside the existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4053)|
| 1:07:41| and then add an addition of 18 units next door right in the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| And the units there are being developed for very low-income senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| Fifty percent of the area median income are below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| The affordability period will be for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| and additional services will be provided to enable housing stability for the seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| So how will public transit work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| That's almost a dead-end road up there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| Will they have other options available to them or public transit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| I can let Jerry Vagner's here from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| He can address that or Houston Smelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| I haven't heard from them in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4115)|

| 1:08:43| Councilperson, I wanted to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| We have field staff case managers who are available to do transportation to appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| One of the things that we'll provide at this particular site is support services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| A number of people who have medical conditions, complex care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| are going to need assistance getting to appointments and getting medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| So our staff will be onsite to provide support, and then field staff will also be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| There is public transportation out on the main avenue, but it is a fair walk for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| So we need to make that accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4155)|

| 1:10:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Council, model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Yeah, I just have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| So, Mr. Aggerman, you and I have talked about this a couple of times, and Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| I mean, what exactly this road and what are we getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| I mean, we're not spending $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| We're getting 20% of that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| We're basically spending $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Are we spending $5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| What are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Resolution's for 5.4, so are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| The resolution is for the complete cost, so we're putting in $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| We're putting in $1 million, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| What we get out of this is reconnecting an area that was kind of chopped up by construction of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4250)|
| 1:10:59| There's really bad connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| It's all industrially zoned and poorly utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| This provides a lot of opportunity for redevelopment for zoning appropriate activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4270)|
| 1:11:19| So will this require, or will it need, or will it be something to look forward to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| Will I have to create a redevelopment district to encourage industrial development there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| Have you all looked down that path yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| That's out of my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| We don't have one now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| I think we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| It was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| We talked about the history earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Actually, back when Mayor Haslam was here, we worked with, a number of us, Lions and Development Corp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| and others looked at what were the available industrial properties, remnant parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4310)|
| 1:11:57| that could be developed for economic development purposes in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| And we looked along a rail and along 275 and 40 East at available properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| And this was the culmination of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| So it's really going to open that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| I think the next administration is going to have to determine how you actually work towards additional resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| to develop those and entice people into those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| But, you know, you've got a rail line, you've got 275, you're going to have this access road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| What we would hope to happen is the market would start to consolidate many of those remnant properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| into developable sites for higher and better uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| We certainly need development of industrial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| And so, I mean, I think it's a good move and certainly worth a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| It's really a million is really what we're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| And, Mayor, this may be for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Is this a project that we could potentially look to the chamber to help as far as marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| and exploration to try to entice and encourage businesses to look at this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Remember, this is privately owned property, but we're creating access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| which would then mean that there's opportunities for new development to happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| So this would really be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| I mean, the adjacent property is privately owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| This would definitely be a plus for the city as well as creating and bringing in new jobs, as David said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| Yeah, I can remember, you know, years ago, as Mr. Brace mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| this is really the vision of where are the redevelopment opportunities within our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| One was along the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| This is under Haslam's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| The other is along I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| You've got all that land that's been cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| So this, we talked about this has been ten years in the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| Different reasons why it's taken a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| but the last so many years has been tied up directly in right-of-way acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| and getting things ready to where now we can go and actually build the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| But it's something we've had our sites on and been working on for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| and it will create opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| You know, we, the Chamber Development Corp, all of them work with us to identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| They're always looking for sites, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4445)|

| 1:16:36| and raised some funds to renovate the house that was on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4596)|

| 1:18:05| It's been a good partner to the community, to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4685)|

| 1:21:17| Correct me if I'm wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| But I urge you to postpone the purchase until we can add language stipulating safe and fair working conditions for all workers at the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4880)|
| 1:21:28| It's critical that we uplift the working class through our transition to a zero-carbon economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| This will be many of y'all's last month in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| Do you want to go out standing on the side of exploited workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| or will you choose to invest our tax dollars in a way that enables the abuse of workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| Second, Charles Crooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| My name is Charles Crooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| I'm from the 1628 Palmetto Trail, Anniston, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| I found it important enough to drive up here to speak on this subject here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| As Noah said, we're asking you to postpone the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| I am an organizer for Jobs for America in Anniston, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| And we've done extensive interviews with various workers from the plant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| And as Noah said, those things that he stated, they are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| And we're asking to postpone the vote to help us to enforce, which we are fighting for in Anniston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| a community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| We're asking your help here in Knoxville to help us blaze a way for the southern manufacturers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4952)|
| 1:22:43| that are coming to our states, southern states, and opening up shop and treating workers unfairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| Again, I ask you for your support and thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| Ms. Crooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| Virginia Crooms, 1628 Palmetto Trail, Anniston, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| I am a community organizer with Jobs to Move America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| And I am, we just want the manufacturing companies to be good neighbors to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=4998)|
| 1:23:26| They are coming down south and they are creating jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| And we just want them to be good neighbors and we want them to help us help our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5011)|
| 1:23:40| Because they have a manufacturing 750 employees right in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| And we want to ensure that the people that live in our community have a livable wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5027)|
| 1:23:59| create good jobs, safe jobs, and we just want to ask that you delay the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| Because, you know, the manufacturer is, they receive billions of dollars of public incentives and tax abatements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5046)|
| 1:24:18| They are not very transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| And we want to ensure that our community thrives with them coming down south and making Alabama| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5063)|
| 1:24:33| and Mississippi the manufacturing towns and cities of the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| We want to make sure that we don't become another Michigan where these jobs, all the manufacturers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5079)|
| 1:24:47| were in Michigan, but now, you know, they closed shop and left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| And then the people there suffered greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| Unfortunately, me and my husband, we came from Michigan prior to moving to Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| And we want them to come and create the jobs, but we want them to be good neighbors to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| Because we live there in that city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| We need a lot of things to help us survive this economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| So a community benefits agreement, I know the big word that's going around is a quid pro quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5118)|
| 1:25:26| You give me something, I get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| Why not? It's in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| We need it, we deserve it, the workers deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| It's the wrong way, we don't like your traffic, but we made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| And thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5146)|
| 1:25:54| Delay the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| I want to personally thank the Croons family for driving here today so that you could speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| I know that we don't normally ask questions of people who come up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| I would be interested to know if there have been any EEOC complaints that have been filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| any complaints filed with local NAACP chapters or Urban League chapters in, I think you said Alabama and Mississippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5175)|
| 1:26:25| or the two states where they have plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| Well, Alabama, there's plants pretty much all over the U.S., but in the southern region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| that we have here are Alabama and I believe there's one in Kentucky also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| What you just asked about the complaints, filing complaints, workers are afraid of retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| The minute that they complain, retaliation may not happen right then and there for the workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| but over time they are pretty much stressed at the point that they either quit or are fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| I am an ex-worker from that plant, so I can tell you firsthand of these things that are happening within that plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| I don't want to go into detail about how that plant operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| We have just a snippet of it in this report here that I can share with the council members, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| But workers are afraid of being retaliated against, of speaking out, safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5236)|
| 1:27:24| Just the fear is real with the workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| And that is understandable. I can definitely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| They are going to have to step up and there could be some anonymity things that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| But I would encourage them to please contact their EEOC offices for the state and share those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5260)|
| 1:27:47| because that is the best way to really make a difference and to hold companies accountable on that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5267)|
| 1:27:54| And then also speaking to the legislative bodies in the local cities as well as the capitals of those states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| I think would be very beneficial as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| But again, thank you all very much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| And if you would like to share that information with us, our city recorder will take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| But thank you very much, and safe travel home to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5304)|
| 1:28:54| I think we need to think about if we are hurting another city just to help our city, what are we really doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| So now here we are after two years of working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| What does this, are we saying that we're going to get, is this giving us four or are we making the deal for 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5346)|
| 1:29:15| This is for four, and Mr. Boyce Evans is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| Deputy Finance Director, and Ms. Penny Owens is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| She basically handles purchasing, so yeah, this is for four at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| Should there be additional dollars, we could procure additional units, but this is for the initial four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| Is that correct, Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| Yes, sir, Boyce Evans, Deputy Finance Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| We could buy another eight if a grant comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| It has not come through yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| We have not received it, and that's simply because the federal government hadn't passed the budget and appropriated the funds for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| Once that happens, that should come through, and we should be able to get another eight more off of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| which leaves you with, out of 25, another 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| If someday over the rainbow and we get enough grants and so forth, we may be able to buy those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| But right now, what you've got in front of you is to buy four with the funds available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5418)|
| 1:30:27| with the option to buy up to a total of 25 later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| And just, ma'am, one thing you talked about, when you talked about the reputation and performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| I hate to tell you, but it's not really in the context that you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| The context that that's looking at right here, reputation, performance, is really the reputation with other cities on how well their bus performs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5443)|
| 1:30:53| That's what we're looking at, because we're trying to get the best product at the best price for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5453)|
| 1:31:00| So if we want to get these, whatever you call them, community benefit packages and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5460)|
| 1:31:07| that's something we'd have to look at over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| But that was not even thought about or considered in this procurement, nor, well, it just wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| That's just never been an issue if they're a good employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| Never. I was a purchasing agent for over 12 years, never had an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| Now, there are restrictions on what we can do as far as when we're purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| Yeah, and I think what we talked about was, and I think Councilwoman Singh had asked to sit down with the law department, with purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5494)|
| 1:31:42| to better understand the restrictions that are placed on local governments from the state procurement perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| And there are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| And so I think that's something that we can look into, and I think we also talked about, you know, could we take a deeper dive into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| We have a $25 million investment in Alabama and the 750 jobs, and if there's been issues, could we take a deeper dive and talk about that later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| And so we're more than willing to sit down and dialogue and schedule that meeting with purchasing and with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| So it's something that we cannot take into consideration when we're making, buying something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| Well, I think it depends on what Council would perhaps want us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| State-wise, there is nothing restricting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| Well, I think it depends on the specific situation about reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| I think we've heard some concerns about discrimination and concerns about this plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| I think what we had talked about, there are restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| And Mr. Evans, you know, maybe an example of if the city wanted to require only union plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| We're not allowed to engage in preferential bidding, preferential procurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| In other words, we can't, you know, award contracts based on the color of their skin, their gender, their socioeconomic status, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5574)|
| 1:33:05| Preferential bidding by the state of Tennessee is forbidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| And there's a whole lot of other restrictions the state has in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| Generally speaking, though, they go to promote fair and open competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| But we could sit down and look at those other restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| Yeah, what we talked about when this question was raised this afternoon was that for purchasing to look into exactly how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| to look out nationally with community benefit agreements and how that ties in with city purchasing or state requirements for purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5612)|
| 1:33:41| I think this is a whole discussion that can occur if the next Council chooses to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| I certainly understand the croons coming and asking us to delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| And as Mr. Nordstrom mentioned, I've worked with farm workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| We had a national boycott of grapes, lettuce, and Gala wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| Our strategy was to put pressure on local grocery stores to not purchase certain California-made products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| because farm workers were trying to win very basic human living conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| And pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| So it's, you know, I certainly understand the strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| To me, the concern now is that you really, if you're going to have a whole purchasing process like we have had for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| and then to spring community benefits agreements on it, then that undermines the purchasing process that we've just had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| which was fair and a lot of people invested, a lot of organizations, you know, companies invested a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| as all of them did in bidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| We need to know what the rules are legally in terms of when you've been through a process like this to then all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| to go back on it because of something that was not considered not part of the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| That's what I've asked the purchasing department, really take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| If this Council chooses, wants to decide, make future decisions based on these types of factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| then we need to present this going in on an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| You know, that this is what Council will be considered or these are what the points will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| But I've asked Mr. Evans to start looking into that, should the future administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| and this future Council want to make that a part of the whole procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| We need to know legally what can be done or not, how other communities have approached this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| and I did some quick research this afternoon and I know it's being done in different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| So it's something that I would encourage Council to vote for this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| based on the process that's gone on in good faith for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| but to have that discussion and decide in the future what you might want to do and in the realm of what's legally possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| I understand that we can't, after two years of work, and then use a criteria that we weren't using before and change our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| But we are the typical customer for these type of groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| So if we made any sort of statement or started questioning any part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| I think it will make a big impact in supporting the workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| So which could also be, I agree, and I think that could also be done if this Council chooses to send by resolution or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| send a letter that raises those issues, knowing that we're purchasing four now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| we hope to get the money to purchase eight more, and to start putting that pressure that more and more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| particularly in the South, are looking at what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| I think that's totally appropriate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| I just wanted to add, and that would go forward to the company, there is a nondiscrimination clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| So we would be within our rights to request, I mean, it's within the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| So if we wanted to request documentation to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| ensure that they are following our contract, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| There's nothing that would prevent us from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| One, yes, we have every right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| And also, I just remembered an esoteric part of the Code of Ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| which says that anybody that we're doing business with, we have the right to go and inspect their plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| or wherever they're manufactured, distributed from, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| So, I mean, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| I know we're already going to go down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| We always, folks from CAT, always go to, just like the fire department goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| and inspects the manufacture of the fire trucks, CAT does the same thing for buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| So, I mean, we're already going to go down there, and, you know, we could look for certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| We just need some time to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| Heck, it takes eight months to a year to manufacture these buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| so it's not like we've got to roll it out real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| We can do that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| But, yes, this is in here, and if you violate it, you can breach the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| I think, you know, I would concur with Councilwoman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| and just sometimes asking the question, you know, this is in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| and we would like you to submit documentation that supports, you know, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| a report, something that's, it raises a red flag for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| There are some concerns that have been brought to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| We're doing business with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| We want to make sure you're in compliance with these sections of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| So, Boyce, is there something that we should do to amend to make sure that happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5935)|
| 1:39:03| Or are we just going to go on a leap of faith here that the due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| and the inspections are going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| Basically, the allegations have been presented to us, and at this point they are allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5949)|
| 1:39:17| The contract with Los Angeles, which is where the organizing group had bigger concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5957)|
| 1:39:25| was completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| They had a community agreement, and they were awarded some attorney's fees from charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5966)|
| 1:39:33| or from court, from a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| My recommendation would be to approve what you have before you, but to do what I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| or what I suggested a minute ago, which is when we do our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| there's a couple visits I think we make to a manufacturer for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| So you always do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| The fact that we tell them in advance, we're coming down there, and oh, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| this is something we want to look at, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| And we need to figure out who the right people would be to be on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| a team that looked at these type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| So it's not a you might do it, it's you're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| We are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| I think we go twice for fire trucks, and I think we go twice for buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| Like the pre-design, and then partway through building it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| I may be off, but I'm not off much anyway, because we're making such a big investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| But all you've got to do is, you know, we're looking at certain things in those visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| I've been on one before down to Baton Rouge where they're, okay, how is it designed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| Is there other things that we need on it that we didn't heretofore think about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| That type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| You know, what's the strength of the aluminum or steel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Looking at all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| But in this case, instead of just straight looking at the product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| maybe you're looking at the plant to make sure that they're complying with that excerpt from the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6058)|
| 1:41:08| Mayor, I think we can make a commitment to council that during the normal visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| during the manufacturing inspection, we can raise with the management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| and the executives their concerns that have been raised during this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| It would be nice with the folks who came up from Madison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| if they had a list and maybe that's in the report you handed to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| so we could ask specifically about some of their concerns so they know we're thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| But we'll make that commitment, Mayor, if you would like us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| That's the wish of council, yes, and me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| Okay, any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| David, one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| Can you just ask it after it's over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| Just stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| You can ask him a question after it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| Council's ready to vote, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Stick around and ask the question afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| 12A is an ordinance to change the street name of a portion of Stonewall Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| between New York Avenue and Ohio Avenue to Gloria Garner Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| Mark Campin, City Council Applicant, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| I don't know if anybody from friends or family, Ms. Garner's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| Is there anybody, Mr. Kyle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Any folks from Gloria Garner's family here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| I don't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Well, she's not in great health, but I'm certain there will be an unveiling when the name changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| and I would like to read a portion of this if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| Well, make your motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Oh, yeah, motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| And also I would like a motion to pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| Okay, that will be an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| So we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| So we have an amendment to pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| I'll make a motion for an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| You made the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| Okay, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| Would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6185)|

| 1:45:00| able to honor her with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6300)|

| 1:46:08| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Then I want to offer an amendment to be read on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| Okay, so we will first vote that this be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| Eric, before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| I'm going to have to abstain on this one as well because my wife works for the MUSE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| All right, so we're voting on the amendment, which is to pass this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| That would make it four times you all would have voted on it because it was just in the budget amendment twice and then now today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6389)|
| 1:46:37| So there's been plenty of review of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6401)|

| 1:46:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| And that passes on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6411)|

| 1:47:07| a recovery community center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6429)|

| 1:47:11| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| Oh, I just wanted to hear some about what the Gateway was, what these funds are going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| I know that the Director of MDC is here, if she wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| Where's Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6444)|
| 1:47:35| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Karen Pershing, Executive Director of Metro Drug Coalition, 3930 Topside Road, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6458)|
| 1:47:47| The Gateway is a recovery community center that we are wishing to establish in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| We have found a building on West 5th Avenue in which to purchase the owners of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6475)|
| 1:48:03| The value is $900,000, the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| They are offering it to us for, originally it was $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| After our breakfast, kickoff breakfast that we had in October, they came to us and lowered the price for $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6493)|
| 1:48:22| So we've been very blessed through this whole process to have a community that is really rallying behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6502)|
| 1:48:30| The idea is to really create a space in this community for people in the early stages of recovery to connect back to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6510)|
| 1:48:41| and to have the resources available under one roof in order to rebuild their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6521)|
| 1:48:48| and to also have opportunities for families to learn how to best manage and care for a loved one who may be in active addiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6528)|
| 1:48:59| and also how to support a loved one who is in recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| I've already had people come to the table saying they're willing to provide physical activity classes for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6544)|
| 1:49:13| art classes and therapy for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| It's just been amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Recovery support groups, I want to lead a support group when you get this open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| And this is really what we were hoping for is that it's really a place where the whole community comes together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6564)|
| 1:49:31| using existing assets that we already have but bringing them collectively towards a very vulnerable population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6571)|
| 1:49:39| that really needs services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| People coming out of treatment, it takes about 18 to 24 months for an addicted brain to heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6582)|
| 1:49:50| We're giving them roughly about 30 days of treatment if they're lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| And so when they first come out of treatment, they're extremely vulnerable to relapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| And so if we can keep them connected to things like recovery meetings, recovery coaching services and peer mentoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6599)|
| 1:50:08| hopefully we can change the trajectory and we can create more space for individuals to get help and care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6608)|
| 1:50:18| without having to expand access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| Because some of the same people are rotating in and out of our treatment beds right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| because they're continuing to relapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| So we're very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| It's something we've been researching for over two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| And we're looking forward to getting this open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| So you're moving your offices there as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| Part of this, too, is decreasing stigma around substance use disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| So we don't want it to be MDC over here and the gateway here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| We want us to all be under the same roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| So when people come and visit me as the executive director, they're also walking through the gateway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| and they're seeing us people just like you and me that are in there utilizing those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| So that was really important to us to be able to walk the walk and be able to put this in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6664)|
| 1:51:12| And the full cost that you're estimating right now for the renovations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| The full cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Purchase and renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| Yeah, purchase and renovation is going to be around $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| So we've still got a ways to go to raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| This is a way to help jump start and leverage additional funding by us coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| As you all know, the city and the county together have been really focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| particularly Mayor Jacobs and I and staff and council and commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| focused on addressing addiction issues from how do we prevent, how do we treat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| and then how do we support those in recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| And so this is a really needed missing piece, as you know, in the kind of work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| So we were glad to help because they need to purchase this building before the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| And then they'll go ahead and move their offices in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| As they raise money, you're able to convert the rest of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| So, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| So I want to amend the motion to be read on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| So any other questions about what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| Thanks for your leadership on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| Really do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| So first we will vote on the amendment, which is to pass this on the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| Again, this saves it from being voted on a fourth time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6743)|
| 1:52:30| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| And then on the original motion as amended, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| That passes as well on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| And to the MDC staff who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| We're now to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| There's only one group that signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| And hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| I think they're stepping right outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6776)|
| 1:53:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| Come on, please, to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6793)|
| 1:53:21| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| These are a bunch of guys I went to college with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| Be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Please, each of you, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| And if you see the timer, if each need five minutes, we'll give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| But we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Oh, look at the shirt that he has on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| My name is Glenn Bagby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| I live in Lexington, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| I started college with Finbar and Bruce in the fall of 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6825)|
| 1:53:53| My name is Bruce Davis from Lexington, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| Glenn and I are both members of the Kentucky Bar and Lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| but we will quickly say we're not admitted in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| So you can't sue us for malpractice tonight because we're not lawyers here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| Somebody told us that Finbar is in his last ñ this is his next to last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| and we wanted to come down and celebrate Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| And we looked at other vistas for Finbar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| and we thought maybe this would be an appropriate visit for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| So there's a petition in the lobby if you want to sign the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| We love you, Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| Oh, thank you all for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| I wanted to say how proud we are of Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| When we were students at Transylvania University in Lexington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| there's also a University of Kentucky in Lexington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| but Transylvania is the one that we're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| When we were students there, we knew that Finbar had leadership qualities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| because he became president of the student government there at Transylvania University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6888)|
| 1:54:53| and we knew he was going on to great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| And we've always admired him as we admire all of you here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| who have chosen to get into the arena and put yourselves forth when you run for election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| And the only time I decided I might run, which I never did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| was if I wanted to confess all my sins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| because I knew that there would be things brought up that I had long forgotten about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| So thank you, Finbar, for your service to Knoxville and to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| and to all of you all for your service to this great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| Well, Glenn and Bruce, thank you all so much for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| I will buy you a glass of wine afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| I was going to say the drinks are on Finbar, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| And thank you, Ellen, for your, what's the word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191203?start=6937)|
