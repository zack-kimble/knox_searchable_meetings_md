| 0:08:08| hillside task force recommendations that are currently, I guess, will have been dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| with by MPC by that date that should be coming up on our agenda in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=494)|

| 0:11:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| There are several items right after this 11E that are of the same type, subject matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| and it might be helpful if we ask Ms. Rojero to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| As I look through those, the question occurred to me is, why are there different numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| of homes at different rates of contribution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| And she's given a very good explanation, but it was not apparent to me in reading the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| and maybe it would help others who have been trying to follow the agenda to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| and explain to us, if you would, Ms. Rojero, what we're doing as we make these grants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| these entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| First of all, these are the home funds that you all approved, the big picture every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| in our annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| We set aside a certain amount of dollars, as required by HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| There's actually a minimum amount, at least 15% of our home dollars that has to be set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| aside for community housing development organizations, which we call CHODOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| And so we have four CHODOs in Knoxville, and you have those four resolutions in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| you to allocate some funds for each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| We send out an application form to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| They fill it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| They request a certain amount of money based on the number of houses they think they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| complete over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| We look at those applications and talk to them about the other available funds they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Some organizations that have been around longer may have access to different additional sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| They may have some of their own money, and because of the number of projects they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| completed and sold and then have the returns, the proceeds from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| So they're all in a little different financial situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Also the size of the house may vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| You know, the cost of the actual home that they're building may vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| And so we weigh all of that and then, you know, put together this and allocate the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| that we have based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| And if you divide this out to the price per unit, that doesn't really reflect the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| of the individual home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| This is a way of helping to fund these CHODOs to get their job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Each of these will leverage other dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| So the actual cost of the house will probably be more, you know, will be more than each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| That's the part I found confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| They have other sources of funding generally, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| And these funds, when the house is sold, go back into the program, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| And this is where, if you get into the details of the contract, this is just setting aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| the money for each of these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| They have to come back with specific lots, specific activities or housing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| And we can structure it as a loan that they pay us back or we can structure it so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| any proceeds they keep but they reinvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| And that's typically what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| We have some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| But either way, the money gets reinvested again into the same kind of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Thank you so much for your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| How much money total do you have in this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| In the CHODOs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| You mean just this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| The annual plan had a total of $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| We had some unallocated funds from the previous year, which we are adding to this, which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| can do according to HUD regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| And so we are basically allocating all of the money right now that we have set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=912)|
| 0:15:21| for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Is that the same amount each year set aside or does it vary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| No, it varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| We have to have a minimum of 15% of the allocation that we get for home, which can vary each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| It's been running $1.3 million, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| I don't have that in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| But we do at least 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| We often do more than that, actually, more than the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=945)|

| 0:17:22| As I was looking through this package, Mr. King, I guess my question was, is this not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| a capability we can have in-house to do this modeling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| We went out and looked for someone who's somewhat of a specialist in this, but it is like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| quarter of a million dollars plus, and I was just curious if you had or could get salaried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| engineers to do that at less expense to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| Well, actually, probably before you owned council, we've had a similar discussion, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| the situation is we have already done the water quantity model on First Creek by consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| We're proposing to do the water quality model by consultant on First and Whites Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| We're going to have to do that on all our creeks for our stormwater permit, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| hired an engineer on staff that we're going to train to take those models that the consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| prepares for us and expand those to other creeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| I notice in the package that they're supposed to come back and give you some training and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| even help with the first stab at your own model downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1109)|

| 0:19:23| On projects such as this, whether it's streets or sidewalks, how is KUB involved in regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| to helping fund any of the repair work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Steve, do you want to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| On the, in this particular project, KUB's cost is $137,000, and that's primarily for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:45| a water line that they want to replace during our project, and it's also for their pro-rata| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| share of repairing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| So they do participate in sidewalk and street repair on projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| They're not participating in the sidewalk part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| They are participating in the street repair, but that's as a result of the installation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1205)|

| 0:20:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| If I could ask Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Steve, I was curious, the last contract we just approved, the bids were really pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| close within about $20,000 or $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| On this one, the second bidder was like $200,000 higher, and I was just curious as to why the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| spread was so wide, whether we just case of someone being hungrier than the other, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| is there some reason why the bid is that dramatically different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:45| It's very difficult to try to understand how contractors, how they bid, what they bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| We have had some good experience with the particular low bidder on this project, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| we do feel comfortable that he can do the job properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| So it may be their experience level enables them to use a sharper pencil in figuring out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| It could be that another contractor had more work and just wasn't as honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1271)|

| 0:21:39| It says to repair 11 nuts at various locations that were either missing or cracked, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:47| question I had is who did the job in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| And I mean, if we're replacing nuts that were never there, we're spending $42,450, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| wonder what responsibility or have we looked into the responsibility of the original contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| especially if we're missing pieces that aren't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| I realize this is kind of a nuts and bolts situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| At least nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Well, if you recall, the Gay Street Bridge over the river was rehabilitated several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| ago through a federal grant that TDOT administered the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| For whatever reason, these nuts weren't replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| And as we've gotten subsequent bridge inspections, they've been noted, and we felt like it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| critical before the Henley Bridge closes that we repair this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| Unfortunately, there is no warranty that we can go back that far, but we are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:54| about it and we've expressed our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| TDOT taking any responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1376)|

| 0:23:09| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Do we have like a lessons learned from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| I mean, is it better inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| What do we do to avoid that kind of thing from happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Obviously, it's something you've got to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| You can't ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| And if you don't have a warranty to go back on, then this comes out of your pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1396)|

| 0:23:35| Back in those days, they administered the contract, provided the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| Now we would be more directly involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| So it really arises because they were managing the contract and not the city itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Well, they did what they did based on advice from their consultant, I'm told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1437)|

| 0:23:59| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Mr. King, I was just curious about the bridge inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| How often is that done, that these bridges are inspected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| How often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| It's done every two years and that's required by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| And TDOT has that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| If a bridge falls below a certain standard as far as its rating, then they can move that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:23| We have had some that have been done every six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| The Gay Street Bridge, before it was repaired, they were inspecting it every six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| So the inspection is done by TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1472)|

| 0:25:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| When I read over this, I saw what appears to be a really good square foot per foot price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1552)|
| 0:26:01| and I was curious, how much square footage of properties does the city lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| Someone have that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1568)|

| 0:26:14| I'm just curious as to how much, and then also the square footage, the differences in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| the prices in terms of what we have, if we could get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1579)|

| 0:26:43| that off the top of his head, so it's worth asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| I just don't, I don't, I apologize, I don't know that broken down, but if you'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1607)|

| 0:27:38| It's helping kids before they go wrong, and so it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1662)|

| 0:30:22| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Is Mr. Hill here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| I was reading this material and the extra stuff you sent me, the bid proposal information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| I'm curious, how much is this overall project estimated to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:42| I mean, we're doing phase one of a three-phase engineering process, and we'll have a construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| I think I saw a number like $10 million, but I wasn't sure if that was the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| I mean, do we know the scope of what we're starting by doing this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| I mean, it's a great program, and I don't have a problem with it, but I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| understand we're stepping into the pool, and how deep is it, is kind of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| I guess my first question to you, sir, would be, are you talking about construction costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| or just the professional services contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Well, I thought the professional services was about a million if you added the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| phases, more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Well, I've cautioned that it'll probably be more than that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| But the overall bridge, including the design work, what are we talking, design and construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| I realize it's too soon to have detailed drawings to know exactly how to price it, but it must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| have some general scope that you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Based on a lot of the discussion that has occurred, I think we're talking about $10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| to $12 million or up, in terms of the total project cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| So that's the order of magnitude kind of thing that we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| And we're hoping to get some federal funding to continue this effort as we, what, improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| pedestrian access to both UT and South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| As indicated in the staff report, we do have federal highways concurrence that we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| a $7 million federal grant toward construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| It was a generic earmark you just approved in this year's budget, the last of five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| of matching funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| So that money is available, but it is not committed specifically to the bridge at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| point, although we do know that the funds are eligible for bridge construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Well, thank you very much for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Councilman Whitelaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Is it still, as our information sheet indicates, a public preference that the bridge have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:50| iconic design element?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Well, one of the things that we've put into the scope of work, and this is not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| be, I think, an easy task, because everybody wants to see something that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| There will be alternatives generated, but one of the things that we've worked out through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| the negotiations on the scope of work is the consultant team will always have estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| of probable cost tied to the different alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| So we are going to have to make a decision as a community what we think we can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| and what we want to see extending out over the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| It seems like design is always the first thing to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Well, it's a bridge that we're going to live with and enjoy and look at, and it enhances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:42| both the view from both sides of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| The aesthetic design seems real important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| It's important to me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| One answer I would give you, and it's kind of tied maybe as a component of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| involvement, because I had a similar question asked of is there a proper opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| public dialogue to determine what we really want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| And my answer at the time was, number one, you will see some alternatives generated so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| that you can compare and decide what you would prefer and see what the rest of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| is reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Before any decisions are made to go into detailed design and construction documentation, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| have to come back to city council with a revised scope and a budget, and if at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| time council decides there needs to be more work done or there needs to be some determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| of trying to reach a funding amount needed to do what this community wants, that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| point where you can start to take a second look at the project and decide is this the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| direction we want to go or do we need to back up a little bit and figure out what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| really want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| And so the team will generate the design options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| I mean, Sanders-Pace is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| It's actually Lowry and Associates' lead firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| They are actually the bridge designing firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Mr. Richard Lowry is in the audience if you'd like to ask him any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| And there are other members of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Mr. Lowry, could you stand up just so council members can see you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Yeah, I'd love for you to come forward, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| If you could give us your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| My name is Richard Lowry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| I'm president of Lowry and Associates from Alexandria, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| Well, first off, congratulations on putting together a good team, and I hope you're committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| to giving us something that we can be proud of, something that's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| And I personally believe that we can provide something aesthetic, something pleasing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| appearance with and combined with economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| And it's a goal that our company has and a goal that I have personally and I've had through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| the years through my training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| So that's kind of my dedication, and I'm committed to providing you something nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| So Sanders-Pace Architecture, they'll be the people on your team generating the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Sanders-Pace and Carol R. Johnson and Associates are two architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| We have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Carol R. Johnson is really a landscape architect, Sanders-Pace is a regular architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| Well, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Did you come here all the way from Virginia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| I like this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Thank you, Mr. Lowry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Mr. Dellibobi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Before he goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Before you leave, as long as you're up there at the microphone, I wouldn't drag you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| from the stands again, but I was curious as I read through some of the information in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| the package that there were a number of core drillings being done by SM&E for the approaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| on either side or the landings, if you will, on the north side by UT and the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| in the waterfront project, and it indicated there was only one core drilling for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| of the underwater piers, and I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| To me, that would be the biggest unknown, and I didn't know why there were fewer core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| drillings for the support piers in the middle of the river, so if you could just give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| a layman's version of that, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Well, basically, we have, you know, it depends upon the final layout that Dave is talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| about because how many piers, but we may only have two or three piers or four piers at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:47| most in the river because there is, like, a 400-foot span that has to get over the channel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| which takes up a major portion of the river, so, you know, there aren't that many piers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| but a good foundation investigation in each one of the main piers is important, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| would definitely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| So the numbers are not as significant as how you do the individual sampling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| And the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Councilman Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| I would just be curious if there were some of your work that we could view online, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| out of curiosity, some of your most prized works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| Well, I'm kind of an economical firm, and I don't have a website, but I can give Dave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| information, and I believe he does already have our qualification statement, which you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| could get from Dave, or I can supply him a new edition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| Nick, I've got it in PDF, and I can send it to you if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| I tried sending it to you, Councilman, and your email wouldn't accept it, but I can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2338)|

| 0:39:26| I realize this is sort of a technical shifting of the budget to cover the downtown sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| repair higher cost, but can, if Jim is here, or maybe Larry, someone can tell me, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2372)|

| 0:39:44| or is that something we won't need in this particular time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| We were shifting dollars to a place where they're needed more, but I didn't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2388)|

| 0:39:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Council Member DelVolpi, I'm awake now, and in answer to your question, yes, it's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:08| belief that those funds that we had set aside for Jackson Avenue were general in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| and anticipated activity that we don't see happening at this point in time, and so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| is wise for us to move those funds to another project that is in the downtown core, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| that's what we have done, or what we're recommending to council tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2426)|

| 0:42:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| This is a technical one and I don't know if I understood it right or not, but looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| through the paperwork, it looks like we have an engineer's note, Batson, Himes, Norvell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| and Poe writes a letter saying the 323 feet that is laced throughout the ordinance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2578)|

| 0:43:30| We'll have to check with MPC because what we prepare is based on the information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| we get from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2614)|

| 0:44:21| They were fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2661)|

| 0:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Well, it may be that I was reading the whereas information and the cover memo, I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| that the operative section talks about 340, Section 1 talks about 346 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| Maybe that's the other stuff that's just historical, but I was just concerned that we were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| to get the numbers wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2685)|

| 0:45:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| 12F is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northeast side of Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| east side of Keith Avenue from R2 to C3 District, this and that antiques applicant, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| We do have someone at the podium signed up to speak, Mr., let me just, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| My name is John Valiant, 800 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| I represent Ann Brummet, who is the owner of This and That Antiques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| I understand there may be some opposition here also, but we do have a number of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| if you'd stand up, that are here in favor of this particular zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| The history of this, I'll be very brief, I know time is important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Ms. Brummet requested this property be rezoned to C4, MPC staff recommended C6, and MPC itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:33| voted for a C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| The problem with this zoning is that it does not allow for Ms. Brummet to display any furniture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| outside of the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| She would like to be able to display during the day, time only, three or four pieces of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| furniture, three or four antiques to draw people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| Previously a C6 was denied, but it was denied because it went through the process, it came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| before this body sometime late last year and it was denied because Ms. Brummet was ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| in the hospital and couldn't attend the meeting and nobody was here to speak on its behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| and no motion was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| If you all, I think most of you are probably familiar with this neighborhood, across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| street from this is a FedEx terminal which is zoned I3, East Tennessee Natural Gas which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| is zoned I3, a brick company which is zoned I3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| It's probably two lots west of Pepsi Cola distributing company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| Across the street from Pepsi Cola I believe is the state garage, city garage maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| And it's behind, there's a state testing lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| We would, if the neighborhood had any objections to any other type of noxious activity there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| we'd be willing to submit or agree to conditions to allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| The only thing that she wants and the reason she needs a zoning more intense than C3 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| C3 will not permit her to display any of her antiques outside during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| If anybody has any questions, I have Ms. Brummet here, she can answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| I have the person who owns the property beside it and directly back of it, they are all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| favor of this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Yes, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| You asked the people who were supporting Ms. Brummet to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:44| Would all of you stand up again please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| All of you who live in that neighborhood remain standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| If you don't live in that neighborhood, would you please be seated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| If you do not live in the Westview community, and I know the tailors who are still standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| you own the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| This gentleman here owns the houses behind it, Jack Wiesner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| Mr. Jalobowy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| Mr. Valiant, before you leave, you looked like you were about to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| As I understood this MPC record as I was reading through it, it looked like C3 was the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| There was some opposition to the C4, the outdoor display caused sort of a lot of concern because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| they weren't sure what would happen after this particular business was gone sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| And then there was a debate about the C6 and the C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| It seemed like the neighborhood was saying they could accept and live with the C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| Is that your understanding of what happened there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Well, the neighborhood agreed that they could live with C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| The problem is that C3, I don't think, would allow this business to remain in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| She has to have some sort of an outside presence during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| I think they got upset when she first moved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| I think the lady from Codes, I saw her here a minute ago, when she first moved in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| she had placed some furniture under some blue tarps, which was unsightly, and it was more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| or less when she was first moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| As soon as she found out that that was not what she should be doing, I think she went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| to Codes, found out what she needed to be doing, and has complied with everything since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| C3 is what, I think there was two ladies at the NPC meeting that were objecting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| this particular zoning, but the zoning will not allow her to stay in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| We're asking for something a little more intense, C4, C6, something that will allow her to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:59| permit her to have outside displays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| The C4, of course, opens up everything, including stuff in the parking lot, like car sales and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| They said this site was very small, probably not capable of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| The C6 allowed some of those outdoor uses with review by NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| Maybe I could ask Mr. Donaldson, what did the staff come up with in terms of C6 versus C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| C6 does allow some outdoor display of merchandise that's available within the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:33| It allows that in the side and rear yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| And because...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Side and rear, but not front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| And it does provide for staff review of site plans for any work requiring a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:49| So if the property were to be redeveloped, it would require site plan review by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:58| So how did you end up with this particular parcel in terms of the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| Well, we're aware that outdoor display is an important part of the antique business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| and wanted to be able to allow that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| C3 prohibits outdoor display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| C4 has a whole bunch of uses that people might consider undesirable associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| So C6 is kind of the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| Okay, but the full commission voted for C3, is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| And do you have the ability to put any conditions on what can be displayed outdoors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| In other words, if you had C6, could you limit what was there or C6 opens it up to anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| that fits in the general category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| We believe that the council can place conditions on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Okay, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Perhaps this is for Ms. Fromit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Ms. Fromit, you're in the antique business, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| She's in the police business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| My name's Ann Brummett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| I live at 5428 Smoky Trail off Lonest Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| Okay, and could you define for me what you consider antiques in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| Well, sometimes I know I like for them to be either 50 or 75 years old, but if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:24| buying an estate sale out, you get a lot of things that's not antiques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| But I can assure the council, and I wouldn't mind if you put a stipulation in it, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| I could have a few things outside during the day and they're to be put up inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| And also that it can't ever be a car lot, because I don't know where that came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| but I've never ever considered a car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| Okay, well, back to, when you go to estate sales then, does that explain where the princess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| bicycles that were out there last week came from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Yes, yes it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Or the bicycles that were there last December, that were just part of an estate sale you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| picked up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Well, yes, I have, you know, I've got the city, well, anyway, yes, it probably does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| but I gave so much of it to the angelic ministries, I'm having it all the time, and I'm having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| to give it to either harm or angelic ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| Well, certainly that's a commendable, both of those groups are very worthy causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| The concern that we have here with this piece of property is that outside displays are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| consistent with the other zoning in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| And so I think that perhaps one of the problems is the kinds of things that we have consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| seen displayed on the Fridays and Saturdays that you're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| But not much of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| Look, I've got an old churn that was sitting right there, I had this little kid's bicycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| and the first one that comes by from Big Oak Apartments, we give them all kinds of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| from down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| But you're asking for outside display?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| Yes, some outside, but I will not have a junky place, I will not have a tarps out, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| certainly will not ever have a car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| I'm just asking to be able to permit to sit a very few things outside, and you watch it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| all the time, I'm sure you see it all the time, and you will know, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Well, I'd like to say that Miss Palmer told me if I would build an awning on the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:41| I mean, I had a big sign, I'll hurry, I had a big sign up, and everything she's asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| me to do, I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| I paid to get the big disc taken down, and she told me if I could build an awning, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| could have some stuff under the awning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| Well, when I went up to codes to find out how they wanted me to build it and what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| can do, Anita Cash, Miss Cash, told me that I couldn't have any outside sales on three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:11| And I was under the impression from Miss Palmer that I could do that, and find out that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Mayor, may I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Okay, I did have a conversation with Miss Brummett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| We were trying to look at some possibilities to help her stay in business and also not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| prevent that, or to prevent that property from becoming, having the appearance perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| of a flea market, which is a neighborhood fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| So I believe we did, I did say we needed to look into the possibility of an awning attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| to the building might be able to allow a couple of pieces outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| I didn't say that we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| I said we'd have to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| And as you found out, and I found out, that is not something that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| Okay, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| We have some more speakers signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| We have two other folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| I'll just wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Would everybody like to wait to hear the other speakers that signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| Everybody has lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| We have two other speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| I don't, you didn't check if you were here for or against, so I'm just going to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| them in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Susan Hardin would be first, and then Jason Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| Susan, if you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Susan Hardin, H-A-R-D-I-N, 2806 Denson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| I did submit an email to MPC when this was in their court, and it is in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| and I will try to just summarize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| We do prefer as a community that it remain R2, but we're, in the spirit of compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| going to accept C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Our big concern is outdoor display and it becoming a flea market atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| There are some R2 properties immediately behind, a church to the east, a cemetery to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3469)|
| 0:57:59| around that shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| I suspect the property is perhaps too small for outside display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| There is very, it is a small parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| There is limited parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| I and the community have the concern that perhaps if there is not adequate parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| that it will drive them onto the dead end of Keith where it runs out into Millbrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| and therefore irritate the residents that live immediately behind the shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:34| If, I feel like if the outdoor display was a necessity to stay in business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| that it would have been a smarter move to have gone to a commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| rather than trying to take an R2 zoning and turn it into a C3, 4, 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3525)|
| 0:58:54| whatever it might be, after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| The city has found in some other areas of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| that the flea market atmosphere has been difficult to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| and I hope it will be done right the first time rather than trying to fix it at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:13| I do not understand the antiques business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| I have done some retail in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| I am not sure why any antique dealer wants their product outside at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:30| There are also some properties further west from the location that are C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| and this C3 would fall in line with those properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| I believe that is all I have. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| Thank you. Jason Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| Mr. Bird, if you would give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Jason Bird, 1515 Fay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| Mr. Mayor and City Council, we have been in the Westview community for over 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:05| I am the president of Westview Community Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| We have been in operation for 21 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| and we have been trying to lift Westview out of the slums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| and we think this little antique shop is an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| I know when we pass by there, it does not look very good for visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| I have a lot of people out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| They come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| I tell them how to get to our house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| and they always have a comment, a bad comment about who lives there, what goes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| And we have run out, since we have been in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| we have run out drug dealers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| We had one person that set up a taxicab station on Fay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| She runs taxicabs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Then we had a furniture store, antique furniture store, open up on Fay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| Parked their truck there, Taylor Furniture Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| And we just want to lift the Westview community up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| to where it would be like the rest of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| We feel like stepchildren to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| because other community groups, they get all kinds of attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| We do not get no attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| It seems like everything that comes in lands in Westview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| And I wish we could get this thing solved tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| where this antique shop could move somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| because we have had a sports bar right behind my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| and some time ago they got burned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| I do not know who burned them out, but they were drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Anyway, now we have got a cigarette store selling beer behind my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| We just do not like stuff like that to go on in a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| And I think that you all could understand and recognize our viewpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| because, you know, as a Christian, I think we ought to live above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| some standards that some people think about as good standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| And that is exactly what I preach about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| So you all think about it tonight and see what you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| come up with our viewpoint and see if I am right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| I do not think any of you would want to live in Westview community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| I do not believe any of you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| But we have lived there over 50 years, raised a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Our boys and girls went to Westview School, Root High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| and everyone prospers because we really took care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| We try to take care of other people in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| but we do not think this antique shop is a place where it ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Mr. Valiant or Ms. Brummett, one of you can have two minutes to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| I have a picture of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| I am sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| I meant to turn this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| I have a picture of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| Mr. Valiant or whoever can pass it up to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| I have some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| I am here from the Westview Church that has gone there all their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| And I canvassed the, well, I am a trustee there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| but we canvassed the church and they signed a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| They had no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| I talked to a Joyce Avenue minister just this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| And that is on Joyce Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| It is Westview Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| And they told me they had no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Daniel, the preacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| This will be part of the two minutes that you have to reply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| so if you could keep this very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| I am Charles Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| I live at 3901 Wincrest Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| I wanted to make a comment about the R2 commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Since that property has been annexed into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| however many years ago that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| that particular building property was grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| Whenever we got the comment from codes about R2, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:20| we have been paying commercial taxes on that since we inherited the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| And I have got the tax records that just came the other day that still remains commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| Our first attempt at getting it zoned C6 was to address that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| Since apparently nobody remembers it being grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| or the people that we talked to back in early 98,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| whoever preceded MPC assured us that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| So that was the only comment I wanted to make about the reason we are asking for a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| And C6 was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Well, it was on the consent list at the first MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| and was approved at the second MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| which we didn't know the council was hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| And Ms. Brummett missed it because she was in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Okay. Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Now back to comments from council. Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| I guess this question is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| And I want to make sure that we are clear in terms of what we are considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| There has been some discussion that although C3 was what was approved by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| that C4 might be something that Ms. Brummett is asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| because of the outdoor display of merchandise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| But I asked Ms. Mitchell to copy for council both the regulations for C3 and C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| so we could have it in front of us because sometimes it's a little bit complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| And if you look at page 3 or 4 of this handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| and you look at number 21 on page 3 or 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| it addresses open storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| And my question, Mr. Donaldson, is to make sure that I understand this code correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| It says, all open storage and display of merchandise, material, and equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| shall be screened by adequate ornamental fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| or evergreen planting at the side and rear, etc., etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| So to me, that sounds like if you're screening it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| that that would displace Ms. Brummett's desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| for her merchandise to be visible to potential buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| Is the screening that's required by this code such that you can't see the merchandise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=3992)|
| 1:06:40| Under the C4, item number 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| it does require screening by ornamental fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| or planting at the side and rear of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| so you can keep the front of the lot open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| Okay, that was confusing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| So someone who had the C4 zone could have merchandise displayed outdoors in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:07| But if they had merchandise at the side or the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| it would have to have this screening that's addressed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| I interpret that to say that the screening has to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| at the side or the rear lot property lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| rather than on the front property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Okay, sorry to keep asking the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| So you interpret C4 as allowing outdoor display of merchandise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| in the front yard only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| In any yard, but then it provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| that screening has to be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| along the side and rear property lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| so you can keep the front property line open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| Okay, let me ask this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| So if you had C4 and you wanted outdoor display of merchandise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| your interpretation is that you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| because of that use in the front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| you would have to plant some kind of hedge or fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| along all of your side and rear yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Correct, either ornamental fencing or planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| Which is not currently present on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| Ms. Cash, I have a question for Ms. Cash who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| Could you give us an example of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| that might utilize this kind of use in a C4 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| when you go out and look at them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| How long do you want the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Just a handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| I think one of the concerns is no matter what zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| council comes up with tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| whether it's the C3 or the 4 or the 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| that we understand that Ms. Brummett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| will probably not be the last person to have use of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| and what kinds of other uses might that zone allow going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| Assuming she's rezoned to C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| If she's rezoned to C4, which allows some outdoor display,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| what other types of outdoor display| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| might neighbors see in a C4 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| Car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| New and used car, truck and sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| a garden center, a greenhouse, a nursery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| a fruit or vegetable stand, a souvenir shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| drive-in commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| motorcycle sales or repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| And all that is allowed as long as you screen the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| and the rear yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| I'm confused about this screening part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| According to the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| the chief building official, who at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| is Gary Norman, is in charge of interpreting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| and enforcing this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| And it has been our interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| both in the past and since Mr. Norman has been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| is that the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| is a violation of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| And the zoning ordinance is a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| is that if you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| in a C4 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| and you abut a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| you are required to screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| the sides and the rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| if that is where your display is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| If your display is in the side and the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| But if you don't display in the side and the rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| where your street is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| and you're not encroaching upon the residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| then you're not required to screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| And a perfect example of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| that we just had that many of you have called us about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| was the lot at the corner of Broadway and Granger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| where it did abut residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| both on the Granger Avenue side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| and on the rear back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you. With counsel's indulgence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| I have one more question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| And that is back to the C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| that MPC staff looked at originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| Talk to us again about the kinds of restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| that are on C6 in terms of site plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| I'm looking at addressing the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| not only of this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| but some of the allowable businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| 10, 15 years in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| 20 years in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| When does that site plan approval come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| and how does that work if it's C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| Prior to any building permit being issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| the applicant has to submit a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| to MPC staff for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| and we review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| with regard to conforming with the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| of the C6 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| So we look at the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| and setbacks would be the primary issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Any landscaping that is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| There are some provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| on parking lot access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| and that sort of thing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Those are the types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| that we would look at during the site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| I don't have C6 in front of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| but my recollection is it does allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| outdoor display of a wide range of merchandise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| including used cars and that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| under its basic standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| It's got kind of a quirky bit of language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| It says that all outdoor storage facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| are prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| and then it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| it does not include the outdoor display| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| of new or used automotive vehicles for sale or rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| or the incidental display of goods or chattels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| for sale or rent in a commercial planned unit development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| by an establishment having activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| that occur principally within a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| And then it further says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| if outdoor display is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| it cannot be within the required front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| In the required front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| which is a bit of a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| That would be the first 25 feet away from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| So in C6 if I display my merchandise outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| it has to be 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| out away from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| Closer to the street in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| No, it can be no closer than 25 feet from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| From the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| If a conditional zoning were considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| you could look at something like C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| and restrict the types of outdoor displays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| that were possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| You could restrict the types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| You could limit them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| display during the hours that the operation is open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| Okay, that's all for me right now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| I'll go to Councilman Grieve and I'll come back to this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| I just wanted to go back to, Anita, what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| The piece of property on Broadway was zoned what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4470)|

| 1:14:36| Yes, sir. It was zoned C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| That's the one that a number of us have gotten complaints about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| because of the change of ownership and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| It's difficult to control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| It's no longer in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| Right, but it could go back to what it was last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| which is open sale of furniture and that sort of thing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| Under certain conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| they were operating outside the scope of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| and we actually issued them notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101005part1?start=4507)|
