| 0:01:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| Do we have a motion to approve the minutes from the prior meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| One of the responsibilities given to us by our charter is to select a chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=101)|
| 0:01:47| and I believe vice chairman at the first audit committee meeting of each calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| I've served as chairman for I guess going on about the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| and I'd like to propose that we elect a new chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| and specifically I'd like to propose that Jim Morrison be voted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| This only works if what you've just heard motioned passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| And you agree to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| Any discussion on the matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Want to make a pitch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Well, I had assumed you would be doing another year, but I'll be glad to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| I'm going to do another year on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| No longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Maybe, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| I have some other responsibilities with my other job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| and some personal commitments as well, and I'd feel better about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=171)|
| 0:02:59| if somebody maybe with a little bit less outside distraction this year were the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=179)|
| 0:03:10| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Sorry, I'm leaning in against my butt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| I thought you had a late comment there, late thought, so okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Anything else, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| I don't know if it's effective immediate or the next meeting or how that part works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| I think the way it's written it would be effective this meeting and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| If you already have notes in that, it's up to you and Jim whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| or not you want to talk about the CAFR directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| I'll let you keep going this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| So last couple meetings we've had discussions related to the mandatory audit firm rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=232)|
| 0:04:04| We've had a go-do for Mr. Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| He was going to take a shot at revising the language in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| Is it in the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Is that the right term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| It's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| In the charter related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| If everybody will recall, the current language, to kind of summarize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| essentially says that after two four-year terms we will rebid and get a new external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=270)|
| 0:04:41| I have proposed in the past that I don't think it's a good practice to have a mandatory requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=281)|
| 0:04:50| I think it's better to have the option to change auditors if we see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=290)|
| 0:04:59| So Mr. Book has provided this revised language and I'll read it aloud to everybody and for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=299)|
| 0:05:08| So the highlighted changes reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| an individual certified public accountant or firm of certified public accountants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| shall be employed to perform the independent audits of Knox County as required under law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| Upon employment by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| the independent auditor shall serve at the pleasure of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| upon the recommendation of the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| The replacement of any hiring of an outside auditing firm shall require an outside auditing firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| to submit a request for qualifications to the Audit Committee for review and recommendation to the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=338)|
| 0:05:50| I'll turn to you for guidance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| The way this would work is I have drafted and I think everybody has a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| I handed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| I've got one more up here if you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| I've done a series of whereas clauses to why to explain what I understood from this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| was a reason to modify this and make it at the discretion of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| rather than a mandatory four years and then another four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| Amongst those things as discussed by Dave Shields and his committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| were the expense of every eight years having to get a new firm in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| and just to figure out what's going on and get your feet wet was going to be a big expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| And if the commission is satisfied with, in this case, it's Pew and Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=398)|
| 0:06:46| they can continue on with the employment of Pew and Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| And I have the whereas's stated up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| What happens is whatever this board audit committee decides, you may want to change the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| There's no pride of authorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| You may want to change it, add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Whatever this committee suggests and agrees to will then be sent on to county commission, full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| Full commission then will review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| And if full commission is in agreement, then based on their vote of two-thirds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| it will be submitted to the voters in the, as of now, we're looking at the August election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| because it's a charter provision, therefore only the voters can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| So that's the procedure we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=454)|
| 0:07:46| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| One thing I noticed that's not in the language and that may be making it overly complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| especially for a charter amendment, I know we've been discussing in this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| that the right way to do this would probably be through mandatory partner rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| That's not in this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| So how would that become part of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| If this passes commission and appears on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| and we want to kind of mandate some partner rotation, how would that look in terms of moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| So unless I'm mistaken, at the end of each year, we have the option to renew the auditor's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=500)|
| 0:08:29| Regardless of what year we are in the four-year term, I think all we have to do is say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=509)|
| 0:08:37| hey, we want you to put a new partner on the engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| And they would have two options, put a new partner on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| or not have their contract renewed at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| Is that something that could be done when we have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| Every year, did we sign a new contract after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| I wonder if that's something that could be in the contract language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| I assume that there's a contract extension signed at the end of each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| Is that right, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| We always do a renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| We have a form through procurement as a renew or not to renew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| and the department had either renews or not renews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| Not sure if that actually answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| When you have that renewal at the end of the first four years, can it roll over like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| Do you have to re-bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Currently, after the end of the fourth year, we have to go back out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| And so what Jay, I think Jay is back there, what Jay would do is put that back out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| Currently, the current firm could continue to bid for that year, for the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=580)|
| 0:09:47| But then after year eight, then they cannot bid again, but everybody else can continue to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| So what we're looking at here is we're not changing that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| I guess you could with the next contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| but you could have one after the second four years and they re-bid again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Before that, they couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| I think how David Schilder is proposing it and how it's written up by Mr. Buch is that we would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=608)|
| 0:10:18| let's say the next term when their contract's up after year eight, we would go out to bid if this were to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=618)|
| 0:10:25| And then we have unlimited amounts of renewals until there comes a point to where we would want to put it back out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=625)|
| 0:10:35| There's not how he's doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| There's never, after four years, you don't have to re-bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| It's just continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| You can do a renewal or not, a renewal or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| And then when you get to the point to where you don't want to re-bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| then when you want to change auditors, then you just put that back out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| I believe that's how it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| That's the way I interpret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| I've never seen a situation where you have no intention of changing auditor and you still put it out for a re-bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=660)|
| 0:11:11| I don't think that's a good practice or fair to firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| Just as a technical thing, it's actually what's called an RFQ, request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| Under state law, you don't put out bids as far as number bids like you would for construction contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=683)|
| 0:11:32| because they're professionals and as professionals it's an RFQ, request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| And that's just a technical thing, but that's in here that that would go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| if the committee and the commission wanted a new replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=702)|
| 0:11:53| So it will be somewhat evergreen until we decide it's decided that we want to re-bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| It's not that we're going to automatically, just to clarify, ask for it to be re-bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| This is, it says we have underemployment by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| shall serve at the pleasure of Knox County Commission upon recommendation of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| So if you're continuing to serve at the pleasure of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| and if we decide that it's time for a change, then would we be the ones that would put that in motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| Otherwise, it will continue to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| Speaking in non-legal kind of everyday guy terms, does that mean basically we're good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| if this passes, we're going to be good, you can keep doing business like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| but in the event that we determine that it's time for a change, we can make that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Without the necessity to do this re-bid process or the new RFQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| that will only be, that trigger will only be pulled upon the direction of this committee to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| And I think that puts us in line with what I would determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| or what I would coin kind of industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| But the RFQ is competitively bid, even though it's not a sealed bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| It's not a, it's a strange animal with professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| You just put a what are your qualifications, and that's what goes before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| You don't go into I'm charging this much per hour or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| although that may be something for this committee to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| But the RFQ is just a request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| And if, going back to Commissioner Nystrom's point about rotating partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| if this committee wants to suggest that there be a rotating partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=839)|
| 0:14:07| this committee can recommend that to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| So you're not dead on that issue, if that's what you mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| Just a further clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| If this passes out of our committee, and if this passes through county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| what exactly would appear on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| Would it be this updated 2-02 in its entirety, the change, the part that's highlighted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| And, by the way, I'd like to recognize Commissioner Gill, who is sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| who has joined us for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| But, yeah, if we could clarify, David, kind of exactly what would it look like on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| On the ballot, here's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Under the charter, the actual, this is what is going to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| However, the law director is charged with summarizing on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| so that the electors don't have to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| So it would say something like, do you want to amend Section 2.02 charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=903)|
| 0:15:12| to delete the requirement that accountants have to be, I'm just rambling off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=912)|
| 0:15:21| every eight years, or to allow them to serve as long as they're in good standing with the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| And you get it down to very small and very succinct so that the voters know what they're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| without having to read all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| So, if they want to agree with this, they could get to vote yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| rather than one of these weird ones where you have to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| We're going to put signs out all over town that says vote yes on number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=946)|
| 0:15:55| Do we want to consider the language on partner rotation with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| Or is that something we want to do on our own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| And I don't know how that's normally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| Larry Elmore might know how that's traditionally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| Or not Larry Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| My name is Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| I'm the Director of Procurement for Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| I wanted to just kind of clarify the RFQ process in that when that document goes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| it's really focusing on the qualifications of the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Any pricing aspect would come at the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| So I just wanted to be sure that everybody knew that we're looking for qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| and it's all qualification-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| We negotiate price when we have the most qualified firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| Mr. Chairman, if I might add in to what Matt has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| I recently had the pleasure of working with Matt and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| when we had a very similar RFQ for a very technical skill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| when we sought an experienced investment advisor for the pension committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| And I would guess it would be a fairly similar process to something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| It was your pleasure with all 18 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| I literally had to deliver two shopping carts' worth of documents to my car to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| So, yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| I have one more question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| On the last go-around when we did, I guess I'll call it an RFQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| or the last time it was open and that Pew took over the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| did that go to more than one firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Did you give that to several firms or did you allow firms to request to submit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| Obviously awarded to one firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Now, we have a database based on NIGP commodity codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| so it could have gone to 50, 100, 150 different firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| That's really what I was wondering about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| I can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| There were several firms involved in the bid process last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| And I can also tell you that it was just like you said, request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| We got a call that said we have selected you based on your qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| now come to our office and we're going to talk about price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| They put me in a room with this big light right in my face and we talked about price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| I can assure you it doesn't take much to intimidate Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| That's better than the three bullets I still have in my desk drawer from many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| I think it would be good if the committee does go forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| that we do clarify whether in two more years when our current four-year term is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| do we go back out to bid at that point or do we just renew what we've already got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| and how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| I think if you all go forward with changing this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| we would probably want clarity for Pew CPAs to know what it is that we would have them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| at the end of this second four-year term for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| You know, my feeling on this is if at the end of this next four-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| we are satisfied with the service we're getting from Pew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| and we have no complaints, have no reason to want to have an audit or change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| I don't see why we go back out to bid or do anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| That's the way I tried to word it because it says a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| So at the end of the two-year or this four-year cycle, if you're going to replace, it goes out for RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| If not, continue to serve at the pleasure of commission and this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| Commissioner Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| So what's being said is the end of eight years would look exactly like the end of four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| The end of eight years would look like the end of years five, six, and seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| But there is something different right now at the end of four years currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| Actually, there is something different currently at the end of four and eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| So at the end of year four, we have to put it back out to RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| At the end of year eight currently, it goes back out to RFQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| and the only change is the current firm cannot bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| That's the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Right, and so that's the way it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| So I think that, now this is just my opinion, the end of year eight should look like the end of year four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| So you would want it to go back out to RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Because if we don't, at the end of year eight, it would be an easier path to contract than it is at year four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1239)|
| 0:20:49| I think the easier, and I don't have a dog and a five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| I think the easier path to contract would be what Shields is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| because he's just saying treat year eight as you would treat year seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| If you want to renew it, you just renew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| And so the same contract would stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Okay, so that's what I'm trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| I would be of the opinion that every four years should look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| Why would we be more restrictive in contracting requirements at the end of year four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| than we are at the end of year eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| I think, I may be confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| I think the way he's thinking is with this change, year eight looks no different than year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| Year ten would look no different than year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| It's all going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Right, but year four looks different though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| Currently, but not with his new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| But is it, excuse me, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| So what we're then implementing is a change to year four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| We're implementing a total change, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| There will be no more fours, no more eights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Okay, now then I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| If we're going to change year four, then that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| If we're going to sort of validate the contract year to year, then that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| That's correct, David, that's exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| I agree, and I just have one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| That may be more of a, we're putting in the procedural change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| If they have to change the contract document itself to allow for it to move forward like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| then that would follow on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| And have to be approved by this body and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| All the lights are out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| We have a motion to recommend to commission the changes outlined in section 2.02| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1377)|
| 0:23:07| related to audit firm tenure for selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1387)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Do you do discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| When do you do discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| I felt like we discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| I just didn't know if we decided on the rotation language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Did we decide that doesn't go in here, partner rotation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| My take is, at least just to get this initially passed to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| I don't think we need to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| As a matter of operating and in the actual language of any contract or expectation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| we may then want to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| That may actually, with what we pass in commission, that should, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| for the benefit of the public, know that we're just not giving them a pass to keep doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| I think that should be part of our discussion with county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| We'll say at full commission, we're going to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| and the audit committee will be tasked with ensuring that there is partner rotation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| which at maybe not the last audit meeting, but I know at a couple of meetings before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| we've talked extensively about getting the same business outcomes through partner rotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| as we would have with firm rotation, but we don't do it with the one-year expense of startup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| That needs to be maybe part of, I mean, back to what Jim has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| somehow that may be part of what we discuss for when we actually pass this to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| And I'll give you my opinion on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| So the charter puts a responsibility on us as audit committee to evaluate the external audit firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| We're supposed to consider their independence, objectivity, their qualifications, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| So with that in mind, if at any point in time we had a concern about independence, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| we could always say, hey, I think maybe the partner is getting too close to the county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| We want to have a partner rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| So my whole point for bringing that little scenario up is it's inherently implied in here that we will govern over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1520)|
| 0:25:30| That's part of the responsibility of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| It's not explicitly stated because the county is not a public company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| and there's not a standard as there would be for a publicly traded company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| where there is a required partner rotation that's required by the Securities Exchange Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| And the other thing, too, we always hold the trump card here because at the end of every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1550)|
| 0:26:00| if we were to get any kind of pushback from the auditor on rotating the partner, the contract would just end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| We wouldn't renew it, put it back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| So I feel like whether it's explicitly stated in writing doesn't really matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1572)|
| 0:26:21| because we're still in total control of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| But I agree with you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| When you go to full commission, I would convey that they can have the expectation that we will enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1586)|
| 0:26:36| and require a four-year partner rotation as if this were a public company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| Especially if that's best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| In the private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| A five-year rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Yeah, a five-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| We'd also probably, not knowing exactly which commission meeting that this will be on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| but obviously, David and Jim, we'd expect you all to be at county commission as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| to kind of be part of this discussion at that particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| So I'm sure that will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| So if you've got a Monday night, and it may be something that we could actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| it's a little bit less bandwidth that we could dedicate some discussion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| And I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of some of the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| who might want to ask questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| This could be something that could be covered in a work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| and discussed, vetted for the public, and then could end up on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| But no guarantees on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| But either way, I'm just trying to anticipate that this could be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| that some of the other commissioners might have questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And if we could get their understanding, perhaps, at a county work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| that might help, and that would be the most transparent thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| especially something that's going to end up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| we've got a pass that's going to be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| That's something that's going to want some good sunshine on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| I agree that I just didn't understand for sure if we had decided to not make that part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| and I'm fine with the way we're doing it, so I apologize for ambushing your eyes going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1687)|
| 0:28:16| Procedural perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Motion again, or where are we at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Sorry, that was a discussion after a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Discussion's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| So all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| I can add that since this has not been changed much and it's in the form of a proposed resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| we can get it to Drew for whatever meeting she wants it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| or you commissioners want to have it on next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| If the law department could prepare a resolution, the fellow commissioner and I will co-sponsor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| I'll have it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| And the time frame we're looking at is if we're going to get this on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| assuming the commission will pass it to go to the voters, if the election's in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| when is it in August, do you know, the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| It's early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Early August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| And the election commission has to have it 90 days prior to the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| August 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| So 90 days prior to that is when it would have to be to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1763)|
| 0:29:34| I would suggest we don't drag our feet because it's taken a pretty good while to get it to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| I can have it on the next commission agenda and then the commission can hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Next on the agenda is the external audit update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| So Larry or Ted, whoever wants to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1792)|
| 0:30:11| I think better on my feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| We have a lot of information to cover, and as you can see, the size of the CAFR is about 300 pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| so it certainly won't cover all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| My name is Larry Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I'm the audit partner in charge of the audit of Knox County and have been so for, I guess, we did the first four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1827)|
| 0:30:36| We did another four, and I'm on the second year of that four-year term, so six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1836)|
| 0:30:45| And so what we have to cover today is the CAFR itself, which you received in an e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| and then you have two reports from us, one being what we call our audit committee letter, audit committee report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| and then the single audit report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| And what I'd like to do is cover very briefly, unless, were you going to cover the CAFR or do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1862)|
| 0:31:12| Let me take the CAFR itself, which came to you on your laptops or iPads, whatever you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| and just tell you that if I were in your shoes, what pages I would look at and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| So if you open it up, and just to walk you through, in the early pages, which doesn't have a page number on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1886)|
| 0:31:35| there's a transmittal letter from the mayor, which basically tells the history of the year, the history of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| and what happened, things that he would like to highlight over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Some of it relates to the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Some of it relates to his term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| And then at the end of that letter, on page 10 of that letter, it's Roman numerals up in the very top corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1913)|
| 0:32:02| There's a page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| It talks about the fact that this is the 21st year that the county has received the GFOA excellence in reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1925)|
| 0:32:14| financial reporting for its annual CAFR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| I would tell you that that's not an easy task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| It's a very difficult task because you send your CAFR in to a team of accountants and auditors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| and professionals who dissect it and look at what's in it, how easy is it to read and understand and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1946)|
| 0:32:34| So the county has received that for 21 consecutive years, which is something to be very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1954)|
| 0:32:45| Then if you continue on to page Roman numeral 18 is the beginning of what's called the management discussion and analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1965)|
| 0:32:54| This section is kind of a discussion of what happened in the county in layman's terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| So, in other words, instead of looking at a set of financial statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| and talking about the numbers themselves in particular, you can read through this MD&A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| and it's just like the MD&A of a public company where it walks you through what happened during the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| the highlights, the things that are important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| And then behind that, it goes over to page 25 in Roman numerals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2002)|
| 0:33:31| And on that particular page, there's some economic factors, next year's budget and those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| kind of a forward-looking page on what's going to happen down the road within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2016)|
| 0:33:44| And then on page, I have to look close because these numbers are so small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| but on page one, which is the statement of net position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| what you have in any governmental-type report is, for lack of a better term, you have two sets of financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2035)|
| 0:34:04| You have one set that's prepared under what's called government-wide presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| which presents more on an accrual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| All your assets are recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Your capital assets that you buy actually get capitalized, put on the books, and depreciated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| as opposed to the second version of the methods would be where you would expense those as you buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| Even if they're $250,000, $500,000, you expense them as you buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| But on this first presentation, you capitalize your assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| You record accruals for receivables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| You record receivables for payables, liabilities for payables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| And most significantly, you record debt on this type of presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| And on the second version, which don't ask me why the governmental gurus in the ivory towers want you to have two sets, but they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2090)|
| 0:35:01| In the second version, that debt is expensed as it's paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| So debt payments, as opposed to reducing debt, just go to expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| So you'll see if you go to page four, there's a reconciliation of the two types of presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2112)|
| 0:35:23| And thank goodness they do require this, because you can see what happens between the two methods of presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| So it's called reconciliation of the balance sheet of governmental funds to the statement of net position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| So you see the $115 million is the ending fund balance under governmental funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| which fund balance would translate to net worth in the corporate world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| And so that's $115 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| And so you see to convert down to the $39 million in deficit under the other method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| you have to add capital assets, which get expensed under the second method, and you have to deduct debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| Those are the two primary adds and deducts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| So this page walks you through that reconciliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Now, by the same token, on page six, page six walks you through the two versions of, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2169)|
| 0:36:18| the income statement, what you're used to hearing it called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| But in the governmental world, one of them is called the net change in fund balance, which is the government-wide version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| And the one on the bottom is called change in net position of governmental activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| So in this presentation, you see that the main differences between the two are under 43,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2192)|
| 0:36:43| almost $44 million reconciliation where debt proceeds are treated differently, as I discussed a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| And then debt payments also are treated differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| So those two pages are the two that reconcile the two versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2214)|
| 0:37:02| Going on to page 13, and I'm going to start moving pretty quickly here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| Even though I'm on 13, I'm going to move quick here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| 13 starts the summary of significant accounting policies and the footnotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| So the footnotes are just like you would expect a footnote to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| It explains the numbers in the front, gives further detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| and talks about how to understand how the county operates, how the county relates to other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| who are our related parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| And you'll note in this CAFR that it's a little unusual in that the component unit that we have, the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2252)|
| 0:37:43| is actually larger than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| So the county, a component unit in the world of governmental means that you have control over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| or you have some significant relationship either by virtue of appointing their board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| determining their budget, or having a very strong responsibility to maintain their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| That's what qualifies you as a component unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| So the Board of Education is a component unit of Knox County, which is larger than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2286)|
| 0:38:14| So there's some discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| Then on page 57, you can see a detail of all the various debt components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2297)|
| 0:38:26| Another difference between what you would expect to see and what you see with Knox County's CAFR is the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| the Board of Education, cannot incur debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| That's by charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| So when there is debt incurred, the bond proceeds and the bond debt is incurred by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2318)|
| 0:38:47| They receive the money and they pay the money over to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| So under fund accounting, which is the one where you expense everything instead of recording the normal capitalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2332)|
| 0:39:01| and accruals, when those proceeds are paid over to the Board of Education, it's counted as an expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| So that's another kind of unusual situation where the debt, and then so what happens is the debt winds up being on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2347)|
| 0:39:19| What's done with the debt and what's spent with the debt proceeds happens over on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| So it's kind of like a split between assets and liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| The county gets the liabilities, the schools get the assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| Okay, moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| 71 is a new pronouncement this year in the governmental world where you had to disclose tax abatements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2378)|
| 0:39:49| This was an attempt to disclose to the outside world just how much governmental entities were foregoing with tax abatements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2389)|
| 0:40:01| And so you can see in the case of Knox County, at the last paragraph on page 71,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2401)|
| 0:40:10| you see that during the fiscal year 2017, there were 42 pilot agreements in force with tax abatements totaling almost 2.3 million for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2410)|
| 0:40:21| And then on the next page you see tax increment financing, or TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| There were 30 of those in force with tax abatements totaling 1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| So the total of the two is about 4.1 million of tax abatements for 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| Hey, Larry, are you ñ is there any detail to those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| I think I've asked this question before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| We have detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| It's not in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| The requirement is that you can kind of segregate them into blocks of whatever size you want to for the disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| And that's done for purposes of different counties and different cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Different municipalities may have, you know, this many versus that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| And so for presentation here, on page 73, there are two that were over, I think, a half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2462)|
| 0:41:13| Is that the designation you picked there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Yeah, anything over a half a million, the county chose to detail it, and it's on page 73, the two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2475)|
| 0:41:25| But they have the analysis on all of them that's just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| Right, but it's not a requirement to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| It's not a requirement that you list all of them, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| And it's also not a requirement that you project future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| You know, like on debt where you have the next so many years of how much it's going to mature, you don't have to do that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| So this was the first year of this requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| I'm sure they'll start adding things as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2510)|
| 0:42:03| Okay, then I would suggest you go to page 88, some more accounting pronouncements that are coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| or were implemented this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| One of them is on page 89 is discussed as Gatsby Statement Number 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2531)|
| 0:42:19| This is accounting for post-employment benefits other than pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| And this will affect the county in the year ended 2018, and we do expect it to be a significant effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| because it is taking estimated calculations for the accrual of certain OPEB accruals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2552)|
| 0:42:42| and having them be actually actuarially computed in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| What's happening right now is there are numbers submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| Some of them come back from an actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| Some of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| There's some hand calculations that have to be done with these estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| Whereas in the future, 75 will require that total calculation to be done by an actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| And we have this one particular calculation that was done this year as one of the prior period adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| for the health care for retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| That will be actuarially computed in June of 18 or for the year of June of 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| and we expect that number to increase substantially based on what we know at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2605)|
| 0:43:35| And we'll talk some more about that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Page 90, speaking of restatements, there were two large restatements this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2619)|
| 0:43:48| Restated by what we mean by that is they applied to previous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| and we had to record adjustments to bring those current to the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| And these are discussed further in our audit committee letter here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2639)|
| 0:44:07| and I'd like to defer that to when we get in there because it's more clearly understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| But you can see here at the bottom of this page the effect that these adjustments had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| There was one adjustment that the county itself posted for half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| that was just a matter of where payments were being recorded in the wrong constitutional officer's account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| special revenue fund, as opposed to an agency fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| And so that was just a technicality, a fix to move it to the right spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| The other two related to sick leave and retiree health care were actually our two audit adjustments this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2677)|
| 0:44:47| Moving on to page 91, from 91 all the way to 152 is just talking about all the different retirement plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2687)|
| 0:45:02| and benefits that the county provides that have to be actuarially computed or calculated otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2702)|
| 0:45:10| And so you can see that there's a lot of them starting, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| note five is the whole note talking about all those, and it goes for about 50 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| So you can read those at your leisure and learn more about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| Starting on page 231 is the detailed statements for the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2726)|
| 0:45:38| This is in what's called the supplementary section of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| Discretely Presented Component Units, and Knox County Board is the first one shown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| The first two pages are the government-wide presentation, as I talked about, where you have accruals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| and then the pages following that are at the fund level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2756)|
| 0:46:07| And then here again, those statements have reconciliations with those that walk you from one version to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| For example, on page 236, you can see that reconciliation between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2774)|
| 0:46:23| Then there's a big section in the back called the statistical section, beginning on page 258,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| which shows you the last ten years of various numbers that are a bunch of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| There's numbers on the financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| There's numbers on tax rates, ten largest taxpayers in the county and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| And so there again is some interesting reading back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2802)|
| 0:46:51| So that's a ten- to fifteen-minute walkthrough of the things that I would look at if I were in your shoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| and didn't want to spend a whole afternoon on the CAFRA, but you want to spend some quality time with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2816)|
| 0:47:10| So let's now move to the two letters that we have that you should have separately, two letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| And we'll start with the smaller one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| It says, Report to the Mayor, County Commissioners, and Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| This letter is called the Audit Committee letter because a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| and those of you that have been on this committee for a while have heard me tell this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| but this letter came to being when Enron and WorldCom and all those audit failures occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| and the audit committees were not ever meeting with the auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| They just received the report in the mail or got it otherwise, and there was never any discussions between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| And so the accounting profession felt like that there were some very important things that should be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| with the audit committee and actually designated what's in this letter as being the bare minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| of what you should discuss with the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| So I'll walk you through these things that are required to be said and required to be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| The first one is our response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| This is on page one, and it's described as our responsibilities, and our, in this case, is Pew CPAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2895)|
| 0:48:25| We're required to audit your statements under general accepted auditing standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| and also under governmental auditing standards, which there are some differences, some pluses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| We did audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| We did not audit the financial statements of the Development Corp., the Great Schools Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| because those were audited by other firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| Development Corporation is a component unit of the county, and Great Schools is a component unit of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| We do receive their audit reports, and we incorporate information from those audits into our audit report, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| We're required to tell you about new pronouncements, new policies, new practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| The one major or significant difference in the two years is GASB 77, which is the tax abatement disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| and so that's shown there on page one at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| There were other pronouncements that came out this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| I think two others that related to either pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| I think they both related to pension plans, and those were disclosed in the footnote IVH,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| not nearly as significant as the tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| Those were clarifications of previous policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| On page two, we're required to tell you if there were any significant or unusual transactions that we were aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| There were none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| We didn't identify any significant or unusual transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| We are required to tell you about significant accounting estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| and so there is a discussion about that in the subsequent pages of this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| The audit adjustments proposed by us and recorded by management are shown in Exhibit B of this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3009)|
| 0:50:17| We're not aware of any uncorrected misstatements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Sometimes in doing an audit you become aware of things that are misstated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| things that could be adjusted to a closer number to be more accurate, but many times it's not material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3023)|
| 0:50:33| so you do what we call a past adjustment list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| and so we would be disclosing to you any adjustments that we had that we passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| and we had none this year that were material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| We're not aware of any uncorrected misstatements other than misstatements that are clearly trivial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| so we don't show you every little difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| We had no disagreements with management over the application of accounting principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| basis for judgments, or such things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| Significant issues discussed with management, we did have two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| and those discussions resulted in our two audit adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| You can see those disclosed on the bottom of page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| We discussed the county and the board's sick leave policies as they relate to ability of retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| at the time of their retirement to be paid for their unused sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| It is subject to certain limits, and we'll get into that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| This discussion resulted in two material property adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| The reason we say two there is one for the county and one for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| We also discussed the board's other post-employment benefit liability related to health care for retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| in the teacher's legacy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| So the discussions led to further discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| and those further discussions led to the property adjustments that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| On the next page, we didn't encounter any significant difficulties in dealing with management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| All the employees at the county, and particularly the county finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| who we deal with significantly, and also the board's finance department, who we deal with significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| always very cooperative, always very understanding of why we're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| always trying to help us do the best job that they can to provide us what we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| which is a significant amount of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| And we've never had any, I can say in the six years we've done the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| we have never had anyone who was not willing to provide us with what we needed to try to get the audit done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3157)|
| 0:52:45| and eventually provide us with what we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| We have issued a separate set of reports, which is your other document here that we'll get into in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| that talk about noncompliance issues or significant deficiencies or material weaknesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| and we'll talk about those briefly in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| One of the biggest issues in an audit that you as the audit committee should be concerned about is our independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| And so I'd like to disclose to you here in this independence section things that we have done for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| in this particular year that we have made sure that we didn't violate independence rules with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| but we want to make you aware of them so that if you want to ask any questions about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| First of all, we performed a separate audit of the Knox County Retirement and Pension Boarding System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| Ted Hotz, to my right here, is the partner in charge of that audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| And that is issued as a separate audit report on eight single employer pension trust funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3225)|
| 0:53:53| separate teams, separate auditors that do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| We were also engaged by, I guess the state engaged us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System hired us to perform some census data for the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| as required by the Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| and we presented those reports or the results of that report to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| and I think we have provided you copies of that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| Ted is going to go over those in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| They're, again, done by a separate audit partner, a separate team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3268)|
| 0:54:36| The third thing we did this year, which I think I, well, in fact, I know I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| I told the audit committee we were going to do this and kind of briefly told you it was going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| but the trustee's office hired us to come in and do some consulting with them on paper flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| how things flowed through their office, how they could get more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| It had nothing to do with internal controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| It had nothing to do with accounting or how they do their accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| It had simply to do with how to make things flow through the trustee's office more efficiently and more smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3299)|
| 0:55:07| We have issued that report in December, and that has been presented to the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3307)|
| 0:55:17| Ed's sitting around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| We'd be happy to provide copies of that if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| but Ed is at the present time going through it and deciding how he's going to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| or not implement some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| So in our opinion, none of those engagements impacted our independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3331)|
| 0:55:40| We followed all the necessary AICPA independence rules in doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| Hey, Larry, let me ask you real quick on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| I specifically remember once during the year you letting me know about some work you guys were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3350)|
| 0:55:58| You may have let me know about these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Going forward, any time you guys do anything outside the regular audit, be sure to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| Yeah, we've done this pension audit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| That was part of the original RFP, RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| So it was approved long ago for the same term that this one was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| So it's kind of a pre-approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| I mean, we'll be glad to tell you, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| But it's in our report every year that we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Larry, it seems to me I remember during the last year you brought up something that you'd been asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| I didn't know if it was this third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| It's the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Because I think you were going to get David to sign the letter after, because I remember I didn't quite understand it at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| It's the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Yeah, and I just tell you, you know, I appreciate you guys having your internal controls to make sure you are independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3403)|
| 0:56:54| but I want us to also be sure that we think you're independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| Just a friendly reminder, if you do anything outside the norm, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| And we always try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| If we failed in that, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| But we always normally put these things in our planning document that's very similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| You may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| I just don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Yeah, we'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| We haven't had those second two in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| This is the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| We've never done a consulting engagement before like the third one here at the county, and we've not done the census data in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| Three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Did we do it three years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| It's not an every year thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Is that the one that's required every three years or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Did I see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| But the first one was part of the original RFQ that we bid on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| It was actually a package of the audit and the pension plans together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| Starting on page four is the summary of significant accounting estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| In doing any audit, the numbers are never exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| There's always some numbers that are not precise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| and these are the things that in looking at the financials of the county are areas that involve estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| and they are significant estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| And so we're required to disclose to you what these items are, how management estimates them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| and then how we audit those estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| So if there's any of those you'd like to talk about, if not, I'll continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3512)|
| 0:58:43| Page seven, this is the audit adjustments that we've referred to a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3523)|
| 0:58:51| The first one was you can see that we've broken them into two categories, Knox County or Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3531)|
| 0:59:02| And the one that says Knox County and the one that says Board of Education, the first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3542)|
| 0:59:10| are kind of the same thing, but just one of them relates to the county and one to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| This is where both entities have for several years had a policy that if you retire with unused sick leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3555)|
| 0:59:26| that you can be paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Now, you can only be paid for it when you retire or if you retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| And there's two different scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| One, you get $60 a day, and one, you get $100 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| And that's only if you give 100 days notice to get the $100 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| And both of them have differences on how they are calculated, what the limits are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| For the county, the limit is $10,000, that you can only build up to $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| For the board, you can build up to one year's pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| So if your pay is $100,000, you can build up unused sick leave up to $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| So all those things were taken into account in making these calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3608)|
| 1:00:16| But the schools and the county both have had these in place for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| We were not aware of these two plans or these two benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| And what happened was, just to kind of give you in a nutshell how we became more aware this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| was the county had an accrual on their books for this benefit of $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| And so I guess it was that amount for two, three, maybe four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3642)|
| 1:00:51| And then this year, the accrual went from $200,000 to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| And so being auditors, we say, you know, why did this number go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| And can we get a detail on what caused the increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| Because it had been staying the same, and we were told it was an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| And, you know, in doing an audit, you pick various criteria to look further into things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| So, for example, materiality plays into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| The risk assessment that we do plays into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| And so the $200,000 had stayed consistent, and so we were asking each year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| is that still a good estimate and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| This year, when it went to $300,000, we started asking questions because that's a 50% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| When we asked about it, we were told what the criteria were, and so we said we need some detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| We need to know how you got the $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| So first one thing came to another, and then these various discussions that we talked about that we had with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| determined that there was also a similar benefit at the schools, which was probably even more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| Now, keep in mind, before I go any further, keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| these are the types of liabilities that are only recorded on the first set of books I talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| the ones that's called government-wide, the ones that's done once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| It has nothing to do with budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| It has nothing to do with daily operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| It has nothing to do with how you operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| You go along for 12 months, and you're doing the fund-level accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| and then all of a sudden at year-end, you have to start thinking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| what are all the different accruals I need to book for the year-end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| What are the accruals, assets, and liabilities I need to put on the books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| And so that's how that process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| So after this audit is done and we move into or the county looks at monthly accounting going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3757)|
| 1:02:47| those adjustments will not even be on their books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| It's just done once a year and then pulled back off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| That's just a little extra information just to kind of clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| But both of these accruals involve all of the employees who, at this point, have qualified to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| So, in other words, it's not what we think that employee 1, 2, 3 would get if they retired in another 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3785)|
| 1:03:16| These are people that have already met the qualifications for retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| So all they have to do at this point is say, I'm giving you 100-day notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| or whatever the notice is at the schools versus the county because there are two different criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| And they give notice, and they can be paid for their unused sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| The reason this doesn't show up, you know, auditors look at subsequent events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| They look at big payouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| They look at things that are unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| This shows up when it's paid just as part of compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| So it wasn't like a check that we would be seeing after a year in that was paid out that would be a subsequent event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| that we'd say, hey, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| It's also another thing that alerted us to this situation in the current year was the county had what's called a reduction in force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3839)|
| 1:04:07| voluntary reduction in force in this current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| And various, I don't know how many, were there 100 employees who took advantage of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| Seventy-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Seventy-something employees took advantage of this voluntary reduction in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| So many of those people received this benefit, made it more visual to notice and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3860)|
| 1:04:34| So at the school's version, the school level, the Board of Education level, and you'll see this in one of our recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3874)|
| 1:04:43| there was no disclosure of this benefit in the employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| So one of the things we always do in an audit is look at the employee handbook and talk about what are your benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| what are the kind of things you have going on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| And so there was nothing in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| But there is a footnote on the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| If you go online and look at the schools, they publish all their pay scales online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| And so you can see it on there, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| And one of our recommendations is to do a more comprehensive listing of your benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| So I'm going to stop there and take a breath and see if you have any questions on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3914)|
| 1:05:25| Just a little extra clarification on this finding, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| So what you're saying, I'm seeing, you know, adjustments that you found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| Is it just that this is something we have not been accounting for in our budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| Is this accruing the minute someone hits retirement age, but maybe they have not yet retired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| So let's say you hit retirement age, so you're now someone that could retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| And then are we telling our finance team to now go back for each person that reaches retirement age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| to book a liability for the sick pay and vacation payout on our books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| So does that mean that we haven't been budgeting for that cash flow of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| You've been budgeting for it each year as you come along on each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| So there's an estimate in the budget for how many of those people are going to retire in the current year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| What you haven't been estimating and accruing is all the people that are going to retire in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| If everybody walked in the doors today and said, we're retiring, the number we recorded is the amount you would owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| So is this like a net present value of that potential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| It's not present value, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| We actually talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| You could assign a calculation or you could do a presentation at present value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| We did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| But that's a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| You could make the number smaller by saying what's the present value of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| Well, no, I'd rather have the big one because that accounts for something that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| And I've seen similar things, you know, either on our pension board as we're trying to manage these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| And this is not an actuarial calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| You know, there's something to be said for the fact that some of these people now ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4026)|
| 1:07:14| But it's a potential expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Yes, this is the worst case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| It's a worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| It's a conservative worst case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| It's a potential liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| We're not seeing that impact our cash flow because they're not all doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| But we're looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| So this is a non-cash flow accounting for a potential liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| If everybody, the reality of we have this much potential expense that could hit right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| reality is it might be spread out over a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| It could be 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| We just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| And, you know, a lot of the retirement qualifications are people can be in their 50s and qualify for retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4062)|
| 1:07:50| So some of these people are not necessarily past 65 and eligible to retire, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| it could be even further for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I mean, with our workforce aging, I mean, it could come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Larry, just to clarify, I think maybe, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| a better term than potential liability is probably expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| The 20-something million, that's our expected liability, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Did I say potential somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Commissioner Nystrom said I think he was saying it was worst case of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| But that's expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| That's what we believe we will owe in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Just for further clarification, you can see that we show there, for example, on the county version, the 2.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4115)|
| 1:08:44| And the reason the county is less than the schools is just the numbers and more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4124)|
| 1:08:52| Yes, they're plummeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| But you can see that the liability actually decreased in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| If you look at the 2.3 million, that's what the number was at the beginning of 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| the beginning of fiscal year that we just audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| During the year, it decreased by $240,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| And at the end of the year, it was only 2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| The reason was the reduction in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| So you lost a bunch of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Not lost, but a bunch of people retired, lowered that liability, so it went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| Schools, on the other hand, the beginning number was 11.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| It increased by 1.4 million, and at year end, it was 13.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| Best I remember, I'm not sure that the school's finance team is prepared to answer this question or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| but I think that they've been paying out about $1 million a year for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| And that's being budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| It's just the total future-looking number is not budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| So, Larry, you're projecting this for all employees or just those who have ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4197)|
| 1:10:05| you don't have to reach the retirement age or whatever the qualifications are to get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| You have to be qualified to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| So, yes, this is only people who have qualified to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| I misunderstood because that didn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| No, this is only the ones who could walk in today and claim their money now if they wanted to after they gave notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4218)|
| 1:10:26| Basically, what are some of the thresholds for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| Years of experience, I think, and the county and the board have two different sets of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| It might be 25 years of experience and 50 years old, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| I'm not saying 75 years old, but 25 and 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| But there's various things, age, number of years of experience, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| And I think one of the other things is that you would qualify for, on one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| I don't remember which it was, but one, if you qualified for retirement with the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| I think that was the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| That clarifies because I misunderstood when you initially said if anybody walks in, you mean who's eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| So, Larry or Chris, we've got this liability on the books every year, 200,000, but the annual payout is actually a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4272)|
| 1:11:20| No, the million was the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| The liability that you first saw year after year being voted was about 200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| but the actual schools payout each year that was being budgeted and paid out was a million approximately, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4295)|
| 1:11:43| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| A million three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| But my point is quite a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| The question is, you would think that somebody would pick up on it, look at the financials each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4312)|
| 1:12:02| So my question is, what was kind of the root cause here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| Well, the million three of payout at the schools wasn't something that we were aware of until we started looking into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| That's just facts we found out later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Yeah, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| I'm just trying to figure out what was the cause of the misstatement year after year after year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| How come somebody didn't pick up on it sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Not you guys, per se, but somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| Well, if you read the finding, and we're jumping ahead to the finding, but I don't mind that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| If you read the finding, here's the way the preparation of the CAFR works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| And actually it's very similar to the way the monthly financial statements work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| The schools have their own finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| They send requests across the street to the finance department of the county for approval of payments, approval of disbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4368)|
| 1:12:58| The county finance department acts as the keeper of the books, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| Requests for transactions, journal entries, anything related to the books goes from them to the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4385)|
| 1:13:14| At year end, and let me say one more thing, the schools don't use the government-wide financial statements at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| Their focus is on fund financials, cash basis, what it takes to operate daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| They're not concerned with the CAFR that's done at year end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| One of our recommendations, one of our very strong recommendations, is that they become more involved in that CAFR presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| that they have actually, for lack of a better thing or better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4421)|
| 1:13:49| maybe put together a package of information for the CAFR that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| here's all the accruals that we think need to be made for the CAFR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| Here's all the disclosures. Here's all the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| Here's all the presentations that should be involved in our portion of the CAFR so that you pick up on all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| So what's happening now is the county finance department is preparing the CAFR as it relates to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4447)|
| 1:14:15| and also preparing the CAFR as it relates to the schools without a lot of school involvement as far as government-wide entries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4455)|
| 1:14:25| And Chris might want to talk some more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| but our recommendation is that it be more of a team approach and that they both be very involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| because it does affect things like this that come out later do affect both as far as people looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| and saying, just like you're saying, what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Just in full disclosure, Larry and I have had ongoing dialogue about this for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4484)|
| 1:14:53| I ask that question for the benefit of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| Larry is probably wondering, why am I telling you this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| That's the background on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| I was going to ask Chris the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| This is something, as we budget for moving from audit to cash flow management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| is this something that has been managed in terms of over the years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| We've known that usually these people retire and these payments usually take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| but is this going to impact our day-to-day cash operating budget dramatically at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| So is this not a cash flow item that could affect future budgets unless suddenly our entire employment base wants to retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4531)|
| 1:15:39| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| I think a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| One thing I would point to first is the point that Larry made, that we basically have two sets of books here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| One is government-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| One is kind of our day-to-day stuff that we care more about and focus on for 12 months of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| And so Gary at schools would budget for his expenses of this retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| We would budget for ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| It gets paid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| We pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Everybody's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Year-end, as we start to prepare the CAFR, we would look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| Every year we do a report on what we call compensated absences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| And usually that just deals with annual leave payout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| I don't think for us we ever really connected that sick leave to our compensated absences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4578)|
| 1:16:29| Furthermore, that report that we get on compensated absences is all employees annually that could be paid out, so it's booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| This report on sick leave, you can't just get a report on everybody and book it because it's on everybody that's eligible to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| And so I don't think we had, in our department, we had never really took that sick leave policy from our standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| And our policy was passed in 2015, I think, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| Schools were furthered back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| And I don't think those discussions ever happened to where we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| oh, yeah, this is a long-term liability that should be booked on government-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| because it really wasn't having an impact on us from our day-to-day standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| We're fine on cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| We're fine on paying those expenses out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| We budget for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| And so government-wide is something that we look at once a year when we prepare our annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| And so it never really kind of clicked that we should do one with the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| And so as we had these discussions this year, we were like, oh, yeah, that should be booked as a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| Now, we did struggle with what amount to book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| We ended up booking the more conservative amount because we could sit here and argue and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| well, are they getting paid the $100 or the $60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| Will some of these make it to retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| You can go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| So how should you discount that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| We decided to book the full number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| And so for us, I think it's something that hits the government-wide statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| that never had affected us day-to-day, and so that's why it really never got looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| Yeah, and on some of these, I'll add something to what Chris said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| We did use the $100 a day so it would be more conservative or a larger number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| But one thing that could decrease the number, and we can't estimate it at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| is if one of the retirees who has $10,000 built up of sick leave, they haven't retired yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| but they get cancer, they get sick, and they use all that sick leave before they retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4716)|
| 1:18:43| That number comes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| We can't estimate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| We thought about doing some kind of an 80%, 90%, but it would be a guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| and so we felt better using the higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| It's only going to go on your books once a year, so put the worst-case number out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| It could come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| I don't think it can get any higher than what we've got, but it could get lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4746)|
| 1:19:17| Okay, so since we kind of got into that, let's talk about the recommendations that we have on that particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| We recommend that the county and the board finance departments individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| and jointly review the year-end CAFR to determine that all applicable entries are recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| including any changes or updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| I think we need to have the two departments meet quarterly or at least semi-annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| to talk about, hey, we implemented a new policy this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| We implemented a new procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| We got a new benefit that we just started offering our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4789)|
| 1:19:57| Where are you at right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| Well, I jumped over to the second report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| Okay, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| What page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Instead of trying to repeat everything later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| But I can keep going for this if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| I just want to know what page you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| Okay, let's go back to page 7 where we were on the report I was in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| because there's another piece of this that we need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| So the board's number for that is 11.9 million and 2.3 for the county that we booked as a beginning year of 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4825)|
| 1:20:34| Okay, there's a second large entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| It has a whole different set of circumstances, a whole different explanation on how this came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| This benefit is a post-employment retirement benefit for certified personnel that are in the teacher's legacy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4843)|
| 1:20:54| That is where these teachers are offered health insurance through this defined benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| that is administered through Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System, TCRS, in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4860)|
| 1:21:07| So the teachers who qualify, or not necessarily teachers, but school personnel, board personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4867)|
| 1:21:16| covers retirees who are in the legacy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| It also covers other employees, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| It's an agent multi-employer defined benefit OPEB plan administered by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| It's a self-insured plan at TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| So we are a participant in their plan, which is self-insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| The liability that we're recording is the liability that represents the estimate of future health care costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| on these retirees compared to the premium that they're paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| So it's a complicated calculation, but the liability represents the future health care costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4906)|
| 1:21:56| that will not be covered by those retirees' premium because they're paying the same premium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| that everybody else is paying that's in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| So even though I'm 70 years old, 65 years old, I'm paying the same premium as everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| which is not going to cover my future health care costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| So there's this liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| The way this one came about is that GASB 75, which I talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4935)|
| 1:22:24| is going to have to be implemented in June of 18 year end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| and it will require plans of this nature to have an actuarial calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| The way it is right now, it's not an actuarial calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| It has some actuarial characteristics to it that are provided by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| but the full-blown actuarial calculation will be done for the first time in 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| So we started talking about implementing 75 in the current year, what kinds of plans would qualify for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4968)|
| 1:22:58| and the fact that the county had one of these already similar that was going to have to be actuarially computed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4978)|
| 1:23:06| and in conversation became aware that schools had one too that was not being calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4986)|
| 1:23:15| So the payments that are made into this plan are just health care premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| So if you look at the books and you look at payments that are being made from the schools each month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| each year, quarterly, however long it is, they just look like health care premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| So you can't tell by the characteristic of the payment that's going out the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| that it's actually part of a plan that's an OPEB-GASB-45 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5014)|
| 1:23:42| GASB-45 said that you had to record these kinds of liabilities back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5022)|
| 1:23:49| So from 2008 until now, there's been a lot of county finance directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| and a lot of auditors going through this thing and not put it on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| So we went back, the county went back to 2008 and calculated it coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5040)|
| 1:24:08| and got this number that's discussed here of $10.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| Here again, it doesn't affect the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| It doesn't affect daily operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| It's just simply an accrual that has to be made under this government-wide set of books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5058)|
| 1:24:26| where you record all your liabilities and all your assets that you would not accrue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| or would not record under the cash basis or fund level accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| So the state provides information to calculate this with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5076)|
| 1:24:46| It was our understanding that the state was sending this to someone in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| I'm not sure where, county-wide, school-wide, but it wasn't going to the right place to get it recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| So here again, another benefit that wasn't on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| and we think our recommendations that we've proposed would keep this one from happening too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5103)|
| 1:25:16| You want to say anything on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| It's very similar but very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| I'll just make a comment for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| One thing to think about, why is this important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| I think of a couple different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| First of all, we want our financials to be accurate every year so they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| I've been in this not as long as Larry, but long enough to know that every year things come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| Every audit has findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| But one thing for you guys to think about on this is another reason why this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| When you get these unique kind of findings, and Larry was talking about working with Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| or going back to 2008 trying to calculate this and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| that probably, time from now, falls under the umbrella of extended scope work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| And so there is a cost of that kind of stuff to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5168)|
| 1:26:15| So that's just one more reason why that matters to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5175)|
| 1:26:24| It matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Yeah, it definitely does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| Sorry, Larry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| I will talk some more about our recommendations when we get into this other booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| So moving on to page eight, this is a required document that we put in this presentation, this disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| that's a draft of the management representation letter that has been signed by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5205)|
| 1:26:56| There's a similar letter that's tailored to different situations at the schools that also has been signed also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5216)|
| 1:27:10| And we also ask each one of the constitutional officers' offices, trustee, Fourth Circuit, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| we have all of them sign a similar representation letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| The purpose of a representation letter is to, it has several purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| but one of them is to simply ask everyone who has provided you information on the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5246)|
| 1:27:33| to represent that they have been forthcoming, they've been honest, they've been cooperative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| they haven't held back anything, that they haven't not told you about anything that you need to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| that there's not liabilities that you're aware of that are coming down the pike that nobody has told you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| It's a very helpful tool for both of us because it helps us as auditors get a feeling of comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5270)|
| 1:27:58| that you are being forthcoming on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| It also gives those who sign the letter a checklist, so to speak, of did I do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5281)|
| 1:28:08| Did I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Did I tell them about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| You know, hey, this question is asking me, do I know about any contingent liabilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| There is one that I forgot to tell them about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| So it is helpful to both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| In people filling this out, and Chris, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| or Larry made it sound like maybe you flow this down to certain levels of people within your organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| or in the county other than just the final signature, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| You can see on the very last page who signs it for county finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| Mayor Burchett signs it as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| Chris signs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| Perry signs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Melanie Wilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| And then we asked Tony Blevins to sign it this particular year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| because we had some special work at the health department that had grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| that he specifically helped us with this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Did anybody have any issues with any part of this who was signing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5337)|
| 1:29:05| On the county side, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| Was that a qualifying response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| It sounded like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| I was just responsible for the county side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| and so I took it to the mayor and Perry and Melanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| We had no issues, and it was signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| I think from the others that had to be signed that Larry kind of drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5368)|
| 1:29:38| I think in the end they were all fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| I think there was some massaging of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| but I don't think there was anything that was detrimental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| Full disclosure, there was an issue at this ñ not an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| but there was a process we went through with the schools, the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| where Mr. Gary Spencer, who is here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| asked us to allow him to change the wording on some of the parts of the rep letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| to be more in tune with the way they actually flow information over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| So, for example, if you look at this letter, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| ìWe are responsible for the fair presentation of the financial statements.î| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| His point was, ìWe don't prepare the financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| The county finance prepares those.î| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| His point was, ìWe feed them information, and they do the financials.î| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| So he took the representations that were being asked of ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| we actually handed him one, asked them to sign one just exactly like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| but he came back with some suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| and tailored it to be more in line with the process that they followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| I've had a couple of controllers do that with some of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| Did you want to say anything about that, Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| Did I do okay on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5455)|
| 1:31:07| Larry, you were good with that revised language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| You thought it was a reflection of ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| Well, we did have some discussions verbally on some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| that were taken out of the letter that I felt like were important for me to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| In fact, I did ask the superintendent some of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| that I felt like were important enough to ask verbally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| since they weren't in the letter about contingent liabilities and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| and I got satisfied with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| I think it's important that we not ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| I think it's very important that we get to the point with this audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| that we don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| I think it's very important that we get these suggestions implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| such that they can feel comfortable signing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| that the financial statements are fairly studied in relation to their part of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5510)|
| 1:31:57| I think that in order for this to be a good system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| that if the recommendations that we have in our other report here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| if they'll be followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| I don't think people in the future will have a problem signing the rep letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| because they'll be involved in the preparation of the financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| They'll be more involved with the numbers and be more confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| that their side of the financial statements have been accurately presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| so that they can sign it without having to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| As I said earlier, the board is a larger piece of the total pie than the county is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5553)|
| 1:32:41| and so they need to feel comfortable with those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5561)|
| 1:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| Let's go to the second report, the thicker of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| It's called the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| This report is required whenever you have a ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| when you have grants and government funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| or state and federal government financial assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| Hey, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| Sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| It's 333.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Time's a-ticking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Ted hadn't got started yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| I don't know what Chris has to add, but just kind of be mindful of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| Which letter are you going over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| I thought maybe you were going to go to the findings in one of the other letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| That's it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| This letter starts on page one, and there's two letters in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| The first letter is called the Yellow Book Letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| that requires us to tell you about any material weaknesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| or significant deficiencies that relate to financial reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| So, in other words, do we know of any weaknesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| any findings that take into ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| that affect the ability of the county and the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| to prepare financial statements fairly stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| So, if you look, flip to page two and just get to the heart of the matter here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| we have one finding that we think is a material weakness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| which relates to these two prior period adjustments we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| and we have some strong recommendations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| We feel like 217.002 and 003 that are disclosed in the back are significant deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| And the best way to describe a significant deficiency is a weakness in internal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| that is less severe than a material weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| There is no other better way to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| It's less severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| The second letter is what's called the Single Audit Letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| Major federal programs report on internal control of compliance, expenditures of federal awards and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| This letter requires you to disclose findings that relate to compliance issues on grants or laws or regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5697)|
| 1:35:07| and also internal control findings that relate to the internal controls over compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| So it's really all about compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| This letter changed slightly from the one we sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| I want you to know what we changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| The one that you have in front of you is the final version that I'm going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| The one that we sent you down in the third paragraph from the bottom on page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5729)|
| 1:35:36| we only had 217.002 and 217.003 listed as deficiencies in internal control over compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5736)|
| 1:35:44| We added four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| That's kind of the technicality is what we labeled it because we felt like that four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| and five also had to do with internal control too and not just compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| If that makes a difference to you, I want you to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Starting on page six is just a listing of all the grants, all the federal awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5761)|
| 1:36:10| This is something that you should be proud of is all this money that came in from the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| as a federal award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| We audit this schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| And then going over to starting on page 12, and you can see the total federal expenditures in the current year was $66 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5779)|
| 1:36:31| So that's something to be very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| The next page on page 13 is state financial assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| and we had a total on that on page 15 of $5.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5800)|
| 1:36:48| Let's skip over to page 18, which is a schedule of findings and questions and costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5808)|
| 1:36:57| This is kind of a summary of this letter on what we found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| and this is a prescribed form that is required to be in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| It goes in with the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| We did have a material weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| We did have a significant deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| Noncompliance material to the financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| The answer to that was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| Talking about compliance, noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| Federal awards, significant deficiency, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Material weakness, no, because it wasn't over a federal program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5844)|
| 1:37:32| And then the bottom discloses the major federal programs, which ones they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5852)|
| 1:37:43| For this year, you qualified as a low-risk oddity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| You see at the very bottom there it says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Next year you will not because you had a material weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| So there again translates into cost when you have dropped down a level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| from a low-risk oddity to a high-risk oddity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| I'll point out, too, for the newer folks on this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| when I started on it, I guess, four years ago, we were not low-risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| It took a couple years to get built up to low-risk, and now we're back from a historical perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5896)|
| 1:38:30| Larry, we're going to be, by default, not low-risk for more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5910)|
| 1:38:39| I think you have to go two years without a material weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| Two consecutive years without a material weakness to be low-risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| Starting on page 19 is the findings, which we've already discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| so I don't see any reason to go over those again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| I do want to reiterate our recommendations at the bottom of page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| We recommend that you begin jointly reviewing the CAFR, that you meet quarterly or monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| or some regular period of time to discuss accounting matters between the two departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5946)|
| 1:39:15| Consider designating an individual in the finance department to coordinate with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| in the preparation of the board's portion of the CAFR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| And the use of a comprehensive governmental financial reporting disclosure checklist could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5965)|
| 1:39:33| Now, just a reminder, it's going to be the end of June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| before we have these government-wide entries recorded again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| so I think we can go ahead and start the regular meetings just to get the communication opened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| and discussions started, but discussions about government-wide entries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| it's not a monthly accrual or a monthly recording, so it won't be recorded again until June of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| Is there a response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| Oh, I see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| They're down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| The response is on the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| I kind of wanted to ask about the response, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| The board response says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Board will consider the recommendations in light of the budgetary constraints placed on staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| and operations of the board finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| So what does that mean, I guess, is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| Is there some concern here that may not have the manpower to comply with the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6030)|
| 1:40:38| or implement it as written, or what have we got here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| Are you talking to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| I'm talking to whoever wants to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| I'm sorry, I thought you were talking to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| Yeah, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| This is the board's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| I'm aiming this toward the board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| Gary Spencer, Executive Vice President of Finance for the Knox County School District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| Yes, that's exactly what the response is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| We live under the budgetary constraints of what we can staff within the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| If this is going to require a half a person or a quarter of a person, I've got to have more money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| That's exactly what that response means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| Okay, so have you asked for more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| We're in the process of the new budgetary year, and that probably will be part of the request, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| I guess I didn't see that as maybe requiring that much of someone's time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| I didn't know if that could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| I can tell you just on these two adjustments I had my supervisor recounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| he probably spent the better part of a month and a half on those two adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| I can certainly understand that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| but keeping it straight going forward doesn't seem like it would be that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| Well, that's my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| That's my analysis of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6122)|
| 1:42:13| So I don't know if anybody else has a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| but it sounds like we're sort of in limbo on this one as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| or not there's going to be resources committed to address the auditor's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6143)|
| 1:42:31| I don't know if the commissioners have any thought, comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| Well, I know we're going through our AOP process right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| and I'm sure Chris Caldwell and his team will give that a hard look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| I mean, so that's I guess what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| Yeah, I think this finding is a bit, it's not comprehensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| because we do meet with county finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| We meet or we communicate basically on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| Perry communicates with my supervisor of accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| I communicate with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| So back to what Larry was saying, these are end-of-the-year adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| Certainly we can put more effort in doing that, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| my board needs to understand that this is additional work for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| and that I might need additional resources to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| So I don't want that to be ruled out in this upcoming budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6211)|
| 1:43:41| And these three individuals over here ultimately vote on my budget, whether I get it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6221)|
| 1:43:53| All I'm trying to do is just be clear here on the response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| and make sure that everybody understands that it's tough to kind of describe this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6236)|
| 1:44:09| There's a tentative response here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6249)|
| 1:44:18| If you guys don't have any other questions about it, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| And the second statement there is regarding the publication of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6263)|
| 1:44:30| that's not our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| That's the responsibility of the Benefits Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| which we've passed this recommendation on to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| and they can address it as far as the publication within the employee manual of sick leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6277)|
| 1:44:45| basic day payout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6285)|
| 1:45:10| Go ahead, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| The second finding relates to purchasing policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| And just jumping to the recommendations there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| we're recommending some significant changes to procurement policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| dollar amounts for approvals of POs and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| improvements to the level of budgetary control in the procurement office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| And this is just related to improving the procurement and purchasing policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6335)|
| 1:45:47| And I think management agreed with all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6347)|
| 1:45:59| You'll notice on some of these where they relate to the board and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| there were two separate responses on all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| Any questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| So it sounds like the board had more actions to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| and they list the things they've implemented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| Am I reading that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| Whereas county finance didn't have the actions to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Well, I think the board's response actually says that it has actually implemented the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Their plan would be more complete or more detailed because they've actually done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| The county hasn't formulated their plan yet, so it's less detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6395)|
| 1:46:43| So the county has more to respond on this or to comply with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| Or what am I hearing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| I think what we have said is we're going to sit down with the procurement office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| and look at our procurement code on some of the things that were recommended by the auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6417)|
| 1:47:09| So whether it's a predetermined dollar amount, should that be in our code, it's not currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6429)|
| 1:47:16| So we'll examine those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| I know part of our discussion as well was at the level at which we approve our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6439)|
| 1:47:25| and that was discussed during this one, that would require a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| That would have to be like we just did through the changing of the auditor's stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| And so things like that we'll have to implement long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| And so we basically approve our budget at a lower level than what they're normally used to seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6461)|
| 1:47:49| So we're pretty kind of constrained a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| And I really wasn't very familiar with the findings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| I'd seen this, but it didn't really soak in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| I really didn't understand the impact of what all it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| Yeah, I can go through it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| I'm just trying to in the interest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I think these folks are okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| We're checking now to make sure the room's available after four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| Ted, real quick, how much time do you feel like you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| I can do it in ten minutes or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| Larry, proceed quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| Okay, the third comment on page 23 relates to e-cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6517)|
| 1:48:44| Those of you who have been on the committee in the past know that we've had other findings in the past about e-cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| But this one relates to approvals of credit limits, approvals of transactions by persons at their own level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6529)|
| 1:49:01| The condition number one says during our audit we noted that purchases made on several department e-cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| Just to give you a little bit more information there, it was four out of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| We tested six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| Four of them were not reviewed by someone above their level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| In some cases, there was no other review than the individual themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| So we're recommending that that be corrected due to a lack of segregation of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| Noted a lack of consistent documentation related to credit limits for employee and contract cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6567)|
| 1:49:35| We saw some cards where the card was approved for issuance to an employee and the credit limit was not filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| The boxes were blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| So the credit limit was determined later on and was approved either verbally or some other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| but it wasn't gone back and put onto the original application to document that properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| So we're recommending that be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| I think there was some thought to even taking the amount off of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| so that the amount didn't have to be determined until later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| But it certainly shouldn't be blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| I think what happens in that situation is as some cards get approved through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| they could be a combination of things from a contract card to just a regular e-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| And so what are their budgetary amounts in that department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| So a lot of times we will get the card approved and then go back and set an amount as far as a credit limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6629)|
| 1:50:36| What we have said we're going to do and change is let the card approval go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6636)|
| 1:50:43| without an amount attached to that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| And then on the back end, we will assign an amount to the card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| but send it to the supervisor for approval of that amount and put that in the card file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| Are you looking at the response on page 24?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| Yeah, I think our response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| Yeah, I'm just trying to read real fast and find that all in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| because I assume once you set the limit, the processing of the cards won't go above that limit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6669)|
| 1:51:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| There is a process to get that limit increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| And that's another recommendation that we document that approval better than what it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| How many cards are outstanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| We've got 175, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| 75?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| Larry, you said you guys tested six, found four exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| Was there any reason to expand testing or why did you choose not to or what was the deal there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| Well, at the point, you have four out of six exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Further testing would just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| Yeah, the four out of the six was just the ones that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| We tested other things on other cards, but these were the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| These were the six that we tested for this particular purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| Yeah, this was a specific test on approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| But to answer your question, once you had four errors out of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| Yeah, they failed, no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| An F is an F, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| The next finding was on compliance with federal awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| and you see that we repeat two and three there because they were both federal award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6757)|
| 1:52:44| I mean, internal control findings, also compliance findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| So they're repeated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| But then 04 was a request for reimbursement by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| There's a process that goes through every month to get reimbursements, to get paid on the grant funding and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6773)|
| 1:53:04| and there were two months here where the reimbursement was not processed quicker than three to four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6784)|
| 1:53:12| and there wasn't an appropriate follow-up to make sure as to why it hadn't been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| And so our recommendation basically says to develop a process to follow up on that quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6798)|
| 1:53:24| and to make sure those slow receipts don't happen anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6804)|
| 1:53:31| I think what happens is the money comes into the trustee's office and then it may sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| It may get parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| And so even though the money was received by the county, it wasn't received by the nutrition department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| Hey, Chris, on those, when the money's just sitting there, it's a fairly substantial amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| The trustee's office, I assume it's an interest-bearing account, or I hope it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| I'm pretty positive, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| The only reason I'm asking, who's the beneficiary of that interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| Do they pass that along to the cafeteria folks or do they just keep it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6845)|
| 1:54:14| The only reason I ask is because I would like to be able to draw interest on $2 million of this county's money for a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6854)|
| 1:54:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| That's a pretty good rate, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| Really, I think that rate goes, I think interest goes to general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6866)|
| 1:54:32| So I don't think, regardless of where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| I don't think it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| In fairness to the person who kept track of that, she did have a schedule that showed that those two had not been received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6881)|
| 1:54:48| but there wasn't follow-up to make sure that it got received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| I mean, the schedule was there, it just wasn't followed up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| Okay, number five then was, here again, when you get into compliance issues, you may look at this one and say, well, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| one school didn't count heads instead of counting meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| But when you get into compliance with federal government awards, one out-of-compliance issue causes you to write the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| So materiality doesn't come into play on this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| But we tested three schools where we actually showed up at mealtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| and looked at their processed account to watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| and observe how they counted students who received reimbursable meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| so that the federal government's money was being appropriately accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| In one of the schools, as opposed to counting heads or using a clicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| or counting students as they walked through, they actually counted the meals they had before they started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| counted the meals they had when they got done, and the difference was what they turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| So we all know what could be happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| You could be dropping one on the floor, you could be taking two home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| you could be somebody that didn't qualify for a meal could be getting one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| So that's not the process that's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| You are actually supposed to count heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6964)|
| 1:56:14| And in the back of the report is the corrective action plans that have been turned in to respond to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| There has to be a response for our report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| and then the federal government requires you to actually have a formal on-your-letterhead type response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6982)|
| 1:56:31| that responds with actually an anticipated completion date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| These are a little bit more defined, a little bit more technical than the ones in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| So you can see which quarter of which year they're going to be cleared and who's going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7001)|
| 1:56:51| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| Thank you for that succinct report, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| I did the best I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7018)|
| 1:57:10| Okay, Larry's given me four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| Well, three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| I won't make three minutes, but I will be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| You can have a few extra minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| For the record, I'm Ted Hotz with Pew CPAs, and I want to talk about three engagements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7041)|
| 1:57:28| although two will be extremely quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| First, as the Pension Board audit was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| I just want to let you know as the audit committee that I did an overview at the January meeting of the audit report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7054)|
| 1:57:41| and I'm going to come back in February and go through the report in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| So the Pension Board is informed on the audit and will continue to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| and we'll have a final presentation at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| Larry mentioned the TCRS report, and basically that was an examination of census data required by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7075)|
| 1:58:03| We found one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| The exception was at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| It wasn't at the local level, so really nothing further to follow up on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| And again, it was for the purpose of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| So with that said, one minute down, I've got two reports out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| We'll go to the talk about the Knox County schools, internal school funds audit, and it is in draft form right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7099)|
| 1:58:28| You have the majority of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| There's a couple of sections that are not in there, but the primary sections are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| except for the corrective action plans, which are available and will be added to the final report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7114)|
| 1:58:41| There's also supplemental pay sections and transfer schedules that will go in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| But you do have, in what I emailed you this morning, copies of the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7126)|
| 1:58:52| They're not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| And you have copies of all the balance sheets and income statements of all schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| This audit is an audit of 88 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| We basically do a mini audit of each school so that you have an idea of the dollars involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7142)|
| 1:59:10| Total cash held at June 30, 2017, of all 88 schools was over $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7150)|
| 1:59:19| In addition, you look at it from an income statement perspective, total expenses were, expenditures were over $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7159)|
| 1:59:28| So a lot of small transactions, but they add up to significant dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| The report, the finding sections in the very back, and that's what we normally spend the majority of the time on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7173)|
| 1:59:41| there were 12 findings this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| Three were new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| One was resolved from the prior year and gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| Just quickly on the new findings, probably not as bad as it sounds for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7189)|
| 1:59:57| We focused significantly on travel expenses and travel policies the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7197)|
| 2:00:04| and we did have a finding on the implementation of a new travel form, which was not fully following procedure yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7204)|
| 2:00:14| But, again, the form was new, and we expect to see significant improvement on that in the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7214)|
| 2:00:23| I think the process they're going through is very healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| The implementation of it is a little slow right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| But I think we'll see, like I said, significant improvement in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| Another finding is one that's been there most years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| It deals with supplemental pay, and there's an exception in how supplemental pay was handled for one employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7238)|
| 2:00:46| And the final new one dealt with approval of journal entries and a little more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7246)|
| 2:00:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| You have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| Ed, I'm struggling to find which letter, where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| Prior to our meeting, I handed out an 11-page document with a red preliminary stamp on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7258)|
| 2:01:06| Is that the one with the schedule of the findings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| Yes, schedule of findings and responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| Which one are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| I'm really just trying to go from an overview perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| Just as a reference, the travel one that I mentioned is number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7279)|
| 2:01:31| The approval of journal entries is number 10, and the supplemental pay is number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| So the last three in there were the new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| Okay, good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| Definitely should be noted that one finding, a significant finding, went away this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| That's the negative balance, negative fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| We had a few schools, and we've had it for, like, I guess all the six years that we've done the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7312)|
| 2:01:59| where there have been some funds that have had a negative fund balance at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| which shouldn't happen, and very glad to report that there were none this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7324)|
| 2:02:10| and thus we removed that finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| Kind of as an overview of the next thing I'd really like to do is kind of compare the status of different findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7333)|
| 2:02:22| from one year to the other because I think it's important to keep in context or keep in perspective that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7342)|
| 2:02:29| we're testing 88 schools, multiple transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| You have turnover of bookkeepers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| You have turnover of principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| A lot of the findings are not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| What I think is significant, though, is how do they compare to prior years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| what procedures are in place to try and improve the system and improve the monitoring of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| So I'm going to talk about that for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| Areas that kind of declined were where we had more exceptions, basically, were number four, receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7376)|
| 2:03:05| number five, purchase orders, and number six, ticket reconciliations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7385)|
| 2:03:13| The majority of the other areas were about the same, although, of course, negative fund balances went away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7393)|
| 2:03:20| and while the write-up of segregation of duties, number one, is similar to what we've seen before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7400)|
| 2:03:30| I think it is important to note that the level of lack of segregation of duties has improved over prior years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7410)|
| 2:03:42| There might still be a lack of segregation of duties, but there are more steps in place, more checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| So I know there's a conscious effort on Garrett Radin and Gary Spencer's part to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7427)|
| 2:03:56| improve controls to the extent necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| You're not going to completely eliminate this finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| In fact, you're not going to eliminate this finding, but the degree of it I think is relevant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| because to me this finding is as significant as any of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| just because lack of segregation of duties means with the number of transactions you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| there at least is a risk that something will get paid or money will, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| a risk of something going wrong that shouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| So the importance of checks and balances can't be understated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| But again, I've seen improvements in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| and they're trying to at least slowly improve checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7472)|
| 2:04:40| Kind of from a summary standpoint, I noted areas that have declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7480)|
| 2:04:48| Some of the things that I'm seeing from an improvement standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| besides segregation of duties and also the negative fund balances going away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7491)|
| 2:04:58| the training and communication from central office with the principal and bookkeepers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| seems to be increasing and more constant, done at least on a semiannual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| but I know there's regular contact during the year with bookkeepers in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| with Garrett Radin and his assistant Heidi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| So I don't think I mentioned this either yet, but this report for the very first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7520)|
| 2:05:29| at least first time in recent memory, has been presented to the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7529)|
| 2:05:36| It actually was done in two meetings, one meeting where Gary Spencer basically led it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| and went over the numbers part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| and then last night Garrett Radin and I talked about the findings aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| So to break it in, they kind of broke it up into two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| And the school board asked a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| and called for the proper accountability and said a lot of the right things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| So I'm encouraged that they're getting involved in the monitoring of the internal school funds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7567)|
| 2:06:15| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| In the essence of time, I want to kind of open it up to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| I tried to go over it from an overview perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| And keep in mind, again, this for the first year is also evaluated by the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7586)|
| 2:06:34| so I think the controls from that perspective are improving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7594)|
| 2:06:40| and I'm pleased to see that the training is constantly increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7600)|
| 2:06:46| So while findings are similar to a year ago and really even similar to the past couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| there are a lot of steps that are encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7613)|
| 2:06:58| Okay, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| Anything, Ted, that just keeps you up at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| Any of these findings that you think are egregiously significant or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| or you feel pretty good about where the school board's at and the direction they're going, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7632)|
| 2:07:20| I want to say if there are any that keep me up at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| but lack of segregation of duties always makes me a little uneasy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7643)|
| 2:07:30| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| And, again, there are cost benefits aspects to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| There's one bookkeeper in the school, one principal in a limited office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| so it's a challenge to segregate the way you would see a corporate office segregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7661)|
| 2:07:48| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7668)|
| 2:07:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| I'm right at ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| Yeah, you did good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| Well, real quickly, I'd just like to compliment you all on, I guess it was last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| maybe Garrett was here with you all, and you talked about the negative funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| and you knew you could take care of that, and you did, and I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| And I'm not real familiar with your presentation last night to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| I did see the earlier one, and I thought it was great, their response and their interest into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| and I recognized a lot of the questions the first time around as being the same things I would ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| but the more involvement they can have, I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| Yeah, I agree, Jim, and just like Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| I don't know why that that negative fund balance finding being gone makes me so happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7715)|
| 2:08:43| But it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| And when the final report's available, which should be in about a week or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| it will be provided to the audit committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| Well, thank you very much, Ted, for your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| Larry, you've got something there it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| We need to file our CAFR or the county's CAFR and our two reports with the state tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7742)|
| 2:09:09| so we need approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| We need a vote to approve those reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| Okay. A second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| I will second for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| Okay. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| I looked to the law director about what is this requirement here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| that they need to be able to send something to Nashville tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| and that the audit committee's being asked today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| Did we have to do this last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| I was thinking, have we done this before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| I thought the audit just, I mean, you're independent auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| and that's what the state wants to see, so it doesn't make any difference what we say, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| I mean, we don't approve your audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| Typically the committee votes to approve the audit or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| so I was just saying we're going to be sending it in tomorrow, so if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| The motion before us is to receive the audit report of the external auditor, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7802)|
| 2:10:08| That's what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| If it's to receive it, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| but I pass some judgment on it or authorizing him to send it to Nashville I think is outside of our authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7814)|
| 2:10:22| No, I don't have to have your approval to send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| I could have sent it last week, but I'm just saying typically that is part of your protocol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| but I'm not telling you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| No, it's part of the protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| But if we want to accept to receive it, that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| I'll amend my motion that this committee to vote on formally accepting and receiving the CAFR as presented by our auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7840)|
| 2:10:49| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| Larry, I don't remember doing that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| You made our meeting very awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7861)|
| 2:11:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| Chris, are you going to real quick give us just a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7869)|
| 2:11:16| I would just say that it was a very awkward year as it turned out on the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| but we never had any issues with working with Pew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7880)|
| 2:11:24| We had a good relationship, really good discussions that we had over findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7884)|
| 2:11:31| and things like that this year and the prior period adjustments and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| And so usually we're never set aside if we have five findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7895)|
| 2:11:42| We like to be a low-risk oddity, and so that doesn't make us happy when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| And so it's just we always view findings as a way to get better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| and help us to look for things to improve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| And so I think it's what we'll do from this and just improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| and in a couple of years get back to low risk again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| That was for you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| I didn't wear anything too bright or patterned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| That was for you, worried about me commenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| I don't see any members of the public here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| On the subject of not seeing any members of the public today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| it was interesting this morning when I was reviewing my schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7942)|
| 2:12:26| I wanted to make sure that I had my meeting time correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| because I had it on my phone for 2 o'clock, which is when the meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| But I said, well, I'm going to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| And it's interesting with our serve on the pension committee as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| and if you go to the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| we've got a section on the county website that's very clear with all the meetings posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| And if you go to our Knox County Commission meeting agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| we've got an electronic posting with all of our meetings, all of our agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| And then I thought, well, maybe this meeting is clearly posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| on the Knox County Internal Audit section that made the most sense, and it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| There's not, and even when I Googled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| hmm, am I missing something when I Googled Knox County Audit Committee meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| No website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| Yeah, so we need to maybe, in my opinion, find some better ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| And it could be just going to, since internal audit is part of Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| or at least on our Knox County Commission meeting agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| the electronic area to either publicize our agendas or the date that the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| I know we push releases out to the media, but that might make it a little bit easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| If I'm a member of this committee and I'm poking around on our county website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| and there's no area where it pops up easily and I know where to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| then I would guess that the public would even have a harder time doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| So that might make, that's something maybe for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| What I might recommend is we put this on the new incoming chair of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| That's exactly what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| But I would think that maybe, you know, one of the commissioners could talk to Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8044)|
| 2:14:10| Yeah, we could talk to Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| And as these come out, just make sure it gets posted on our normal agenda format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8052)|
| 2:14:20| So that, in our electronic record, which is pretty easy to sort with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| and I think a lot of the commissioners are even programmed to go to look in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| to get prepared for upcoming meetings and those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| And if we crossed it and then had the attachments related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| some of the pre-meeting emails that we've gotten before this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| maybe they could also be sourced up there to make it easier for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| or anybody else who might want to pop in on this meeting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8085)|
| 2:14:52| Yeah, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| I think that's probably a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| The new chair and I will work on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| but I think it's probably just as easy as communicating it to Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| I believe you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| And when I researched how the auditors were rotated, not rotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| or mandatory change out of auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| I became aware a lot of most municipalities and cities I looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| very few of them even had just a website for the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| and whether or not we want to go that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| because I'd like to be able to see some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| I'm always trying to, you know, gather, now, where do I have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| I think the city of Knoxville, actually, for their audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| I saw at least a section on the city of Knoxville's website for the city audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| It doesn't have a lot of content, but it does at least state when they're meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| Yeah, the ones I did see didn't have a lot of depth to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| because you'd go somewhere else to get the audit reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| and financial recovers and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| As we work through this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| that might be an outcome that we try to get to by the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| is to make this a really good functioning website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| Internal audits committee, they've got, you can go in there and you can get their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| we don't know what they're working on currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| but they do have all their past reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| so that could be something, as we set a goal for this committee moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| to make our website transparency, a lot of things, agendas, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| more easily accessible and maybe a new small section on our county website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8177)|
| 2:16:22| I agree with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| Next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Yeah, next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8187)|
| 2:16:34| What are you guys thinking of dates for the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| I almost forgot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| March sometime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8200)|
| 2:16:47| Yeah, March is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| The end of March is the end of the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| March 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| I was just going to say the end of March is the end of my semiannual period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| my other job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| We could do mid-March or thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8221)|
| 2:17:14| 12th or the 19th maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| Work session is the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8236)|
| 2:17:21| Do not make your schedule based on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| March the 19th or 20th are probably not good days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8246)|
| 2:17:31| Even though March 19th is a work session day, it's not a good day for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8251)|
| 2:17:43| What did you say, Jim, the 12th, March 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| And, again, the week in front of it is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8269)|
| 2:17:56| After the 20th or 21st, I'm back in-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| I guess it seems like I thought it would work better with commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| if we did it when they either had the workshop or the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| And that would be a-probably the 19th is a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8287)|
| 2:18:14| It's just that I'll take Schoonmaker's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| Ms. Gill will sit in for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8299)|
| 2:18:20| I will sit in for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| So I believe if everyone is saying the 19th is a good day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| and it's also the work session day, then that's a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| Commissioner Nystrom, are you okay with the 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| I'm quite fine with that because I was going to say the 12th is spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| And so March 19th and time, regular 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8321)|
| 2:18:56| It seems like they have a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8336)|
| 2:18:57| I don't know what else is scheduled that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| Maybe that's why we do 1.30 is to get out here before other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| Hugh, you got 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| I'm putting it on my calendar as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| So March 19th, 1.30 in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| Everybody good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8364)|
| 2:19:25| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180130Auditb?start=8367)|
