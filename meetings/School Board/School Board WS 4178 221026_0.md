| 0:00:35| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=35)|
| 0:00:38| Allegiance led by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=38)|
| 0:00:52| Please face the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=63)|
| 0:01:18| Just a reminder that our November work session is scheduled for Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| November 7th with the regular session to follow on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| Wednesday, November 9th. Both meetings will begin at 5 p.m. in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| this boardroom. I also want to remind everyone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| starting in January, our regular session meetings will move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| from the traditional Wednesday night to Thursday night following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| our work session. Board members, as you know, several of us will be attending the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| Tennessee School Board Association Leadership Conference and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| Annual Convention November 10th through the 13th in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| If there are sessions you would like to register for and have not done so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| already, please let Terry know as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| Also, just want to announce that Reverend Butler will not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| most likely not, make it for the entire meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| So, if he has to leave, it's because of a prior commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| Just to make everyone aware of that. And finally, before we move on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| agenda, I just want to take a moment to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| everyone that this is at the board's meeting and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| is actually the only time we as a board have to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| what comes before us as an elective body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| So, I would ask that everyone treat each other with courtesy and respect at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| times and that everyone refrain from behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| that disrupts the board's meetings. Our meetings are conducted in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| accordance with the Open Meetings Act, but they are for the purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| conducting our business for the Knox County Schools District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| So, please, if there's applause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| booing, groaning, or, you know, if you feel the need to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| something with someone sitting beside you, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| just ask you to be respectful of that and step out of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| And, you know, we certainly don't want to ask people to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| but we do have business that we have to conduct as a board. So, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| ask everyone to be respectful of that. And so, with that being said, are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| any requested changes to this meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| So, we have a motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Henderson. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Superintendent Risewick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. I have some brief updates since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| our last meeting. I'd like to begin by congratulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| Coach Duncan, former athletic director and football coach at South Doyle High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| School, who was recognized at Thursday night's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| game against Carter. Coach Duncan invested countless hours in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| the lives of our students, and I was grateful to be part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| ceremony in the naming of the football field in his honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| and best wishes to you in your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Best wishes to you in your retirement, Coach. I know Ms. Christie was there as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| well, and we were able to be part of that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| that was great. He's a fine guy who's done lots of things at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| multiple schools in his tenure in Knox County, and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| always been great for kids. So, that was a special night for sure. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| would also like to point out that October is National Principals Month, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| good opportunity to reflect on the amazing work done by our principals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| our assistant principals in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| So, if you get a moment this week, please be sure to send your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| administrators an email or a note to let them know how much we appreciate their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| work, and they do. They do so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| things to fill in gaps, even though we don't know every day that they do, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| they do a great job taking care of our teachers and also of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| students. And finally, I want to remind everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| that a special event is happening on November 1st at Bearden High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| School. The documentary, Hiding in Plain Sight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| focuses on the youth mental health crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| and East Tennessee PBS will host a partial viewing of that documentary at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| 6 p.m. So, this is a very important topic to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| us, as we know lots of families and lots of students are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| struggling with mental health issues. So, we think this would be a great chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| to be able to go. Dr. Steven Loy, who is an expert on mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| health and substance abuse, will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| afterwards to be part of that as well. So, it's an event that definitely want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| circle on your calendars. With that, Madam Chair, it concludes my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| report. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| So, next up, we have our charter school authorizer training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| So, is this you again, Dr. Ryslick, or Ms. Thompson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=339)|
| 0:05:47| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to turn that over to Ms. Thompson to set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| So, as Executive Director of Academic Support, I now oversee all things charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=353)|
| 0:06:03| schools in Knox County. And each year, as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| prepare for the upcoming application process, we're required by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| state to provide charter school training for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| the Board of Education, as well as all staff members whose jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| support our charter schools in the event that we have new applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| for charter schools. Tonight, we are fortunate to have Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| Elizabeth Fibash with us from the Tennessee Charter Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| to conduct this training. Ms. Fibash is a former TDOE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| employee serving several roles, most recently as the Assistant Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| for Policy and Legislative Affairs. We appreciate her traveling all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| from Nashville today to conduct this training for the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| and for our staff. She's going to spend about 20 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| going through her PowerPoint, and then there will be time at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| We'll also be glad to share this presentation with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| if you would request that. So, at this time, I'm going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Ms. Fibash to come forward and share this with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| Hi, good evening everyone, and thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=431)|
| 0:07:20| so much for the opportunity to be here. Really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| appreciate your time. Hopefully this is informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| Please feel free to to stop me as I'm going through the presentation if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| have questions. Also, save time for for questions at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| So, just quickly, starting with what is a charter school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| It's definitely a buzzword in education, but a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| folks don't really even understand what a charter school is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| So, essentially a charter school, it is a public school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| and it can be authorized by either the local school board or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| through the Tennessee Public Charter School Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| minutes. So, charter schools operate semi-independently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| according to the terms of a 10-year performance contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| called the charter. Charter schools are free and open to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| students. They can't establish enrollment criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| can't charge admission or tuition, and this goes for all students. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| can't deny enrollment to students based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| disability status, based on their English learner status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| their economically disadvantaged status. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| just like a traditional public school has to enroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| students that no matter what, you know, subgroup they may fall into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| same goes for for charter schools. Charter schools are also held to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| same testing and accountability requirements as all district schools. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| they take the TCAP, TNREADY, they will receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| an A through F letter grade once that rolls out in Tennessee, and so every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| accountability metric is applicable to them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| And then all charter schools, again, commit to meet or exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| specific goals for academic performance, and if they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| they're held to greater accountability in the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| the school board can actually close, revoke the charter, and close the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| if they're not meeting the terms of their charter agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| So, quickly want to touch on the charter school funding under TESA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| This is a question that we get asked a lot, is how charter school funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| works, and it will be different under TESA than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| how it was under the BEP. So, charter schools will receive TESA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| funding based on the actual students that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| they're serving within the current school year. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| just like the district will report students in their ULN, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| unique learning needs under TESA, charter schools will report that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Charter schools will receive additional direct funding allocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| which is fully state funded. That's not subject to the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| match requirement. This is to replace the charter school facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| funding grant that is outside of the funding formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| This folds this into the formula, and then one really important point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| that when the district reports its student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| data to the state, charter school students are included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| that. So, making sure that the district and the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| schools have a really solid data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| reporting system, making sure that the district fully understands what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| the charter school is reporting is going to be very important because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| could impact the district's funding if it's not done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| properly. So, we want to make sure that if there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| help that the district or charter school needs in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| of making sure that reporting is accurate, we are more than happy to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| to help facilitate that because I know that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| sometimes a big task, but again so important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| moving forward under TESA. And then TESA also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| included a provision around the federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| So, the current state law is silent on how federal funds are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| distributed to charter schools, but under TESA it requires that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| LEA must disperse funding, federal funds to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| charter school either through grants based on the the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| students they're serving, so that any of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| the proportionate share of the grant based on the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| or through a joint shared services agreement. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| if there are services that the district is providing using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| any title dollars that the charter school students are eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| to participate in, now have to put that in a written formal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| agreement just to make sure that whatever path that the district chooses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| it just needs to be articulated and in writing. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| department of education is supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| releasing guidance on what that will look like. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| hasn't come out yet, but we're definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| will be on the lookout for that. Any questions about the TESA funding? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| think one other thing I want to mention here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| is that under TESA, and similar to the BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| when students move in and out of charter schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| so if a student enrolls in a charter school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| the charter school will start generating the funding for that student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| upon their enrollment, but if they unenroll and move back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| a traditional Knox County school, the funding will start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| being generated for Knox County at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| You know, there are several counts for student counts throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| that are weighted equally under TESA. Under BEP there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| different weights, but they're now weighted equally, and so then they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| be included in those counts going forward. And that's one thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| that we have heard around how that works when students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| it's very similar to the same way if a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| moves to or out of your district to another district. It's a very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| process. Okay, then quickly walking through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| through the application process. It's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| lengthy process, and it is, you know, a lot of work for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| the applicant and for the district and the district review team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| but the applications, they start, always start at the local level where an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| applicant will submit the application to the local board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| education, and that's through the the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| school sponsor. And so the sponsor is essentially the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| proposed governing body, and the sponsor has to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| non-profit entity, so they cannot be for-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| and they have to have 501c3 status. They cannot be a non-public school or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| post-secondary institution that is not regionally accredited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| and they cannot promote the agenda of any religious denomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| or be religiously affiliated with any religious entity. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| can't be a for-profit entity. I think that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| something unique in Tennessee. A lot of states do allow for-profit charter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| operators. In Tennessee, they do have to be non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| And then the Tennessee Department of Education develops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| and releases the charter school application and the accompanying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| scoring rubric. Districts can ask for additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| information not included in the application, but that has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| submitted to the department and then posted on the department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| website. So you can't ask for additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| information after the application process starts. It has to be before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| process starts. And then prior to the... so all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| applications must be submitted by February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| That date moves depending on if it's to make sure that it falls on a weekday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| And then the letter of intent must be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| 60 days prior to February 1st, again, or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| that date may be. I think this year it's sometime in early December, December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| 4th or 5th. I'm sorry that I can't remember the exact date, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| it is whatever the 60 days is based on the calendar day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| And then once the board receives the application, they must either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| approve or deny the application within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| So if the local board fails to either approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| or deny the application, the application is automatically approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| regardless of the contents of the application. So it's very important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| the board, you know, takes action. I've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| seen a board not vote on an application, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| there are consequences if the board does not act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| And so if after that first 90 days the local board denies an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| the charter sponsor does have 30 days to submit an amended application back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| the school board. And so once that amended application is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| submitted, the school board has another 60 days to either approve or deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| amended application. And similar to the first submission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| cycle, if the board does not either approve or deny, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| automatically, is deemed automatically approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| And then if the school board denies the amended application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| the sponsor then may appeal to the Tennessee Public Charter School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Commission. And so the the Charter School Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| is an independent body that's set up in Tennessee to be an appellate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| authorizer. They have appointed commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| members and an executive director. They're structured similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| to a school board. And once they review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| they can either uphold the denial of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| or they may overturn the denial and deem the application approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| So if the application, if the commission deems an application approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| the school board, the local school board and the charter school may still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| mutually agree that the local school board, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| school will remain part of the district. If this agreement is not met, then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| charter school becomes part of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| LEA. So there, even if the, like I said, the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| denies the application on both submissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| it still can become part of the Knox County school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| or it can become separate and be part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| this commission district. And you know, there are certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| different things to consider when making that decision. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| if a charter school stays in the Knox County school system, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Knox County school system has, you know, the oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| responsibilities for that school. The school board will be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| collect the authorizer fee from that school, which is payment for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| the work that is done by the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| to help accommodate the charter school. So the work that Julie and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Kathy so diligently do for you all. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| the other thing is, is the accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| will remain with Knox County schools. So any accountability results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| of the charter school will be part of the district results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| If the school is under the commission, it's essentially like being in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| different district. It is being in a different district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| There is still some coordination that has to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| with the local school board and the charter commission just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| ensure students are being served, especially if they stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| in the school district. You know, these are still Knox County school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| and so there's still the responsibility of the district. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| once they move over, again, some coordination, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| they're really part of a different district at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| So, you know, I think for most communities it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| really great if it makes sense for the school to remain part of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| It just ensures better collaboration, better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| coordination. Again, these are students that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| cares about and wants to ensure are served very well. So it's always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| to the benefit when the district and the school can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| work collaboratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| Okay, so the application review. This is the hard work, and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| work that thankfully I don't have to do because this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| very, very important and difficult work. So when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| application process begins with assembling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| a review team. So when you're thinking about putting a review team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| together, you want it to be a diverse set of individuals with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| various backgrounds and expertise. Making sure that you have someone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| you know is really strong in academics, someone really strong in financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| budgets, special education, all of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| that you know go into ensuring that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| school is going to serve kids well. Think about those types of backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| for the review team. Again, the review team, it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| important that the review team and you as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| school board when reviewing the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| are really following the scoring rubric and all the things that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| statute for reasons for approval or denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| There have been instances where school boards, you know, this is a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| sometimes very passionate issue and reasons for denial have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| aligned with the scoring rubric or with the reasons outlined in statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| and the decisions of the school board have been overturned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| because they haven't aligned with those reasons for denial. So very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| that you all are familiar with that and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| making really strong decisions based on on the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| scoring rubric and that you all are taking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| these are the sort of main things that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| really are the most important components that you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| in an application that articulates a really strong mission and vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| that's aligned with all of the components of the application. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| ensuring that there is a cohesive plan throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| application of, you know, if they say their mission is to to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| you know a high percentage of low-income students but then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| in a separate section they provide a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| low percentage of economically disadvantaged students that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| anticipating, well that's a disconnect and so thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| like looking at the components throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| entire entire application. The application should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| really detail how the school plans to improve student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| It should provide strong evidence of community support and need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| and that really should be happening, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| at least potentially even a year before they submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| an application is getting to know families, members of the community, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| school board, getting really familiar with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| community that they're planning to serve. That community engagement really needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| to be deep and thoughtful and not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| that's done, you know, quickly at the last minute. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| always encourage schools to try to, potential schools, to try to build that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| community support very early. The application should present a clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| and realistic picture of how the school expects to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| So again that includes that their their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| makes sense, that they are thinking about all of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| it takes to run a school and that that is clearly detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| And then that they demonstrate capacities to successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| implement the proposed academic and operational goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| So it's, you know, it's easy or not easy but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| easier to to set a goal or to to say we're going to do this but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| it's you've got the applications really need to to demonstrate that they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| how to execute that. And so part of good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| authorizing is also denying weak applications. Applications that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| your review team and you as a board don't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| will serve students well. It is absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| you know, very imperative that those applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| are denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| And so what does ongoing quality authorizing look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| The state board of education is responsible for evaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| all charter school authorizers in the state. So school boards and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| the charter school commission to to ensure that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| upholding their end of the the charter school authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| bargain. And it's meant to be a an informative and helpful process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| to ensure, again, collaboration between the district and the charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| which ultimately leads to, you know, what's best for for kids. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| that's really where their focus is. And these are some of the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| principles from the the National Association of Charter School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| Authorizing that that sort of set a foundation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| what ongoing quality authorizing looks like. And so the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| is the commitment to a really strong application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| process. So again, it's a comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| process that includes clear application guidance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| questions from from you all. It's fair, it's transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| and it's very rigorous. And that only charters that demonstrate that capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| to serve kids well are approved. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| it's very important that weak applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| do not move forward. The second is oversight and evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| Again, so once this school is approved, you all enter into this charter contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| and so you all are then evaluating performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| you're monitoring compliance, you're ensuring that the legally entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| autonomy remains, but that you are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| protecting student rights, that you're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| informing the the schools of their their performance and potential intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| revocation, or renewal decisions that are coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| and then that you provide annual public information reports on the school's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| performance. So again, that's very important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| you all are still engaged in the the performance of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| And then the revocation and renewal decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| It's very, very difficult to close a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Everyone is is keenly aware of that, but part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| the contract, the charter contract, is that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| return for the autonomy there is higher standards of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| So again, a quality authorizer designs and implements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| transparent and rigorous process that looks at the comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| academic, financial, and operational performance of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| to make decisions around renewal and charter revocations. And so again, if a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| school is not meeting the terms of their charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| contract, it really is important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| revocation decisions are made if it gets to that point. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| hopefully it does not get to that point, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| it's a very important component of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| And so that was, again, a very quick slideshow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| I know a lot of really sort of dense information, so I'm happy to take any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| questions that anyone may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm so sorry, I didn't quite catch your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| I'm sorry, Elizabeth Fibash. Okay, Elizabeth, I've got just a few quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| questions. So on the renewal or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| possibly revocation, is there a standard time frame in which that should be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| It's a 10-year charter, so does that happen at the beginning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| the ninth year, or when does that occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| That's a great question. So there is a five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| interim review that is required under statute. And as early as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| the eighth year is when conversations can begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| with the school around what it's looking like for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| renewal prospects. And then in the ninth year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| it is best practice for the authorizer to make that decision in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| ninth year, so that they then have the year for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| transition students. There is a transition process that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| have to take place. It's outlined in state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| and it is, again, it's sort of a joint effort between the district and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| school on what closure looks like, ensuring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| kids are, you know, assigned to new schools, all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| that sort of stuff. So the ninth year is when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| decisions really should be made. Okay, thank you. And then on the, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| federal funds and the distribution, there's several different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| Is it up to the district to decide that approach? Is it kind of top down, like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| dictate how that will happen? So the statute does not clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| We're, again, the Department of Education should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| releasing guidance on that. If I had to guess, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| assume it would be between some sort of mutual agreement between the school and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| the district, but I don't know that for sure. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| language in the statute doesn't specify, like, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| is the decision maker there, but again, hopefully as soon as that guidance comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| out, that will be something that's clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Is it solely the governor's responsibility to appoint commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| to the Tennessee Public School Commission? To the commission, yes, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| now, yes. Okay, and then, sorry, I'm on a rapid fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| here, is the intent that the review team of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| the application will or will not include school board members? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| that's up to the... It's not dictated. It's not dictated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| and I think some school board members have participated in review teams in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| the past. Okay, thank you, and I do have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| for Julie Thompson, but if anybody else has a question for Elizabeth, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| So are there any other questions for Ms. Fabash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| All right, thank you. Thank you so much, appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Ms. Thompson, outside of Knox Prep, I think a lot, most of us have heard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Knox Prep's intention of filing an application. Do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| anticipate any other applications this year for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| charters? I have had one group to reach out to me. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| have a meeting scheduled next week. That's not Knox Prep, somebody other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| than? Okay, so potentially two. Correct. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Ms. Horn. Thank you, Madam Chair. I see that we approved our charter review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| committee in February, and do we need to update that since we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| some folks that are changed? So will we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| that in November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Dr. Eisler. We probably... Thank you, Ms. Horn, Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| We could do that in November. We may need to in December. I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Ms. Thompson has a thought on that. We are in the process of identifying those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| people. Thank you for asking that. We are in the process of identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| people to serve, and I plan to bring that to the December meeting. Okay, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| Thank you, Ms. Thompson. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| So, moving on to our next agenda item, we have the discussion on our new Northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| Sector Elementary School Zone. Dr. Reiswick, would you like to lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| that off? Thank you, Ms. Christy. We are actually, I'm actually going to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| it over to Dr. Adams and his team to kind of walk through our proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| and then I think we captured what the board asked us to do at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| last meeting on some of the additional questions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| rationale, and then potential other alternatives to some things. So I'll turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| that over to Dr. Adams. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| Good evening, Madam Chair. Good evening, Executive Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| We appreciate you giving us the opportunity to share some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| information pertaining to the new Northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Sector Elementary School. Tonight, I will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| Mr. Dillingham, who is my Director of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| share some information. Also, we have Dr. Schaefnacher, who will be the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| principal at the new Northwest Elementary School, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| we have Ms. Chacoman, who is now currently the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| of Hardin Valley Elementary School. So we appreciate you all being here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| sharing some additional information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| Just a quick and a brief overview on my part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| of how we got here, and our objective was to, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| relieve overcrowding in the current schools, and those schools, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| course, are Ball Camp Elementary, Carnes Elementary, and Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Elementary. We also want to be very intentional on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| looking at providing space for future growth, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| not only in the new Northwest Sector Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| but also to address those concerns for future growth in the three existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| elementary schools. This is a quick breakdown of where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| were as far as capacity. Last year's enrollment projections, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| as you can see through the enrollment projections and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| where we are as of September 2022, those projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| were pretty accurate. Some schools, such as Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| Elementary, we were we were pretty spot on, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| others, it was numbers are a little higher, but as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| can see, we're very close as far as those projections. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| some zoning considerations. Of course, we always keep our two objectives to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| forefront of every decision that we make, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| like this analogy that Mr. Dillingham shares with me. It puts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| things in perspective. When you think about a ripple in a pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| from the where that ripple starts and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| goes out, that's what we consider as far as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| elementary school. We look at those areas from the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| and then we move outwards. So proximity was on that list. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| looked at the geography around the area. We looked at roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and infrastructures, and once again, Mr. Dillingham will get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| more depth, and he can answer some questions that you all may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| as far as those roadways. Routes of travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| I know that has been a concern, especially Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| Mr. Dillingham tonight can show you all on a map exactly where those routes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| travel are, and we wanted to preserve the PRZ. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| think that is very important that we look at that and we establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| those PRZ zones. And of course, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| development of a cohesive zone. We want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| want it to make sense. We want to make sure it's a cohesive zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| and population concentrations. We will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| identify those areas for the protection of our students. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| don't want to identify where students are by dots. We could show you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| dots on a map. We will provide that information for our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| if you all want to see exactly the locations of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| But what we can do tonight is Mr. Dillingham can show you concentrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| areas so you have an understanding where students are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Before I pass this on to Mr. Dillingham, I would like to respectfully ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| that you please hold your questions to the end of our presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| and we will certainly be here to the end of the presentation to answer any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| questions you may have. This is the proposed zone and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| this is actually a zoomed in zone with more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| I will pass it off to Mr. Dillingham at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you, Dr. Adams. Thank you, Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| and members of the board. Let me wrestle with some technology real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Okay, so this, as Dr. Adams just alluded to, is a detail of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| our zone map. So kind of what I wanted to start out with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| is how we built a school zone and some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| considerations we went through, what our thought processes were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| how we ended up with this yellow area on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| So the, I guess, there's not a, we look at lots of things and there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| not a, I don't think of them as a hierarchy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| it is sort of a, there are a number of factors that have to be taken into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| account whenever you're making a decision of this magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| So there is not like one reason we do this, there are many reasons that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| this. There is not one thing that we take into account, there are many things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| we take into account. So going back to the list on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| previous slide that Dr. Adams read, proximity. So our little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| red star right here, that's our school site. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| was where we began with everything and we started essentially working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| outward from there. The logic being that people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| closer to the new school should more likely or more logically go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| to that school. Obviously once you start getting further and further away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| that breaks down a little bit, but it is one of the things that we took into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| account. Second, geography and topography of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| area. I mean y'all can see the river, Beaver Creek comes through here, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| is a ridge line that, Beaver Ridge actually comes all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| way through here and comes down south of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Road. So that is, as anybody who's lived in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| East Tennessee for any length of time knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| we got a whole lot of ridges, we have a whole lot of valleys. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Hardin Valley is no exception to that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| It does not, you know, we're not, I'm not taking buses off-road, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| the fact that there's a ridge there doesn't in and of itself mean anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| but what it does express itself as, where the roads are. And so often, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| know, roads, it is easier to build in a valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| than it is on the side of a hill, so you'll get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| that's why Hardin Valley is located where it is, etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| So it plays in overt and sort of more covert ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| Additionally, the roadways, infrastructure, and routes of travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| So obviously, Pellissippi Parkway, Oak Ridge Highway, Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2334)|
| 0:39:03| let me make sure, yeah, these are, they all present barriers, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2343)|
| 0:39:11| arteries. So we're not going to use Pellissippi, I've said that over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| we're not going to use that to get kids to and from. We are going to use lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| other roads to get kids to and from, though. That is a thing that we take into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| account. The hat that I wear most of the time is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| school buses, and so that is something that is in forefront of my mind when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| we're looking at things like this. What is the infrastructure? What can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| support? How can we get from here to there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| That's actually a question that we ask lots of places. If I have a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| if I live right here, and I'm going to go to the new school, how do I get from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| here to there? If I'm going to put in a bus stop to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| serve this house right there, how do I get from here to there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| What does that time look like? What does the traffic volumes look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| What do we expect to see? Like, what are we going to, I mean, we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| it's easy to talk about bus routes in particular, and abstractions, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| every single one of these is a vehicle with, you know, our most precious cargo on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| it. So what does that look like for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| What does the beginning of their day look like? What does the end of their day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| look like? We also, Dr. Adams mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| preserving the PRZ of existing schools. That mainly came into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| on the west side of the zone. As you all can see, we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| this is Carnes Elementary, this is Ball Camp Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| We, some of the zone lines encroach pretty close over here, particularly in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Ball Camp. So that is a, you know, that has just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| been a best practice of Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| throughout rezonings for the last, as long as I've worked here. The PRZ is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| held sacrosanct. So those things were, required us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| a little bit of adjusting in these areas to make sure that we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| you know, accomplishing the goals we needed to accomplish while not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| infringing more than we needed to on those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Development of a cohesive zone. One thing we try to stay away from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| if at all possible, is, I've always heard it termed as finger annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| So, you know, you take a little strip right here or a little strip up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| and it's just, it is out on an island all by itself. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| try to stay away from stuff like that so you're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| areas rather than just discrete sections. You can't always do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| just because of some of the other factors that I've listed here today, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| as a guiding principle that's what we try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| And the other thing we look at is population concentrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| So I have a map that has dots on it for my personal reference. So just speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| in general terms, there are a lot of people that live right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| here. There are a lot of people that live right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| There are a lot of people that live right here, down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| in this corridor here, and over close to Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| So we look at those things because, I mean, the driver of this entire process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| is the fact that there are too many kids in Hardin Valley Elementary School. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| designed a zone that does not pull a sufficient number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| of students out of Hardin Valley, out of Carnes, out of Ball Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| then I've not designed a very good zone. And so there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| a, again, there is not one thing that pushes this process more than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| There are lots of things that we take into account and there are oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| these things are inversely proportional. One gives and the other takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| And so we have to try to weigh all of these factors and come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| a balanced approach. So the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| absolutely was a thing that we looked at, where those people are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| where those people are now, where they might be in the future, where we expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| kids to come from. One of the things that was mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| in the meeting last month was specifically about the Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| Road corridor and why we stayed mostly north of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| and not as much south of it. To a large extent, the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| on the south end of Hardin Valley Road is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| There's an apartment complex right here. There's 22 kids that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| live in that apartment complex right now, but that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| the exception right now as opposed to the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| Additionally, the extension of Beaver Ridge that I mentioned earlier comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| through right here, parallels Hardin Valley Road. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| the properties that they have there, like I looked at the owners, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| there's the Methodist Church owns some property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| here, TVA Credit Union owns some property there, but all that stuff backs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| up to the ridge. So it has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| developed to this point and it does not look as if the opportunities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| development in the future are as attractive there as they are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| other parts of the zone. So that's one of the reasons we kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| stayed away from down here, is there's just not that many people and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| expect there to be that many people going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| All right, so this is the proposed zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| So this is the same table we've looked at before. So it has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| proposed, the changes to the various schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| the starting total for the new elementary school. I did want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| highlight that the proposal that we have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| suggests the grandfather transfer for all rising fifth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| So none of these numbers, all of these numbers assume that nobody grandfathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| So there are a hundred students that will qualify to grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Those hundred students are not accounted for at any point in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| table. The logic behind that is essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| if your family gets rezoned, the decision whether you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| access your grandfather transfer or not is going to be an individual family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| decision. I can't predict what people are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| do, nor do I want to. So there is going to be a little bit of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| you know, there's going to be some flexibility in these numbers because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| people do have autonomy in what they're going to do and how they're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| and what their family situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| All right, at this point I'd like to introduce Dr. Schaefnacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| Good evening Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| We thought that it was very important to kind of explain and paint a picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| of what Hardin Valley looks like right now. And we keep saying it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| overcrowded, but what does that currently look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| and feel like as a student of Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| So currently, starting at the top, this proposed zone, it creates the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| potential opportunity for growth at all four of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| Currently at Hardin Valley, you're looking at gaining four to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| classrooms and that's empty classrooms. And again, this is just for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| At Carnes Elementary, seven to eight classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| Ball Camp, a possibility of one to two classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| And then of course at the new school, it's going to be able to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| the additional 565 students. But what does that look like at Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| We keep saying that it's overcrowded. So before I go down this laundry list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| of things that are going on in that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| I think it's important to note that there are seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| learning cottages, also known as portables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| located on this property. And this plan does not relieve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| Those are supposed to be temporary classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| and they are considered not so temporary because they do have to remain on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| property. So with those remaining at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| they currently have three double classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| and those will return to a single classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| You're probably thinking, what's a double classroom? So a double classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| is basically, for instance, what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| considered a music room. It is, I would say, 40 to 50 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| I'm looking over at Lynn Jacomen just to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| And it's two teachers so that we are maintaining that BEP ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| But you've basically got 40 to 50 students in one room with two teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| So those classrooms would return to a single classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| You also have four encore teachers who are either on carts or they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| displaced. So they don't currently have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| area and so they need their own classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Also, the building was built with three work rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Two of those, while I was there, we converted those two classrooms into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| a technology encore classroom. So those need to be reverted back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| their original use. This also gives a classroom to ELL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| and GT. And it also gives four additional classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| for on-site SPED services. So that's a whole laundry list, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| think it's important, and you can see in the fine print at the bottom of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| that this does not provide additional space for the SRO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| the social worker, the psychologist, the counselors that are there, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| tutors. All of these people that I have just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| listed off share a space. And so it's very hard for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| them to conduct business in a confidential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| manner. So those spaces don't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| classrooms, but they certainly require offices or smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| areas within the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2893)|
| 0:48:25| Okay, so now we were asked to look at some alternatives to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| zone that was proposed. So just at a very high level, and I'll go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| through this a little bit more detailed in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| but alternative one would be the removal of the Hayden Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| subdivision for our development from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| new school zone. The second one would be the expansion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| the grandfather clause, and the third would be an expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| of the proposed school zone for the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| So alternative one, removing Hayden Hills from the new school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| So what that would look like is we have 44 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| right now in Hayden Hills that are attending Hardin Valley Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| School. That number could grow in future years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| as we've talked about previously. The neighborhood is not quite done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| It's pretty close, but it's not quite done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| One thing that is difficult when we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| things at this granular of a level is that, you know, we've referenced our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| projections throughout this process. So the projections are meant to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| district level, a school level aid. So when you are looking at projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| on the level of a neighborhood, it starts to break down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| Anybody that's familiar with statistics will tell you that a larger sample size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| is better than a smaller sample size. When you're looking at something, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| mean Hayden Hills is a sizable development, you know, there's 250 odd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| individual plots in there, but 250, if you have one person that moves in with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| large family, or one person moves in with a small family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| that creates a statistically significant difference in what you could see with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| number of students that come out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| So the projections are still worthwhile, they're still worthy, they're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| sound, but when we're using them to get to the number of Hayden Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| specifically, we're using them in a way that they're not designed to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| Having said all of that, we do project that Hayden Hills would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| stabilize with between 45 and 50 elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| students coming out of that development in coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| years. So to contextualize that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| further, that's approximately 10 percent of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| that we were hoping, that we were proposing to zone out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| of Hardin Valley Elementary School, staying in Hardin Valley Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| School. The other part I feel incumbent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| upon me to mention is if we start making neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| level decisions about school zones, we're setting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| precedent for every time that we go through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| about how we're going to approach this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| All right, so this is our same trustee enrollment chart, but with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| those numbers edited. So as you'll notice, the bright red parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| those are what is changing. So here we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| fewer students coming out of Hardin Valley Elementary, fewer students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| going to the new elementary school, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| updated totals across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| All right, alternative number two was expanding the grandfather clause to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| include all currently enrolled younger siblings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| of rising fifth graders. So the current proposal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| only rising fifth graders would be able to grandfather, their siblings would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| So there are 100 rising fifth graders across the three affected schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| Those 100 students have 39 younger siblings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| So again, trying to contextualize this a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| that's five percent of the projected, roughly five percent of the projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| opening enrollment of the new elementary school. One other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| thing that I think is important to know, that number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| 39 younger siblings, that is 39 kids that are currently enrolled in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| Schools. So it does not include anyone, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| under the age of five, for example, or who might attend a private school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| parochial school, etc. We don't have a way of capturing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| So it's a, this is everyone that we know about. This would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| sort of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| And this is, again, our same trusty chart, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| updated to reflect the, I guess, adjusted populations, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| lack of a better term. And you can see the breakdown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| There are four younger siblings at Ball Camp, 26 younger siblings at Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| Valley Elementary, nine younger siblings of Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Elementary, for a total of 39. And, of course, here would be the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| totals for the school at that point. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| The third alternative is actually an expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| of the proposed school zone. And the, I guess, the purpose of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| the fear that not enough students are coming out of Hardin Valley Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| School to accommodate for the amount of growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| that we're seeing in that sector of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| So the idea behind this is, you know, we rezone more of those students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| to the new elementary school and thus create more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| space at Hardin Valley Elementary for that additional growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| Okay. So there are not road names on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| So to provide some context, this is Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| This is Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| This is Snyder Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| And this is Yarnell. This is Carmichael Road leading up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| Pellissippi. So if anybody, like, landmarks, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| gas station, like, I think it's a Weigel's. It's right here. There's some apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| this is a big apartment complex right there on the left as you're going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| toward Pellissippi. So the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| I guess, the reason that this area, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| we selected this area is, so this is an area that developed before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| the bulk of Hardin Valley did. So a lot of these homes have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| were sold 10-12 years ago. The neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| in the area that I've highlighted here in red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| are mostly built out. There's some apartment complexes, but these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| mature areas for lack of a better term. I don't expect there to be a whole lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| development. I don't expect there to be a whole lot of additional growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| The student yield that we will probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| realize out of these areas is going to be relatively stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| So that's both good and bad. It does not help us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| conversations about coming years, but it does provide immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| immediate relief for Hardin Valley Elementary School and, again, creates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| additional seats for developments that may occur in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| areas of their zone for the, for kids that come out of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| to take that place. So I mentioned, I, you know, keep coming back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| ridgeline. So the ridgeline comes right through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Carmichael Road, right here, kind of runs in a shoulder of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| ridgeline. So it's going, the high point is essentially here, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| running downhill toward Lovell Road. So Carmichael kind of runs in the shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| of that. There's an apartment complex here. I think it's the icon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| at Hardin Valley, if memory serves. There's another apartment complex here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| The name escapes me. We've not seen, those are fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| finished. There's a third phase of the icon that could go in this weird little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| piece of land right there. We're not seeing a ton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| of students coming out of there right now. There's four here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| 13 here. So those numbers could increase a little bit, but we're not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| they're going to build new buildings and all of a sudden we have 50 new kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| So this is also, again, we're talking ridgelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| If that area develops, I guess the economics of the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| to my limited understanding, again, being the guy that does buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| it's cheaper to build on flatland than it is on the side of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| This is the side of a hill. So this may develop, but it's going to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| after other cheaper stuff has already developed. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| the economics of this situation dictate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| maybe people would be willing to spend the extra money to put stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| here, but that's not something that I personally think is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| happen sooner. There are other areas that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| more ripe for development prior to that. So this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| it's essentially, this is an area that is sort of stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| and we can, you know, if our concern is getting more students out of Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Valley, this is an area where we can go and get a relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| stable number of students out of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| There, pardon me, right now this neighborhood down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| their distance to Hardin Valley Elementary going this direction is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| three and a half miles. So this same neighborhood going to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| new elementary school would be approximately four and a half miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| The main route of travel that I would anticipate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| people living down in this area in order to access the new elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| would be taking Snyder or Yarnell down to Lovell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| turning left, pardon me, going underneath Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| turning left on Schaefer Road. They would then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| follow Schaefer, it parallels Pellissippi Parkway. Up just past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| Harrison Springs, Schaefer's actually been redone, like there are sidewalks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| it's nice wide lanes. It's been realigned to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| to Cherahala Boulevard right here at Hardin Valley Road. So people will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| up this way, go to that stoplight, and then go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| across Hardin Valley Road in order to go up Cherahala to Coward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| Mill and the new school. And that is a route of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| travel that buses could follow, cars could follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| I think it's the most logical way for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| Oh, I bet this is stuff that I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| Sorry. Yeah, it is. Okay. So I guess the only other point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| that I should mention is that the other thing that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| alternative does do is it expands the, like our conversations up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| have been, you know, kind of all centered around one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| our yellow zone, that one area of town. We are now expanding that footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| And so we are talking about neighborhoods, families, students that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| have not previously been a part of this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| now will be. So I think that is worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| consideration as well. And then here's our table again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| illustrating what the enrollment of the various schools would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| under alternative three. The biggest change, of course, is to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| So they would lose approximately 630 students, leaving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| with 777 enrolled in August of 23. And we would open the new elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| with 865 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| And now I get to hand it off to Sunny again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| It's the last one, I promise. So we basically are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| hoping that a decision can be made at the next board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Because if we can go ahead and agree on a zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| then we can move forward with several different things. However, if a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| is not made, it does impact and slow some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| down to start the new school. So for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| we've got to name the new school, which I know that sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| kind of, for lack of better words, silly. But that name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| impacts almost everything. It impacts budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| It impacts getting a tax ID number where we can purchase things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| There's lead time on different furniture pieces and equipment that we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| ordering right now. And we can't do that until we get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| name of the school and the tax ID number. Also, we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| select the mascot. And I would love to have student input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| on this. And we can go ahead and get a mascot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| and a name for the school without zoning it. But I really think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| important to have that student input piece and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| parent input piece. And then this also impacts the staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| allocation. Because those are already in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| of determining, basically for all schools, who needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| add teachers, who may need to downsize a little bit with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| And so not only does it impact me and the new school, it impacts the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| three schools. So it's impacting four schools'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| staffing allocations. And like I mentioned earlier, the budgeting piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| Like we need to go ahead and start purchasing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| And we can't until this is completed. So just begging for a decision to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| Thank you. And now questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3657)|
| 1:01:06| All right. Thank you, Dr. Adams and Ms. Schaffenhocker and Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| Do we have any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for this presentation. I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| appreciated being able to see where the students were located. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| that helped me to see that what we're looking at, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| where Pellissippi is, is really about the same, roughly, number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| of students going back and forth. So where we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| these students going across to go to Hardin Valley, we now have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| about the same number going the other direction. So that helped me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| understand that quite a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| Just as something to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| I'd like us to consider, instead of playing with all of this different data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| that could change, it might be easier to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| grandfather the fifth graders like we've planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| keep the zone like we've planned, and then give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| all the current Hardin Valley elementary students first priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| on transfer requests to stay there. And also first priority on transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| requests to go to the new school. So that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| might help to even that out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| And then once we got to capacity, that would just stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| So that might be something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| Instead of changing all the zones and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| kind of hoping, if we gave them first priority on transfer requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| then we could grant those until space ran out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| And that might help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| Do you know how many students currently are bussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| or like the percentage that either take a bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| or are car riders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| And I don't know, you know, we had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| Not a lot of students access transportation in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| Percentage-wise, I don't have that percentage, but I know not a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| students access transportation at all in that area. So if we had more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| students who were accessing transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| that would take care of. It would significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| reduce the amount of traffic on that in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| Okay, thank you. And while I'm on that, I'd also like to throw a little plug out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| for, I'd really like to see us get rid of the PRZs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| and allow busing for all of our students. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Dr. Adams, I want to ask a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| questions about the third alternative. So I do think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| going to have a challenge long term in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| if we only reduce the current population. I think the proposed new zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| is reducing it by 200 kids. Is that right? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| Let's see. I got so many different tables here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| Yeah, so it's 1,400 kids now. Its capacity is 1,200, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| getting it down to somewhere around 900 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| And I think we're going to have challenges long term with more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| development in that area. So I appreciate the third alternative. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| curious what caused you all to bring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| tonight. I think it ends up actually helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| some of the long-term growth issues in Hardin Valley, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| I'm curious why you all, what caused you not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| bring forth that proposal in the original? I'm just trying to get a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| of what was the... Thank you, Mr. Watson. That was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| request directly from the board. Okay, so there was some board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| members you were asking for. Yes, that is correct. So we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| We are proposing our first proposal. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| The three alternative proposals that you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| we're at a direct request from the board. Okay, that's helpful. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| you all, based on the projections that you all have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| you all think that the first proposal addresses the longer term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| concerns with potential development and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| expanded zone is not necessarily, it's not necessary in your all's minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| even for the long-term projections. Is that? Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| Yeah, okay. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, one other question. I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| heard this before that our precedent in terms around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| grandfathering is typically fifth grade or eighth grade depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| on the school, right, if it's a middle school zone or if it's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| elementary school zone. So our precedent has not been to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| grandfathering kids of those particular grade levels, right, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| alternative to here. That's not been our precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| in the past. That is correct. The most recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| grandfathering we have done with the new schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| that the precedent was to have that terminal grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| and yes, to your point, no, not look at the siblings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| Yeah, and I, Mr. Deliano, I appreciate you mentioning several times. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| whatever decision we do end up making is there's going to be precedent set for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| whatever the next decision is, right, and so I think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| make sure that whatever decision that we make that we take that into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| and I also think that provides more consistency to the community as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| that they kind of get a sense of what those precedents are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| going into it. Anyway, thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=3998)|
| 1:06:47| So do we have any other questions? Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| Thank you, Madam Chair. Just a question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| Ms. Owens' thought about the transfer. I would assume that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| may not be very many spots for a transfer because this school is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| essentially still going to be at capacity even if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| rezone all these students. So is it correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| am I thinking about it correctly that if we had a third grader that wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| transfer into that school, it would only be if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| you happen to have 19 kids in a 20 classroom space. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4041)|
| 1:07:28| Because we're essentially still going to be at capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| Yes, that's a great question and then you get into the grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| conversation when you have some classes that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| just larger than others. So the building level principal would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| then have to take in consideration that grade level and it may be that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| school can hold additional students but that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| grade level they cannot because they're already at capacity for that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| grade. And so you get into the classes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| some classes are larger than others. It would just be a very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| situation at that point but I just I guess I don't want to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| false hope that there could be opportunity for transfer because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| there may not be. That is correct and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| you know every transfer regardless who applies or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| gets a preference, it's on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| Okay, thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| Mr. Watts. Thank you Madam Chair. So I know it wasn't drawn that way on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| map but I want to make sure that I'm right. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| we do alternative one and remove Hayden Hills, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| basically creating a donut in the zone, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| So there'd be a kind of an empty spot in the zone that the zone would wrap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| around that particular neighborhood. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| Yes, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| yeah so this is Hayden Hills right here. And so if we just remove Hayden Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| you'll have the south side of Sanley Road that will stay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| Hardin Valley. The north side of Sanley Road will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| to the new elementary school. So it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| yeah it'll create a I call it a bulge. Okay, a bulge. Thank you. I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| description. And then the the alternative three really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| creates something you said that the in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| historically we've tried to fight against which is kind of finger zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| right that that alternative three is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| like this just kind of random jut off off the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| that I know I've seen that in the past and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| typically families who live long term in those finger zones don't appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| being in the finger zones from what I've seen. But anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| And Mr. Watson to your point this is probably one of the cleanest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| rezonings I have seen to where you're not cutting across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| a street. So it when you look at it on a map it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| You're not cutting into neighborhoods basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4200)|
| 1:10:08| Ms. Henderson. I just had some comments. I just want to thank you for taking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| time during this workshop to present these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| ideas. I know we heard from a lot of a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| folks in the Herndon Valley community. So thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| you know listening to us listening to their voices. And I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| I appreciate Ms. Owen coming up with that plan. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| I think it's a good idea. I think it gives people some choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| that are asking for choice. So I appreciate you Ms. Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| and coming up with that idea as well. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| Thank you Ms. Henderson. Okay yeah and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| just like to add with with the growth in this area and I'm assuming that at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| point you know we might have to come back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| revisit zoning again eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| So I just to note because I think we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| a lot of people say I bought my home thinking I would go to this school or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| that school and with so much growth in this area we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| we can't really guarantee that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| You know we're seeing the effects of it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| Herndon Valley Elementary right now. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| do want to note that it's like nobody feels good about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| you know rezoning but you know and they are hard hard decisions and I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| appreciate the work and I definitely like your suggestion as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| well Ms. Owen. But just just to note that we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| have to revisit this and if you're in that area buying a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| thinking you're going to a certain school that might not always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| be the case. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| Ms. Horn. Thank you. Ms. Owen can I ask a clarifying question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| Was your intent that if a student asked for a transfer that they would be given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| priority over a student that did not live in that that zip code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| Yes. Okay. I was thinking that might give us a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| a little more control of the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| than just blanket grandfathering. And then they would also have a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| opportunity versus somebody that lives in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| South Knoxville or whatever. Right. Also okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| Okay. Thank you. Mr. McMillan. Thank you Madam Chair. In reference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| what you were the comments you made and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| commented Mr. Watson made about establishing precedent. I do think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4360)|
| 1:12:47| area will continue to grow and we will probably have to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| again. However| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| in establishing precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| once we establish a zone that that doesn't mean that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| fixed in stone. Because some of us will not be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| maybe in the future when when that was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| and I mean when it would come up rather. But anytime you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4398)|
| 1:13:26| majority of the board they can restructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| however they choose to do so if they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| the votes. Just I just want to point that out. It may be unlikely but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| Thank you Mr. McMillan. Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Just on one other clarifying question. How long would you intend that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| preference be in existence? Is that just this next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| calendar year when the school opens? Is it ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| What's your thought about that? Since it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| based on transfer rather than grandfathering I would think it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| it could be for all the students who are currently there as long as they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| I mean it's it's all space dependent. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| I guess what I'm asking is if somebody let's say five years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4457)|
| 1:14:24| says hey I want to all of a sudden I want to transfer there. Would they still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| get the same precedence because they were in that same first priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| Yeah. I would say not based on zip code. I would say based on students who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| there right now. Right. Okay. So the priority based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| zip code would be shorter lived. Right. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| And I might add just just for fun that that I went through something similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| to this when I was in fifth grade but they sent us back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| they moved us because one school was overcrowded. They built on and then sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| us back in the middle of our fifth grade year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| I barely remember it. I turned out mostly okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| Okay. Thank you Ms. Owen. So do we have any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| discussion, comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| Okay. So thank you Dr. Adams. Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| Executive Board. We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| So Ms. Henderson we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| Thank you Madam Chair. We do have three public forum speakers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| First we have Mr. Timothy Buss. Mr. Timothy Buss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| Hello sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4544)|
| 1:15:52| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| Okay. Thank you sir. Next we have Mr. Nathaniel Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| If you want to come up and just state your name, county of residence and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| Hi. Good evening. Thank you for your time this afternoon, this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| So I represent the Greenbrook HOA. We sent in a petition with over 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| signatures, numerous letters and also been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| contact with other neighborhoods in the western side of the Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| affected area. So we've been a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| disappointed with this whole process. We thought it'd be more interactive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| start with. It doesn't seem like there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| input from the community that was taken into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| The other thing that was told to us is that, and I don't really understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| this is the case, is that the schools do not interact with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| highway department in planning these types of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| That's kind of, I don't really understand why we're not using all these resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| together. So based on what our conversations have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| been with the other neighborhoods, we recommend at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| that you do not adopt the current proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| based on the fact that we've never been explained how we're supposed to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| there in the mornings. There's a choke point underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| the Pellissippi Parkway at Old Solway and Hardin Valley where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| everybody from that side is going to have to turn left. There's no other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| to get there and that already is backed up in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| mornings before we do this and none of those people go that way right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| So as it is right now, none of us are sure how we're going to get there in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| mornings. The reason no one uses the transportation in the morning is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| the time of pickup, nobody's kids want to be out there before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| 740, I mean 640. This will just be even worse because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| drive time will obviously be longer. So at this point we're asking that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| don't accept that proposal. The other thing that I've heard from all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| of these neighborhoods that I've been talking with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| is the special attention to one neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| That neighborhood actually happens to be the closest to the new school as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| So they would actually have the shortest drive as well. So we would also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| ask that you don't give any special consideration to any neighborhood. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| the other neighborhoods have their reasons why they chose to live where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| they are. They like the schools they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| They have all the same reasons and so that's what I'd like you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| Next we have Miss Whitney Miller. Whitney Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| Oh did she leave? Oh okay. That concludes public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Madam Chair. So moving on to board forum. Miss Deckard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4706)|
| 1:18:34| Miss Owen. Mr. Watson. Miss Henderson. Miss Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| Miss Horn. Mr. Triplett. Mr. McMill. All right so with that meeting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4721)|
| 1:18:48| adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-4178-221026?start=4728)|
