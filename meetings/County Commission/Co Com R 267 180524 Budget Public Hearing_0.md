| 0:01:01| This is a chance for the public to give their input into our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| And I'm glad for anybody that's participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| We are always welcome to hear from our citizens to get their inputs and thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| We will go to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| The first name I have on the list is Vivian Sypes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| Sypes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Sypes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| I don't see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| Turn it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Okay, I'll come back to her after we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Curwin Fritz. Hello, ma'am. How are you? Good. If you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=88)|
| 0:01:41| You have up to five minutes. Okay. Thank you. My name is Curwin Fritz and my address is 132, is that what you said, address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=101)|
| 0:01:49| Londonderry Road, 37923. Okay. My daughter is a magnet transfer student at Green Magnet Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=109)|
| 0:01:59| Over the past month or so, we have heard from the superintendent and the school board about standards, assessments, proficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| and accountability as they relate to our students and our children's schools, especially with regards to our children and schools located in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| But my question is, who holds the superintendent and the school board accountable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| What standards should be used by parents, students, and concerned community members to measure the Board of Education's level of proficiency on behalf of our children's education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=136)|
| 0:02:25| We need standards and accountability to prevent what happened this year with the budget from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| Let me start by mentioning two actions involving the Civil Rights, the Office of Civil Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| The rezoning debates of 1989 and 91 that stem from an effort to achieve racial balance in our schools and the creation of magnet schools in 1991 is part of a plan to desegregate the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=156)|
| 0:02:47| With the building of two new middle schools, one in Gibbs and one in Hardin Valley, questions arose regarding rezoning for these schools and how rezoning would affect the Office of Civil Rights complaint regarding desegregation in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| In response, then Interim Superintendent Buzz Thomas conducted six public meetings across the county over the course of ten weeks to hear parent and community concerns and suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=174)|
| 0:03:12| Interim Superintendent Buzz Thomas set the standard, and the standard is when a school superintendent is faced with a situation that might roll back civil rights protections established by the OCR, the superintendent must be able to provide the necessary support to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=192)|
| 0:03:23| The superintendent needs to be aware of the civil rights action and hold public forums well in advance of the school board vote in order to hear community concerns and suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=203)|
| 0:03:32| However, when it came to the Office of Civil Rights action regarding the creation of magnet schools, Superintendent Bob Thomas failed to meet that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| When he was creating the 2018-19 budget that eliminated two magnet schools and cut funding to the rest, instead of giving at least ten weeks' notice and holding six public forums for parents, students, and concerned citizens, he offered no public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=220)|
| 0:03:54| He gave those of us who found out on Thursday, April 5th, a mere six-day notice before the school board vote on the budget and an even shorter three-day notice before the work session. Some parents, administrators, and community members had even less notice than we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=234)|
| 0:04:08| With regards to the school board, first of all, I would like to thank the three school board members who stood up for what was right and made an effort to fully fund the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| With regards to the school board standard to which it should be held accountable, the school board has already created its own standard in the form of a mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| The Knox County Board of Education's mission is to advocate excellence for all children by serving Knox County as a governing body for public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=264)|
| 0:04:33| Excellence for all children means excellence for all children. It does not mean excellence for all children in my district and only in my district or in my district and my friend's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=273)|
| 0:04:45| It means excellence for all children, including children in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| The superintendent and school board have not been advocating excellence for all children when it comes to District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| They have been responsible for eliminating 12 teaching positions at Austin East High School, taking funds from unauthorized educational opportunities meant for Austin East students, and using them to pay for the $450,000 unauthorized culinary arts classroom in a West Knox County high school, and defunding magnet schools and magnet school programs, as well as eliminating magnet programs at Green Magnet Academy and Sarah Moore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=298)|
| 0:05:21| Most of the schools affected by these devastating cuts are located in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| By voting in favor of the superintendent's budget, both the school board and the superintendent fail to meet its own standard of excellence for all children and need to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=327)|
| 0:05:38| Every future decision the superintendent and school board makes needs to be held up against their mission statement to advocate excellence for all children, and we parents, students, school administrators, and staff, and community members need to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=338)|
| 0:05:51| When the Board of Education submits its required quarterly expenditure reports, we need you to verify that the BOE is continuing to use its funding to support education for all students in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=351)|
| 0:06:22| We also request that you audit those accounts quarterly, or at any time it might appear the BOE is misusing funds, to ensure the BOE is not using any of the public school funds to the benefit of one group of students and to the detriment of another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=382)|
| 0:06:37| While your authority over the school budget may be limited, we need you to advocate excellence for all children where you can, because our superintendent and school board have proven they are not proficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=403)|
| 0:07:14| Is there anyone else that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| Okay, Mr. Shouse is going to be out of town next week when we have our workshop, so if anybody has any questions for Mr. Shouse, he's here to take those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| Ed Shouse, Knox County Trustee, 1301 Wilshire Road, and if there are questions I don't have the answer to, I can, I'll have the answer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=447)|
| 0:07:57| I'll have the answer for you by next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=477)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=507)|
| 0:08:58| You were in attendance at the Audit Committee meeting the other day, and I meant to recognize you, and you left us before I thought of it a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=538)|
| 0:09:07| I know that he is diligently working toward reducing the cost of the operation that he's involved in, as he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=547)|
| 0:09:18| But the other thing that I want to make notice of is that they are also working on sale of delinquent tax products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=558)|
| 0:09:28| And since he, being in office, they had more tax sales in the last couple of three years than we had in Knox County for all the time I've been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=568)|
| 0:09:42| So bringing that to a forefront and having, I hate to say it this way, but have property owners pay their way, I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| and look forward to the improvements in the office that you're bringing to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=589)|
| 0:09:59| Thank you. Thank you for those kind remarks, Commissioner, and I appreciate your attendance at those tax sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| The more bidders we have out there bidding the prices up, the better it is for Knox County, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| So maybe we can get, I'll make sure all these other guys are invited when we have the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| Maybe we'll get them involved and interested in purchasing some real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| Anything else, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Thank you, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Yeah, can we talk about the $33 million bond issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| Is that for this coming up budget or the one we're in, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| The $38 million that was on the agenda for Monday would be for the current fiscal year of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| Okay. We'll go through that. I'll go through it over again. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| Okay, I guess we're just going to stand here and sit here a little while because I do not want to adjourn this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| and then somebody show up late that wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| I'll dance for you if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| You'll dance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Just talking to Ed Schaus for a second. He was up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| And so just so you know about what they've done, in their fiscal year 2018, which is current year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| they had a budget and their excess fees of $6.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| They've actually collected to date and turned over to us already $6.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| And their budget for 2019 is $6.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| So he brought up excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I just wanted to talk about that just to give you an idea of where we are currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| He's already turned in more this year than was budgeted, and so he runs a very efficient office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| Yes, he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| I'll acknowledge that Mayor Burchett is here in the back and so is Councilwoman Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=704)|
| 0:11:53| Mr. Chairman, Ms. Scheib is not going to be able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| I just sent her a message and she's still at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| So you can be the first one on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| I've got one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Who was the other name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Sheena Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:20| Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| If you have anything that you want to ask us, we're happy to answer while you wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=748)|
| 0:12:51| Doing a little overview for the public over the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=771)|
| 0:13:03| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Chris, do you want to just give us a quick overview of the budget again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| Try to kill three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:38| The budget for 2019 for the total county is an increase of $20,887,355 more over and above the budget for 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=818)|
| 0:13:55| This can be found on page eight of the proposed budget book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=835)|
| 0:14:05| Of that amount, right at $5.3 million is increased in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| General purpose school fund, of course, is increased by a little over $13.3 million, almost $13.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| Our special revenue funds don't have a lot of change in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| A $4,400 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Public libraries, an increase of $450,000, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| The biggest increase is in engineering and public works of $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| What that would be in reference to would be the increase of the gasoline tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| In this budget, we have put that mainly into the use of resurfacing roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:55| The penny on the tax rate, which the tax rate is $2.12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| The penny on the tax rate for FY19 is predicted to be $1,247,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=899)|
| 0:15:10| That's what makes our property tax up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| We can get into how that is spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| But the total operating budget is $819,052,457.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=915)|
| 0:15:24| I had made some notes getting into revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=924)|
| 0:15:37| That is proposed budget of $264.3 million total that we expect to get in for FY19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=937)|
| 0:15:54| You can compare that back to the number when Mayor Brad Richard took over, and that was about $230.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=954)|
| 0:16:03| So we have saw growth in our tax base of $34 million approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| Sales tax, we are projecting this year to be about $163.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| Once again, you compare that back to when the mayor took office, and his first budget had a budget of $139.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=976)|
| 0:16:27| So that's a healthy increase there in sales tax as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| And, of course, people talk about will tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| That is budgeted at $13.6 million for FY19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| The other big revenue source that we have is BEP, and that's a little over $218 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| So that makes up the big revenue sources that the county sees that we do get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| We do have in this budget a little planned use of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1014)|
| 0:17:13| That number for the general fund is $1.58 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| That's planned use of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| If you ask me, do I think we'll use that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Historically, the answer would be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| We budget very conservatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| And so by doing that, we budget 100% for expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| and knowing that we'll probably spend about 98% of expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| And we're very conservative on our revenue estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| And so I don't believe that you will see that number used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| As like with FY18, we had a planned use of fund balance of $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| I think we'll actually have a budget surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| which means that we won't use any of that and actually have a budget surplus, which is a positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Public library proposed use of fund balance is about $160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| Historically, they don't use what we propose there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| Solid waste, about $168,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| Use of fund balance, they actually may use theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| That's a fund that is heavily driven by the cost of commodities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| And we have saw that number rise and fall, and as it does, it has an impact on that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| Engineering and Public Works have planned use of $149,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| If they continue to see the increase in gas tax and sales tax, they will not use that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| Debt service is a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| You'll see planned use of debt service fund balance of $7.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| That's assuming that interest rates or variable rate bonds hit 4.5% or 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| That won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| We may use a little bit of fund balance in debt service for $19,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| but it won't be the number that we budget for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| We just budget for what we would say is worst case scenario, and that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| There was no planned use of fund balance in the general purpose school fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| That's really an overview of the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| If you have any questions, I can answer it, or we can go on to the capital plan if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1153)|
| 0:19:23| First, I'd like to point out that there's no tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| And also that the sheriff's deputies will be getting a three-step and 2% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| When it comes to our operating budget, I've noticed that the price of oil is starting to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| Pretty common on the news right now, which can translate into some longer-term increases of gasoline prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| Do you think if we see our gas prices go up, not just a summer pop like you often see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| but if we see more of a longer-term gas prices, do you think that would have a material impact on our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| Or where do you think it would start to have more of a material impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| Sure, it definitely would have an impact in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| It definitely would have an impact in engineering and places like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| And so what we will do is if we see those prices continue to increase above and beyond what we had budgeted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| and we met with all those departments going over, you know, concerns or where we're at on certain line items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| and what you'll probably see us bring to you in the form of a designation in August is a one-time set of monies for gasoline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1225)|
| 0:20:36| in case there is that increase, that we will put aside for if they do exceed those numbers that we have budgeted for in gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1236)|
| 0:20:47| In the current year, I mean, Allison's back there, but I think we're fine on our gasoline budget currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| But there has been an increase the last two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| And so I think that has an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| And so we continue to watch that and think about how we could anticipate that if it did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| I'm sure the schools need to be watching that, too, especially as it relates to the buses and all that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| Joe Snyder is back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I think he was shaking his head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| And so I think you may see somewhere from them a designation to cover an expense that could be unanticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Hey, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Did the school system ever come back with a more extended capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Are we still just looking at two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| What we received from the schools was a two-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| And what we did, just to put a number in there for FY21, 22, and 23, we put a number of 10 million in there for those three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1296)|
| 0:21:45| Historically, it may be closer to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| But in 2020, the number that they gave was 7.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| I know Joe may make it speak to why just a two-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| I know Joe's interim finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| They may not have a general idea of what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Those latter three years, I think if you ask Joe, he'll probably speak for himself now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| but there's a number in their general purpose school fund that goes to pay for debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| And I'm sure he would tell you he'd like to see that number decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| And the way to do that is to lower what they've been borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Yeah, I mean, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Your name, please, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Joe Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| 1126 Bellevue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| Mr. Oaks is the one that compiles and works with the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| So outside of Chris's remarks, I don't want to speak to any details of that for fear of getting them wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| Well, I know it's a policy issue, but I think we've got some big needs coming down the three- or four-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| And so it's not going to be 10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| And so our debt's going to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Yeah, and I've heard Russ speak to that in several of our budget conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| And I know part of historically what's happened is the MOU we've had with the county, and we've lived within those means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| So to your point, sir, we have some needs coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| I appreciate you coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Okay, is Shanna Mills here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| Is there anyone in the audience that wishes to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| Do any of my fellow commissioners have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180524BudgetPublicHearing?start=1421)|
