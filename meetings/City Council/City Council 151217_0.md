| 0:01:27| Call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=87)|

| 0:01:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| We have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| All here except the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| And obviously I'm not the Mayor, but I'm substituting for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| She has an illness in her family and certainly sends her regrets that she can't be here with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| But she did assure me that she will be here Saturday for the swearing in of four council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| members, the city judge, and her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| So that will be at 1030 this Saturday in this room, and everyone of course is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| Immediately following that, we'll have a special call council meeting to elect the Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| and the CAT representative in the beer board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| And that will be held in the small assembly right next door, and then it will be followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| by a reception, and that will be in the main forum of the atrium of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| So with that in mind, I wanted to remind everybody that the city of Knoxville offices will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| closed on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| And I hope, and for the Mayor and the administration, they hope, as well as council, that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| has a wonderful holiday with their family and friends and to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| And lastly, don't forget to come downtown on Thursday, December the 21st to ring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| the New Year on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| There will be a ball drop at midnight, and the holidays on Ice Skating Rink will be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| late so you can skate right into 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=191)|
| 0:03:21| Are there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Councilman Delvaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| I just wanted to report to this council that after several years of our struggling together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| and separately, I suppose, we have finally gotten to the point where the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| has awarded a contract for logo signs in Knoxville, Tennessee, well, statewide, but in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| Tennessee, in jurisdictions that have over 100,000 population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| That means, hopefully, that before too long, Exit 8 on I-640 will have some signs notifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| There really is real stuff if they'll just get off the interstate there, and it'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| real convenient, and it will help those businesses and the families that depend on those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| So I think it's great, and I just wanted to let you know the company is Interstate Sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| There will be a changing of the guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| They are out of Atlanta, Georgia, and they have already appointed a representative for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| this area, but they won't start until January 1, but that is taking place finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| I know there's been a lot of hard work in behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Councilwoman Palm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| TDOT Commissioner Schor came to the TPO meeting on Wednesday of this week and talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| road needs in Tennessee, not necessarily new construction, but maintenance of the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| and highways that we have, our pedestrian ways, so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| I will be posting on the city council forum kind of a synopsis with a link to a website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=291)|
| 0:04:59| that has an overview of TDOT needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| The interesting thing is that there are $6 billion worth of projects in the pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| say it's $6 billion with a B, and about a billion of those are in Knox County in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| city of Knoxville, but there is not adequate funding for all of them, and so I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| sharing the commissioner's figures and numbers and some other thoughts with council and anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| in the public who wants to look at the council forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Thank you very much, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| I need approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| I'd like to withdraw 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| I had mentioned this at the last council meeting, almost at the 11th hour, that between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| Bearden Council and the owners of the property that we came up with a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| There were several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| There were several issues that were discussed by both parties, and a compromise was reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| and it ended up as a very positive situation, and that the restaurant will be built on Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| Avenue, but I just want to reiterate to my colleagues that it was an example of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| both the business and the neighborhoods and the businesses in the community got together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| and came up with a compromise in order for this business to go on, so we'd like to withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=388)|

| 0:06:33| Are there any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| It's an old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Any items to be requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| We have consent items 11A, a certificate of compliance, and 12B, 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=398)|

| 0:06:43| 11A is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=403)|

| 0:06:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Fred D. Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| Jr. in an amount of $55,000 to provide governmental relations services for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| Moved for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Councilman DeLaVolt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=426)|

| 0:07:14| This is great. Of course, Tony has served the city well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| I just would like to renew the request that we had in the past that we get a little more of that information flow down to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=439)|
| 0:07:27| I know we have gotten some general issues provided to us, but I think it is healthy for us to keep our eye on the ball, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| and we may pick up information we can share back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| It's my understanding that we got the report that the administration –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| Yeah, we got it last time, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Yeah, last year, so I'm sure now we can get him to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| You have gotten that, and of course, I will pass along to Mr. Thompson your request to continue to be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| any information that's available that you can utilize, and I'm sure he'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| He wanted to extend his apologies for not being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| If you'd like to talk to him directly about it, he will be here for the inauguration on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| He will also be here at the meeting on January 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| He seems to have been a steadfast servant of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| We appreciate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=490)|

| 0:10:26| or do we cite them also for violating the state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=626)|

| 0:11:05| on a garbage complaint through Waste Connections and then through the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=665)|

| 0:11:14| and said she was very thankful that someone listened to her complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151217?start=674)|
