| 2:48:25| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| I'd like to make a motion that we approve CA general business zone because it's compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10107)|
| 2:48:32| with surrounding development subject to two conditions and deny the request to remove the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| historic zoning overlay as recommended by the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10117)|
| 2:48:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10128)|
| 2:48:49| Okay. So we've got a motion by Commissioner Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| to approve per staff recommendation, seconded by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10134)|
| 2:49:03| Ms. Crockett, I wish I would have done a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10143)|
| 2:49:06| research on this, but I'm still trying to figure out, and I know this is a little bit of speculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10146)|
| 2:49:13| but I'm guessing maybe they wouldn't approve like a cinder block building or vinyl siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10153)|
| 2:49:21| Is that kind of what we're talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| I think that's a good example. The materials and more than that even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10163)|
| 2:49:30| just the massing of the building and the placement of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| is recommended to be compatible with the context. So I know there are already different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10173)|
| 2:49:40| restrictions and requirements in the base zoning code for the CA, but they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| discouraged from constructing a 20 story building that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| clad in vinyl or something like that. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10191)|
| 2:49:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10196)|
| 2:49:57| I'll say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10198)|
| 2:50:00| My light doesn't work still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10200)|
| 2:50:04| You know, the Historic Zoning Commission is going to look at things differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| through a different lens as what they're protecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| And we're supposed to be looking at the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| And this piece of property is on a major commercial, you know, it's a major arterial in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10213)|
| 2:50:19| And if we're going to leave the historic on the back as wide as a swath as that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10219)|
| 2:50:27| and then also require the tree protection on the front 50 feet of John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10227)|
| 2:50:34| it's going to be tough to really pull off a great deal on that piece anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10234)|
| 2:50:41| So I'm probably not going to be supporting that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10241)|
| 2:50:49| Okay. We've got a motion and a second to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10249)|
| 2:50:56| So let's get to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10256)|
| 2:50:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10257)|

| 2:51:05| But let's just for to be safe, let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10265)|

| 2:51:53| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion that we approve the CA general business zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10313)|
| 2:51:59| as requested with the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| conditions with no historic zoning on the first two and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10324)|
| 2:52:11| 2.6 was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10331)|

| 2:52:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10336)|
| 2:52:18| Are we specific enough on that description or do we need to draw a line on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10338)|
| 2:52:22| map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| It's 2.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10345)|
| 2:52:26| Oh, 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10346)|
| 2:52:27| Sorry, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10347)|
| 2:52:31| Is that sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10351)|

| 2:52:36| Okay, so we've got a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10356)|
| 2:52:40| to remove, basically remove the historic zoning on the 2.5 acres front part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10360)|
| 2:52:45| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| Commissioner Huber has seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10367)|
| 2:52:51| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10371)|

| 2:52:54| Okay, Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10374)|

| 2:53:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10383)|
| 2:53:04| All right, so let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10384)|

| 2:53:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10410)|
| 2:53:39| Agenda item 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| Applicant, RCEP, Orbit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| Location, southeast side of Bob Gray Road, west side of Pellissippi Parkway, 9.77 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10424)|
| 2:53:50| Present zoning is business and technology park and technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10430)|
| 2:53:55| Zoning requested, planned residential and technology overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10435)|
| 2:53:58| existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10438)|
| 2:54:03| Density proposed, 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10443)|
| 2:54:08| Staff recommendation is to approve the planned residential zone up to 12 dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| acre because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10453)|
| 2:54:17| subject to the one noted condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10459)|

| 2:54:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10463)|
| 2:54:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10466)|
| 2:54:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10474)|
| 2:54:35| Would you all like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10475)|
| 2:54:39| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| My name is Beth Quinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10481)|
| 2:54:42| My address is 1048 Blinken Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| I live in the community to the south and I'm the HOA president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10485)|
| 2:54:49| They're speaking on behalf of my HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10489)|
| 2:54:53| Just a couple of quick items, nothing major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10493)|
| 2:54:56| First, the notifications were not posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10496)|
| 2:54:59| As it states in the documentation that we received online, the 12F24RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10499)|
| 2:55:11| it states that it has to be placed in the most traveled area, the notification of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10511)|
| 2:55:21| As well, the address on the application is actually Pellissippi, but the notifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10521)|
| 2:55:27| were placed on Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| It said that this could be done if the planning staff recommended a preferred area for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10530)|
| 2:55:36| to be posted, but I didn't see that in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10536)|
| 2:55:41| Secondly, for our community, there is something called a step out that's recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10541)|
| 2:55:49| We would just like to know where that step out would be connected to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10549)|
| 2:55:55| As we have private roads right now, and of course, the way you can see the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10555)|
| 2:56:01| set up there, if you put a step out through the middle, would we then have to drive out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10561)|
| 2:56:08| on to Bob Gray after you close our access to Pellissippi through their community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10568)|
| 2:56:15| That opens their community to our community, which if it's like us, condos or things along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10575)|
| 2:56:21| those lines, we're not objecting to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| We're just wondering, as private streets, does that mean also that Knox County would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10584)|
| 2:56:31| take over our streets as they opened it up to a public zoning almost by opening it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| to this other community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| Sorry, this is my first one of these, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| That's all right, we'll have staff address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10601)|
| 2:56:45| Okay, and then we do have right in the front, and when you come in to our community, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10605)|
| 2:56:51| the front to the right, there is a very large dip, and when it rains, it floods quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10611)|
| 2:57:00| few feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| So if you're going to take away that forested area right there, it would also cause extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10622)|
| 2:57:09| drain off for us in that area, and to be honest, the infrastructure there is crumbling and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10629)|
| 2:57:17| old at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| We just ask that that be addressed so it doesn't cause extra damage to that area in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10639)|
| 2:57:28| as it is just common, one of the only places we have common lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10648)|
| 2:57:39| Lastly, we would like to know what type of structures they're going to be putting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10659)|
| 2:57:44| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| Our pool is right there, so we wouldn't want massive apartment complexes where people could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10665)|
| 2:57:51| just sit and look down on us at our pool, like I'm sure you wouldn't like your neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10671)|
| 2:57:56| to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10676)|
| 2:57:57| You know, we're not, we know we don't control the fate of this property, but we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10677)|
| 2:58:04| that it does fall in line with the houses and the community that it's going to be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10684)|
| 2:58:10| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10690)|

| 2:58:35| We are asking for additional time, 30 days or 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10715)|
| 2:58:40| We would like to look at some of the issues involving the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10720)|
| 2:58:43| The notice was not actually given to many of these residents until last week because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10723)|
| 2:58:49| of where it was placed, and apparently only two people got postcards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10729)|
| 2:58:52| There are a number of people in this community who would like to participate in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| but who didn't feel like they have enough notice and haven't had enough time to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| at the issues presented, particularly with the roads issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10739)|
| 2:59:03| This property, since its inception, accesses directly off of Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10743)|
| 2:59:10| Parkway Heights does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10750)|
| 2:59:11| That's Oden Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| They would never allow that now, but apparently at the time that that was done, Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10753)|
| 2:59:17| Parkway was not yet an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| So they have what I think is a rather advantageous exclusive access on and off of Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10764)|
| 2:59:25| If this happens as proposed, we understand that TDOT has said that they would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10765)|
| 2:59:31| close our access and instead make us go through the new development and access at Bob Gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10771)|
| 2:59:37| Road, and that's a very significant change that my clients are being asked to make in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10777)|
| 2:59:44| response to this change in zoning and change in use of the vacant property above them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10784)|
| 2:59:48| We would like to have the opportunity to hire an independent traffic study engineer to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10788)|
| 2:59:55| at that and to look at what the impact would be of taking away that private access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10795)|
| 2:59:58| How would you deal with all of that traffic going up on Bob Gray Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10798)|
| 3:00:04| I don't think there's a signal there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10804)|
| 3:00:05| And we don't know exactly what is proposed as far as the number of units, but it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| go to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| So it's quite a few units in addition to what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| And the major impact of this rezoning and the major impact of this development of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10814)|
| 3:00:20| property is really on Parkway Heights because that fundamental issue of access is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10820)|
| 3:00:25| apparently going to be affected because the documents mention the TDOT closing of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10825)|
| 3:00:30| access off of Pellissippi and the stud road that's going to be required for us to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10830)|
| 3:00:36| a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10836)|
| 3:00:37| We just need time to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| That's very serious for us, something that we're having to look at only because of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| our neighbors are proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| So we understand that ultimately you may look at rezoning this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| They have a right to use their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| I think Beth was very clear about that, but we just want to understand how it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10850)|
| 3:00:54| to affect us, and we'd like to have the time to get professional help to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10854)|

| 3:01:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10861)|
| 3:01:06| Hello, Katie Wozek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10866)|
| 3:01:08| I work for, I guess, 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| I work for Battenheims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| We're the engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| This, of course, is just a rezoning, but I'm here representing the owner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10876)|
| 3:01:21| Um, they had a lot of questions, I guess, that are maybe not directed at me, but I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10881)|
| 3:01:28| try to answer, um, some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10888)|
| 3:01:32| I would just like to say that we are in agreement with staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| Um, one of those recommendations is a stub out to Parkway Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10896)|
| 3:01:42| Um, I was not really informed about, like, the closure of Odin Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10902)|
| 3:01:50| Um, I guess it's kind of, like, a separate issue from our rezoning, but, um, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10910)|
| 3:01:58| 12 dwelling units per acre, we don't have any, like, layouts or anything currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10918)|
| 3:02:04| Um, so because we are requesting the PR zone, we will have to come back to this body with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10924)|
| 3:02:11| like, a concept plan to get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| Um, so the rezoning is just kind of to even get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10933)|
| 3:02:18| Um, we can't really, it doesn't make sense to do a concept and everything if, um, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10938)|
| 3:02:24| property isn't going to be rezoned, um, but that is something, you know, we'll, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10944)|
| 3:02:31| we're going to look at, um, how best to serve, um, the Parkway Heights neighborhood that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10951)|
| 3:02:39| you know, connecting the two based on what, um, TDOT and the counties recommend, recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10959)|
| 3:02:45| um, will require some, you know, conversations and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10965)|
| 3:02:51| Um, the access as recommended, I think will be from Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10971)|
| 3:02:59| So not off the interstate as discussed, um, things like traffic studies and, um, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10979)|
| 3:03:06| that they had mentioned, um, that's kind of based off of things we propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10986)|
| 3:03:13| So a traffic study might be required, um, like at the concept stage when you're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10993)|
| 3:03:18| like, just how many people or how many lots or houses that we are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=10998)|
| 3:03:24| And then you kind of go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11004)|
| 3:03:25| So, um, these are all things that I think we can definitely talk more about, um, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11005)|
| 3:03:31| the rezoning and once we get into like a conceptual design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11011)|
| 3:03:36| Um, but since this is just rezoning, I can't really address most of those until we, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11016)|
| 3:03:43| do a layout and hear from staff how they feel about the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11023)|
| 3:03:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11032)|
| 3:03:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| A question for, I guess, the county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11033)|
| 3:04:08| Have you all heard some of the concerns from the neighbors about TDOT wanting to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11048)|
| 3:04:14| off that section and move it to Bob Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11054)|
| 3:04:18| And if so, what does that do to the private roads that are currently there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| Do those become public or do they remain private?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11061)|
| 3:04:25| I think they would remain private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11065)|
| 3:04:26| And yes, TDOT in the mobility plan does have Pellissippi Parkway becoming access control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11066)|
| 3:04:33| So it is their wishes that this access be closed and for us to seek an alternate entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11079)|
| 3:04:40| I think this would provide that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11080)|
| 3:04:44| And to the opposition, I'm just thinking through timelines right this second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11084)|
| 3:04:51| Thinking through a 30-day postponement as you propose, I don't know what you could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11091)|
| 3:04:56| accomplished in 30 days with the holidays and everything right around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| I mean, that's pretty aggressive considering the holidays and all of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11099)|
| 3:05:06| So I guess the question is, you know, if we were to approve what's before us today, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11106)|
| 3:05:13| doesn't do anything except change zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11113)|
| 3:05:16| That still gives you time to do your own independent traffic studies and all of that stuff for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| us to consider once we see more of the concept plan from what they're wanting to do to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11120)|
| 3:05:26| how that impacts you all, what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11126)|
| 3:05:29| But what we would do today doesn't actually negatively impact you right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11129)|
| 3:05:33| Not directly, but I think what we could look at if we had time, which we haven't had, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11133)|
| 3:05:38| what is current zoning versus what is proposed as far as the 12 units per acre zoning as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11138)|
| 3:05:44| far as impact of traffic and impact of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| I think that what they're proposing is a bigger impact than what is currently zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11146)|
| 3:05:51| as far as number of trips per day and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| So we're just asking for the time to look at that and see if that might affect the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11155)|
| 3:06:01| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11161)|
| 3:06:04| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| I think Vice Chair Hooten might be wanting to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11166)|
| 3:06:13| You might have your light on that doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11173)|
| 3:06:14| Yeah, he didn't recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11176)|
| 3:06:25| Yeah, I just wanted to echo too that yeah, it's a planned residential, it's a planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11185)|
| 3:06:30| zone and that's really what we're here today to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11190)|
| 3:06:33| Not necessarily the development plan or what's going to happen with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11193)|
| 3:06:37| The property at Parkway Heights is already zoned planned residential at 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11197)|
| 3:06:41| So it's the same exact zoning that you guys have in your complex now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11201)|
| 3:06:47| It's zoned business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| I would think that would almost be more disruptive than anything else that could go in and planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11209)|
| 3:06:55| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11215)|
| 3:06:56| I mean, you're talking about office buildings that could be unknown height, that type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11216)|
| 3:07:01| thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11221)|
| 3:07:01| So I mean, not trying to rush it because I agree with Commissioner Smith that a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11221)|
| 3:07:08| these answers and questions will come out over time, but the time to address those is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11228)|
| 3:07:14| during the review stage of the planning portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11234)|
| 3:07:18| So that being said, I'd like to make a move, motion to approve the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11238)|
| 3:07:25| zone up to 12 units an acre because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11245)|
| 3:07:29| developments subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11252)|
| 3:07:34| We've got a motion to approve for staff recommendation by Commissioner Huber, seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11254)|
| 3:07:38| by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11258)|
| 3:07:39| Vice Chair Uten, you are recognized and you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11259)|
| 3:07:46| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11266)|
| 3:07:52| I think we're all pretty clear on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| I just want to make sure that the county is prepared with TDOT to not hold up whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11275)|
| 3:08:03| is going on with this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11283)|
| 3:08:07| Obviously, it's given everybody an opportunity to do this, but I really think that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11287)|
| 3:08:12| to be a little careful about penalizing this new developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11292)|
| 3:08:17| I said it at a general review meeting, penalizing the new developer to take on an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11297)|
| 3:08:23| 12 per the acre going through their property that they don't really have control of, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11303)|
| 3:08:27| they're being forced to accommodate any additional improvements beyond what their 12 would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11307)|
| 3:08:35| on Bob Gray need to be accommodated a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11315)|
| 3:08:40| Whether or not they're going to have to do bigger stub roads to accommodate that traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11320)|
| 3:08:45| or sidewalks or any of those things that they might have to do, I can't imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11325)|
| 3:08:51| It's definitely better than Pellissippi Parkway access, no doubt, but I can't imagine how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11331)|
| 3:08:56| you're going to be able to accommodate all those units coming out on Bob Gray with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11336)|
| 3:09:00| bridge abutment and that tight area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11340)|
| 3:09:07| I think that I would do a deep dive with the engineer before any concept plans come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11347)|
| 3:09:17| us and just make sure everybody's on the same page with those improvements and what it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| going to take and who's going to pay for what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11360)|
| 3:09:23| And the last thing I want to make sure I asked was on the existing development, it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11363)|
| 3:09:34| like there's a hammerhead built where all those units are around it, but it does look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11374)|
| 3:09:38| like there was an access, private access taken all the way over, and I just want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11378)|
| 3:09:43| sure that that is the case, that there is a paper access all the way over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11383)|
| 3:09:49| Is that common area or was there a stub out on the current development side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11389)|
| 3:09:59| Yeah, you can see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11399)|
| 3:10:00| Our understanding, that's private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| We're zoned as PUDs, so that's not a resident, like our, I guess, community area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11403)|
| 3:10:11| The only two we have is that front ditch that I mentioned that we call the lake and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11411)|
| 3:10:17| pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11417)|
| 3:10:18| The rest of the property lines you're seeing there are owned by an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11418)|
| 3:10:23| So that, you know, you may have to deal with some condemnation there, I guess is what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| getting at, to force somebody to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11426)|
| 3:10:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11429)|
| 3:10:30| I mean, that's not my property, thank God, but I can't speak to what you all will end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11430)|
| 3:10:39| up planning to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11439)|
| 3:10:42| I do know that if you have all the cars come up that way, it will be a very different feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11442)|
| 3:10:49| to that person's lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11449)|
| 3:10:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11450)|
| 3:10:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11451)|
| 3:10:52| So we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| Motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11454)|
| 3:10:55| Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11455)|
| 3:10:56| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11456)|
| 3:10:58| Just to clarify with that private right of way, it is a private right of way, it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| go to the property line, so it's not a lot or owned privately outside of the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11462)|
| 3:11:08| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11468)|
| 3:11:10| So the condition to require this stub out is really to provide options in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11470)|
| 3:11:16| So the intent isn't to require this developer to make that connection because there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11476)|
| 3:11:21| stream, there's a steep slope involved in making those connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11481)|
| 3:11:24| The intent is to provide that option if there's really no other great option to provide access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11484)|
| 3:11:30| for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11490)|
| 3:11:30| The options are running out for this development to have alternative access other than Pennsylvania| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11490)|
| 3:11:36| Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11496)|
| 3:11:37| And yes, we will need to consider how that might work with this future development, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11497)|
| 3:11:44| the intent isn't necessarily for them to physically make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11504)|
| 3:11:49| At least that's not what I've discussed so far with other staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11509)|
| 3:11:57| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| Just notice on KGIS, it looks like Boyington Road to the immediate west of the parcel also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11519)|
| 3:12:04| has a direct abutment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| So if you go north there to the lot, I was curious if that was considered as another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11527)|
| 3:12:12| potential access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11532)|
| 3:12:14| I know it goes into a residential neighborhood, but just curious if staff considered that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11534)|
| 3:12:19| or if that's kind of a non-starter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11539)|
| 3:12:23| Again, I think that would be a development plan at the next stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11543)|
| 3:12:26| We would look at all the options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11546)|
| 3:12:31| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11551)|
| 3:12:32| That's in an effort to avoid potentially wasted resources and hurt relationships between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11552)|
| 3:12:41| neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11561)|
| 3:12:42| I want to mention to the neighbors that if there are going to be changes going in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11562)|
| 3:12:52| required by TDOT, I think that if TDOT is saying that Ural's access has to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11572)|
| 3:12:59| and you have to go through here, that's, as someone pointed out, that's as much a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11579)|
| 3:13:04| burden on the development to your north as it is for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11584)|
| 3:13:08| So I would encourage working together, moving forward as they move into the next phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11588)|
| 3:13:14| which would be the planning phase, since this is just the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11594)|
| 3:13:19| And then I also, because there was some mention about the notifications, want to direct a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11599)|
| 3:13:26| question to staff and or legal just to make sure that there's no, I guess, misunderstandings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11606)|
| 3:13:33| that maybe something was done incorrectly and clarify that everything notification-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11613)|
| 3:13:40| was done properly in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11620)|
| 3:13:46| My understanding is that the notification was done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11626)|
| 3:13:49| We can double check our postcards that we send out, but again, the main legal requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11629)|
| 3:13:55| the only legal requirement for notification is in a newspaper of general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11635)|
| 3:14:01| In terms of posting of the sign, and Whitney can correct me, but I don't think that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11641)|
| 3:14:06| want our staff stopping along Pellissippi Parkway to post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11646)|
| 3:14:09| Also, that would be right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11649)|
| 3:14:12| So posting on Bob Gray is something that we would have recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11652)|
| 3:14:16| Is that where the sign was posted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11658)|
| 3:14:19| It was on Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11661)|
| 3:14:25| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11665)|
| 3:14:26| I just wanted to make sure because if there was a chance that a delay or thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11666)|
| 3:14:33| a delay might be able to be brought about through other means related to that, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11673)|
| 3:14:39| get it out there on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11679)|
| 3:14:40| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11680)|
| 3:14:43| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| Okay, Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11686)|
| 3:14:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11688)|
| 3:14:49| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11689)|
| 3:14:52| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11694)|
| 3:14:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| That's it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11698)|
| 3:14:58| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11698)|
| 3:15:00| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231214?start=11700)|
