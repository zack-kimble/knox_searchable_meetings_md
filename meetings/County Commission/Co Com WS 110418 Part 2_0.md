| 0:08:12| County Clerk, Knox County Trustee, Knox County Registrar of Deeds to transmit monthly off-fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| of their respective offices to the Knox County Trustee and to pay the salaries and expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| of said offices from the General Fund beginning Fiscal Year 2012-2013 and to amend Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| 2-478D, the Knox County Code, relative to the maintenance of excessive fees and equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| to three months of operating and payroll expenses in separate fee accounts. Ordinance O-90-9-122| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| adopted September 10, 1990 and Ordinance O-90-9-125 adopted September 10, 1990. On| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| first reading, Ordinance 102. Is there a motion? Move to approve. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| Motion has been made and seconded. Commissioner Anders. Yeah, I just wanted to discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| item a little bit. I know we're going into ordinance form, but I would like to ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| the Mayor's Office and the Commissioners that are interested and the affected parties, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| know, this is the first reading and it's got to go through two consecutive readings. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| so if this is approved Monday, I want to make sure that all the affected parties and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| all the interested commissioners sit down at a table, have discussion, talk about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| this does, what the intentions of this are, and what the possible repercussions of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| are. Because this is a big deal and I approve it on its face, but I want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| we're doing the right thing at the right time. And so I think I won't vote for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| time if the interested parties don't come together and meet. That's all I've got to say. Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| I think we're probably going to hear from the trustee here in just a little bit. But let me say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| first of all that really the motivation behind this ordinance has absolutely nothing to do with any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| suspicions of malfeasance in any of the fee offices that are mentioned in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| These offices now have been looked at from outsiders. They're very well run. We even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| had our auditors a couple of years ago, I think it was the year before last, looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| And in particular in the Office of the Registrar of the Deeds, there was absolutely nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| that they found that was out of order. Some of the others under previous administrators, they did find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| some issues, but that's past history and I don't want to go there. And I know people are asking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| why are we doing this? You know, we have a system right now. It's been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| They go through a salary suit for the salaries of the deputies and the employees in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| There's a budget that's there for the operations of the office. Why do we need to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| And I think that part of the criticism and part of the concerns that you hear ordinary citizens express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=658)|
| 0:11:07| is that there's this impression that there's things that aren't right down at the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| And at least at this particular point in time, from what I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| things are about as good as they've ever been probably in the past and things are working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| However, part of the reason that these suspicions are out there is that I think the public doesn't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=685)|
| 0:11:34| the system. Some of the language in this ordinance and the resolution that was brought forth last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| talked about transparency and this and that. And those are sort of popular words right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| I think probably a better word would be understandable. I really doubt if there's 200 people in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| 432,000 plus citizens that really understand the salary suit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| And the register of the deeds offices and many of the other offices have done a wonderful job putting this on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:06| So the system is, the information is out there, but it's trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| It's pretty much if I go, if I'm traveling in China and there's a sign up there on the wall that's written in Chinese calligraphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| and somebody says, do you see it? It's out there. It's there for everyone to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Yeah, I see it, but I really don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| I don't know what it means. And that's very similar with what I would like to do with this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| and why I think that we should pass this is that we want our citizens to understand a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:38| They understand a budget in the office that they work in. They understand a budget because every family has a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| They understand if you go to, if you have to go buy a car, you have to look how much money you're making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| how much money it's going to cost, and people understand budgets. They don't understand salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| Part of what's in this that's different than we do now, and I stand corrected if I say something improper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| is now all the fee offices, and this is the trustee, the county clerk, and register of the deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| these all take money or funds from the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| They run their offices on the funds they collect, and then they turn excess fees over to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| They are permitted to maintain a reserve of three months to be certain if there's months when there's not quite as much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:29| quite as many fees coming in, they have a way to continue to run their offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| And ideally, they're able to run their offices without having to dip into the county's general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| One of the things that changes with this is that they, at the end of every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| they return all of their excess fees over to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| They go through the trustee and be deposited in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| One of the things that's different than what we're doing right now is that they would submit a budget that would include salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| It would include the operations of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| The budget would be, they would come down, present the budget just like the sheriff's office does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| just like the property assessor office does, just like every department in the county, except for those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| Those three right now are not doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| In my opinion, the day-to-day operations of the office would not change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| What would change is just who pays the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| The bills would be sent as long as they're within their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| They would go to the county to pay the salaries and to run the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| The advantage of this is that it's a system that the public can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| There is a system of checks and balances right now with the salary suits because that goes to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| and then it goes to a judge to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| But I think if it actually comes before the elected representatives of the county, which is this legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| this board that we sit on here, is that the public's perception would be that there's better oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=894)|
| 0:15:03| and that elected representatives are looking very closely at the operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| And, again, we're talking much about perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| There's really two ways of looking at anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| There's reality and then there's perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| The reality is right now is that we've got good administrators running, good elected administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| and officers running these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| The perception is that the system isn't open in a way that the public understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| And what happens is that eventually perception can become reality because the reality of it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| is if you did a poll, I don't think it would be a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| but there would be a significant minority of people would say there's not enough oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| this is all being done behind closed doors, we need more people looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| But eventually the perception becomes reality because that's what people really think and that's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| And for that reason, and I agree exactly with what Commissioner Anders said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| I think we all ought to sit down to be sure that this is what we think it is when we implement this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| If this goes ahead and passes on second reading, I would encourage us to go ahead and pass this on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| We can sit down and I can tell you if it's not going to work or if it's something really bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| I'll be the first person to vote against it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| And I know some of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| I met with Sherry Witt, who's the elected register of the deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| and a couple of her deputies last week for an hour and a half or two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| And I really understand their concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| And I'll say that some of their concerns are, is that if at some point in the future we have a politically hostile commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:56| or a politically hostile mayor, is that either they wouldn't allocate sufficient funds for them to run their office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:04| or if you had a mayor, even if the funds were allocated, the finance director wouldn't write the checks to run the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| and they could use that as a political weapon against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| I don't think that that would occur for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| The first is that I hope that there would be enough maturity and enough of a sense of civic responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| that neither the commission nor the mayor's office would ever do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| But let's just suppose the worst case scenario that they did try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| I think that the first thing that would happen is that the law director would say, you cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| And then if the law director didn't say it, I think the state attorney general would say, you cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| One of the things that was clear from the Jordan ruling and the Bailey ruling that dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| that really put term limits on, you know, on the offices of the charter offices of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| is that the Supreme Court said there's not very many functions that the counties have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| but they have to have a way to collect the taxes through the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| You have to have a sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| You have to have a property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| You need to register the deeds and you need to have a county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| You don't have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Those functions have to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| I don't think there's any constitutional requirement that we have an engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| There's no constitutional requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| We have a health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| If we wanted to be politically hostile, we could eliminate those and just zero out their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| We cannot do that to those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Those offices have to function according to the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| Really what I'm proposing, I think functionally there will not be a whole lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| I think they'll run their offices very well, like they are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| I think that will happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| But what it does, it gives the public the sense that there's someone else looking at the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| There's a system of checks and balances, which at all levels of government we think is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:10| And ultimately, I think it allows the government to be more open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| It allows the public to have more confidence in the offices that they've elected these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| And for that reason, I would like to go ahead next Monday and vote on this, pass it on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:30| go ahead, we've got a month to do it, go ahead, get more input, just like Commissioner Anders said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| to be sure that this is workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| And then if it is and we can satisfy the office holders of those fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| that they can still do their functions and not have to be concerned about being held political hostage in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| that we should go ahead and pass this so the public has a system that they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| and that they can look at more easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| First, I want to say thank you to Commissioner Briggs for meeting with the Registrar's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Last month, when we voted to defer this, the reason was so that we could get the stakeholders together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:26| to sit down and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| And my understanding from the memo I got from the law director was that that resolution was pretty much dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:41| because it wasn't defensible, legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| So I'm wondering from the law director, is this one, how is this one different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| And what I had intended to do last month before I got the memo from the law director was to invite some people from CTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1253)|
| 0:21:04| to form a panel of two or three people who are disinterested, third party, not connected to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:15| or the mayor's office or the fee offices to come and have what amounted to not an official workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:24| but just an open meeting where anyone could come and bring their questions and have them answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| And I put that on hold because it was my understanding that the resolution was dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| and I didn't know that this was coming back up until about a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| So I would still like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| And I would like to suggest, Mr. Chairman, that we make it a regular workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| and that we invite some people from CTAS to come and let everyone who has a question write their question down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| and bring it and we'll have them answer it so that we do know exactly what this will mean for every office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:09| Because I agree that our government needs to be more understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| I'm totally on board with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| But it's not just as easy as putting the two budgets together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Like we learned last month, there are certain legal requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| There are checking accounts that don't necessarily go away because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| So I don't want us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| And that was part of the problem with doing it so rashly last month was the problem with unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| So I would like to invite a panel to come from CTAS and I would like to make it an official workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:53| and I would like to invite all of the commissioners, all of the fee office holders, the mayor, the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| anyone from the public who wants to come and ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| I would like to do that as quickly as possible so that we can get all of these questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| I feel like, and I do have that question for you, Joe, if last month it wasn't quite legal to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:22| what is the difference with this between the ordinance and the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| Is it simply that if we enact this and we get sued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| I've heard it described that it comes down to whether or not the judge thinks we have a great county charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| or the judge thinks we have a charter that's not worth the paper it's written on as to which way this would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| And also for our finance director, we have a requirement that there be a financial impact study done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:59| between first and second readings on ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| So I'm looking forward to seeing the financial impact on the county pro or con between first reading and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:14| Mr. Chairman, there's kind of multiple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Starting with CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Now, I involved CTAS originally because the multiple clients represented by my office under the charter were at odds with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| CTAS seemed like a good neutral ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| But CTAS's expertise, as they readily admit, is with constitutional forms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| And the reason a charter form of government is a difficult scenario because it's only two out of 95 counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| and it has been rarely, if ever, litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| And it's usually only to validate the validity of a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| CTAS defers to charter law directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| They're not going to come and interpret our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| They don't understand our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| And if you call them and that's no reflection on them, they don't have any greater insight than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| Now, they do have better resources as to the constitutional history and legislative histories of certain statutory enactments that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:09| But if you ask CTAS to come here and you ask them specific questions, they've never read our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| they've never interpreted our charter, and they're going to say, well, we'd like to hear from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| But they were the ones last month that found the thing that basically made last month's resolution moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| They found an infirmity in their own resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| But, again, I don't, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| So we need to have a workshop with you in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| What I'm saying is if you're thinking that or you're of the mind that CTAS has an expertise in interpreting our charter, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| And no one has, because, again, there's such precious little research done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| If you get on in the most sophisticated legal research and look at charter forms of government, you're going to find two cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| So my point is, for instance, this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| I can't tell this commission this ordinance is ironclad, it's solid, it's legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| and the judge wouldn't even waste his time or her time looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| They'd say, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| It's debatable because it's something new under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| The Tennessee Code does read that as a charter form of government, we can enact legislation that is not contrary to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| And making the jump that the previous resolution falls in that category, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| My point is this, if it came down to being litigated, if one of the officers challenged it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| a court would then look at the ordinance and they'd compare it to the charter and little else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| Because, again, it's not like they can say, well, the Supreme Court's already ruled on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| That's the dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| So you have an ordinance before you that I think, as an attorney, I have a good faith basis to argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| But I can't tell you definitively this is the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| And while we're on the subject, because there's a lot of concern, this applies to three offices only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| the county clerk, the register of deeds, and the trustee only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| And the only reason there is language in the end, because when you do an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| because you're amending your own code section, the code section listed therein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| So that's the bottom line in terms of the interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| So, you know, workshop is fine, and it would never be beyond me to say don't invite other lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| I confer with other lawyers all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| and CTAS has called me to assist them to interpret part of Shelby County's charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| That's the dilemma we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Well, I still think that a workshop would be a good idea, because I agree with Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| And I appreciate Dr. Briggs going to speak with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| That may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| I appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| I think it would be great to have everybody all together in one room at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Well, I will say this, and you're always on dangerous ground when you ever talk about sunshine versus open government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| but if you dispatch one commission representative on this, it's not a sunshine meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| That means if people want to be able to speak candidly and not, you know, fear of being monitored or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| literally at this point, since they're all separate officers and they're all from separate bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| if one commission representative went along with, you know, Sherry Witt and whoever else is involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| the trustee, the clerk, and the mayor, if they met together, there is no sunshine meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| So in other words, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| And they could be candid with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Once you open it up to another commissioner, now you've got a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| and now I don't know if people would be as candid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| I'm not asking for a public forum right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| I just want everyone to get together in the same room so that everybody hears exactly the same answer at exactly the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| because people are getting different answers depending on who they're talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| And I'm not saying that that's intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| but I think it would be beneficial to have all of us together in one room at one time discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| And I think that's the kind of example that we need to set, and that's what we need to be doing in this government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:20| We have two people who have signed up to speak, Howard Hogan and John King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| and I want to give each of you the opportunity to speak now if you would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| and then we'll go back to our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Howard Hogan, 312 Oak Park Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| I'm the clerk and master of Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| The law director has addressed my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| and that is that the ordinance has no application and is not intended to affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| or deal with the office of the clerk and master.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| So I will defer to the next party who was asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1794)|
| 0:30:21| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| you all have had a plate load today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| John, have you got some handouts that we need to pass out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| I'm going to in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| I don't have any handouts individually, but hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| I'll put some stuff in the record and I might explain what I do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| I say you've got a plate load and now you get me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| I'm here on my own behalf, and since my last appearance here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| I'm now speaking as well on behalf of Register of Deeds, Ms. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| My comments about what I have called my alternate view on this subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| my comments apply equally, however, to the other two fee officers now affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| although I understand they have said they're okay with this particular proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| or are all right with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| That is fine if they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| I would simply observe that each of them got elected to an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| and they took an oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| I commend them to read that oath of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| and then look at whether or not they're in compliance with that oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| if they voluntarily do something that is not proper under Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| and or constitutional law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| That's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| I don't undertake to advise them about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| I want to start with something Commissioner Briggs has said a number of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| and it's been said in the press about transparency and openness in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| And today he has said less than, I believe he said maybe 200 people understood the salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| If 200 understand the salary suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| it will be less than that that understands the county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| And if we want to talk about openness and ability to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| I'm going to illustrate it with a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| and I want to move on and talk about more ideas about the legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1942)|
| 0:32:51| There are at least two opportunities to make a record on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| I, for one, applaud the idea of having a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| It can be open to everybody on this commission, all the members of the public, any of the office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| I'll be happy to have that occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| I'll be happy to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| And those of you who know me probably realize I won't have any trouble about being candid in that meeting either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| It's not going to bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| I trust everybody understands that we all have different views at times, and we feel strongly about those views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| so we express them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| What I just passed up to her, that's the Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:34| It's about 270 some odd pages in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| For purposes of comparison, I'll take two offices in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| The property assessor, who is not a fee office, is the subject and is subject to this budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:54| On the other hand, you have the fee office of the Register of Deeds, Sherry Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| Anybody want to volunteer up there to find in this budget where the property assessor's number of authorized positions is located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:11| Do you want to find where in this budget, in this document, there's information about how much his employees are paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:21| Does anybody want to volunteer to try to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| There is an index that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| I suggest to you that at page, I believe it's 67, what happens is there's simply a number of authorized positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:37| for the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| At another page in this budget is a simple line item for personal services in that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:48| and it is a total number, an annual amount for all of his employees in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| It doesn't say who amongst them gets paid what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| It's just whatever it is, a million some odd thousand dollars, whatever that number is, for personal services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| That's what's in that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| If you wanted to find out what an office is doing and what it's paying its employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| would you rather look at this budget and all roughly 280 pages of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| or would you rather take another public document, for example, the salary suit from Sherry Witt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:26| At page two, it's a total of four pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| At page two, it has every position labeled by title, salaries per month for each one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:42| and a total amount on a monthly basis that those salaries shall not exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:50| At the third page, there's a couple of other items that indicate she's supposed to pay into the retirement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:59| certain amounts and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| I think I would suggest to you, I would respectfully submit to you, this is a lot more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| It sure as heck is easy to understand when I look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| and it says the chief deputy's salaries per month shall not exceed $6,940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| Or an index clerk, her monthly salary shall not exceed $2,850.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| You will not find that kind of information in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:43| I want to talk to you about the legal aspects of this claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| We started out, we had this proposal made on the basis of a statute that was found to not be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:55| We were going to apply the requirements for submission of all these fees directly to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2215)|
| 0:37:04| Their employees then get paid out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| They're subject to the budget process, subject to the mayor's approval, subject to y'all's approval, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| And it applied to everybody, the fee offices, court officers, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| Then we found out that wasn't legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| It's sort of been like a moving bubble of mercury a little bit, a moving target, however you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| however you want to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| And now we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| We don't base this on any statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| We're just going to pass an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| We're a charter county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| We're going to pass an ordinance and require these officers to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| We're not basing it on any state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| Well, in addition to that, it no longer applies to the court officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| That is, the circuit court clerk, the clerk and master, criminal court clerk, general assistance court clerk, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| It's just going to apply now to these fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| I suggest to you that before it was not legally well based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| It's just as faulty and just as questionable now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| I went back and I started with where this all gets started about the constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| Article 7, Section 1 of the Tennessee State Constitution says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| the qualified voters of each county shall elect for terms of four years a legislative body, a county executive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:34| a sheriff, a trustee, a registrar, a county clerk and assessor of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| Their qualifications and duties shall be prescribed by the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:49| I found it sort of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| It's totally an aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| But that Constitution says the voters of the county shall elect for terms of four years a legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| yet we've got some sitting on this legislative body that got elected to a six-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:09| In any event, TCA 8-13-101 and the following sections is a section that deals with the qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:19| and duties of the office of register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| Each of those other fee offices has a similar section of the code that describes their duties and their qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Also applicable to all the fee offices and to the clerks of the court and the sheriff, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| are provisions of 8-20-101 and the following sections, setting out the provision for the filing of the so-called salary suits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:43| and include provisions of a letter of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| And any salary suit shall name the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| You all know that whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| He can raise questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| He can object to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| After it's been adopted, he can come back by motion and ask that some aspect of it be reconsidered at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| If there's a dispute, the court is going to decide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| We're now essentially attempting to do what the first resolution was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| It's just done it in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| It appears that the idea is somehow advanced that once Knox County has a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| that it somehow trumps the constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| and that offices created by the constitution with the duties and qualifications set by the General Assembly are somehow done away with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| and it's the charter that is the be-all and end-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| I may have my own opinion in view of that, but this may not be the forum to argue at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| I do think, however, it's relevant, even if one assumes that legal assertion to be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:53| I would call to your attention that the enabling legislation for the charter form of government says very plainly at TCA 5-1-210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2453)|
| 0:41:05| That the duties of the constitutional county officers as prescribed by the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| shall not be diminished under a county charter form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| To me, that's pretty plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| I think it's very plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| And we can talk about the Jordan case and the Bailey case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| and all those arguments advanced back and forth one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| One thing we know for sure, well, two things we know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| The Jordan case says you can set term limits on constitutional officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| because it's in the enabling legislation that you can determine their, quote, qualifications for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| And the court decided that's one of the qualifications, is prior service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| Nowhere in there, in that enabling legislation, does it say you can do away with their terms of office, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2511)|
| 0:42:00| or you can change their duties inconsistent with the Constitution and the laws of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| The second thing we know is the decision in Bailey, and I'm quoting from the case, the Jordan case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:17| the decision in Bailey implied that Tennessee Code Annotated 5-1-210, which I just read to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:27| provides that it is when the charter does retain constitutional county offices in the alternate form of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:37| that the duties as already described by our Constitution and statute may not be diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| That's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| We put those fee offices in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| And this clearly says when you do that, you can't diminish their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| Mr. King, how much longer do you think you're going to need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| I could be a lot longer, but I'm going to wind it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| I think I'm going to have another opportunity to be heard, so I'll go on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:10| When we talk about the statutory basis, at 5-1-211 it says that the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:18| and this is what the preface to the ordinance that you're looking at right now says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| the legislative body of each county that adopts a charter form of county government may pass ordinance relating to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| purely county affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| That's where the quote stops in your preface to your ordinance up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| I would note that it stops in mid-sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| The rest of that sentence at 5-1-211 says after you can pass ordinance related to purely county matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:51| but it says, and I quote, but such ordinance shall not be opposed to the general laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:59| and shall not interfere with local affairs of any municipality within the limit of such county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:07| It can't be opposed to the general laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| The general laws are those of the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| The general law is part of the general law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| If we accept as true the county has the authority to create by adding a new ordinance amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| making these people subject to the budget requirements, you put these fee offices in a legal conundrum or quandary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:34| It's sort of very difficult and an unacceptable position to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| Each one of those officers is set out in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| and in each instance it says what they are bound by or bound to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| and it says the constitution and laws of the state of Tennessee and the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| You've got a requirement of one way of doing business under the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| and now the charter proposed you're going to do it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| And what you've done is put them in a position of having to choose which law they're going to abide by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| and which law they're going to violate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| Let me just say that you, by passing this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| are putting in place the potential of another legal collision playing out somewhere in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| And nobody really, I think, wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| The office holders don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| And I ask that you not create such an inevitability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| You haven't as yet diminished the duties of the constitutional county officers that are protected by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:44| You haven't done it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Don't do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| There always was and there still is good policy, good public policy reasons for having those offices be independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| and be self-sufficient as to their services and delivery services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| It's worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| It's already been acknowledged here today that it works pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| But somehow or other, since the public doesn't understand it, we're worried about their perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| All I suggest to them is they can pick up their phone or they can come down here to this courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| or they can go online, they can look at any records they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| But if they really want to know who's working in an office, one of these fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| how much they're being paid and how it got determined, I suggest to you reading a four-page salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| It's a heck of a lot easier than reading the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| Mr. King, just so I understand, did you say that you're representing the Register of Deeds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Since my last time, I've had conversations with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| She's asked that I, in essence, speak on her behalf and counsel with her, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| Are you being paid to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| I will have a fee arrangement with her, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| So you're being paid to come in and, okay, I just want to make sure I understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| I'll be making a charge for it, let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| It will not be a charge that comes to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| I'm really giving an aside right now, something to the comments of the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| speaking to the possibility of a suppressed and open, candid discussion in a meeting that will have to be sunshined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:32| if two or more commissioners are in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| I would suggest to you that a lot more would be coming out of a meeting discussing this policy or procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:48| Negative statements would be coming out of it if only one commissioner went and it was held in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2868)|
| 0:48:00| That's one of the things I think we've come to over the last couple of years is that we have to be verbal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:08| We have to take up our cause or we have to speak to whatever we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| and it needs to be a sunshined meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| If we're going to have a meeting, that's an aside that I'm making about we need to discuss this topic in public, my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:25| If I could, Commissioner, I was asked to report whether or not there could be such a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| I'm not a proponent of a meeting either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| That's certainly a legislative decision, how you get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| But I was asked if only one commissioner went, is that a sunshine meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| That was my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| And that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| And I stand by we can't have one commissioner in a closed meeting of people discussing this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| This has to be in the open, and it doesn't matter who says what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| Then we know where everyone stands on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| The other, I'll speak to the point that I see this to be the fifth time that this has been before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:08| and I'll be quite steadfast in my belief that things are working okay now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| In the business world, people rise to their level of incompetency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| In the political world, people that are incompetent aren't elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:30| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Mr. King, you stated just a few minutes ago that the salary suit is easy to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2971)|
| 0:49:39| Is that what I understood you to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| It's easier than the budget, which I may agree with that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| Pretty straightforward, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Would you, in a business that you own, allow your partner to spend an unlimited amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| on whatever they wanted to spend it on without your knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| Well, I've got a lot of partners, and I can't keep up with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Well, I'm just saying, if you had three partners in a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| and one of them had the ability to write any check they wanted to write, would you approve of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| I wouldn't want that to be done, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| I'll discuss with you what I see in a couple of these salary suits that allow some of our officeholders to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| and I'll be more than happy to discuss it with you and let you educate me on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| But we have some salary suits that allow that very thing to be done, and I think that's bad practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| Again, if you have a salary suit that permits that, your county mayor agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| But you said they're simple and easy to understand, and they're straightforward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| and they have a definite answer, and some of these do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| But I'll let you educate me on that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| Well, hopefully we'll both educate each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| I just wanted to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| We heard sort of a very good legal argument as to why the counties that work under the Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3052)|
| 0:51:01| why this may or may not be legal in those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| But I think there's a confusion between us being a charter county versus a constitutional county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| And I want to quote here directly from the Jordan decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| and it says a unanimous court observed that the Tennessee Constitution grants a broad authority to a county to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| so far as to replace its existing government in favor of an alternative government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| And it goes on to say this court rejects the notion that an alternative form of government formed under the third paragraph of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:39| Article 7, which has been quoted, must conform to the language of the qualification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| and duties of the elected officials prescribed by the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| The Supreme Court rejected that argument that the General Assembly sets those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| and the state constitution gives the authority for an alternative form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| We really have two alternative forms of government in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| We have the charter government and then we have metro government in Nashville, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| And then it goes on to say, and they talked about that very specifically in the Jordan decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| and this is why we needed to make a correction to our county charter in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| It basically said that once we adopted the county form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| is that these other offices, and it included the sheriff, it included the fee offices, it included many of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| they said they did not exist de jure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| And I think de jure means according to law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| In other words, they did not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| They existed de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| In fact, they were doing their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| But according to the law, they did not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| And that was one of the corrections that we had to make in November of 2006 is to put those back into our county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| I mean, they just didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| And the court goes on to say that, and again, we can't confuse the office with the duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:07| The Constitution, the Supreme Court did not say we had to have those officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| They said they had to perform those duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| And that's the point, you know, I want to make with this is that if ever you had a hostile commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:24| a hostile mayor that did not fund them to the extent that they could perform their duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| I think the law director would not permit that to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| and I think the state attorney general would not allow that to occur because those duties must be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| it's an obligation for those services and duties to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:49| And just if somebody said something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| Well, I was just going to, I put in writing in a previous memo that this system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| regardless of what vehicle you use, it cannot be used to preclude these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| from doing their state and constitutional and county mandated duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| And I think that is a concern of some people that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| once the budget comes under another part of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| then their duties and responsibilities are hampered by lack of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| That's just impermissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| It's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| And that would breed a suit and a judge would hear that expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| If an officer came and said we cannot function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| we cannot perform our state mandated duties because they've underfunded us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| that is a valid legal argument and there is plenty of case precedent on that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| May I respond to your point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| And I don't mean, I don't want to interrupt, but you made the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| and that's the reason I purposely went beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| I have my own views and maybe a strongly held legal opinion about a lot that's in the Jordan case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:06| that is really dicta and how binding it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| I say I'm not going to get into an argument about that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| but it is clear that they did say, and as I quoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| Tennessee Code 5-1-210-12 says that when the charter does retain those officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3320)|
| 0:55:30| then their duties as already discussed by our Constitution and statute may not be diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:39| They're in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| They're in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| For example, the Register of Deeds, and it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| The duties are vested in and exercised by the Knox County Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| The duties, qualifications, oath of office, bond requirements, and compensation of the Register of Deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| shall be governed by the Constitution and laws of the State of Tennessee and the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| So, I mean, clearly, clearly the enabling legislation says if you're going to carry them forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| then you can't diminish their duties, and that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| Well, see, I think we don't have an argument there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| I don't want to diminish their duties at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| I don't think we could, even if we wanted to, because it's very clear from the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| from the state constitution that those duties shall, they must occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| What we're talking about is just whether they submit a budget or not, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| And I know we say that anybody that's elected to office is intelligent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| they're smart, they're honest, but you have to remember, in the last three years, in an elected office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| we've had audits that found, and thank goodness we did do audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| but we found that there were abuses of the P-card, and there was a trial that just concluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| I think on Friday or Saturday, or maybe it was even today when they finally decided what they were going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| with one of the people of that administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| We had an audit that showed that there were things that were not done right with the travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| and there were a total of four audits that were done on an elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| Now, should we let that elected officer just do what he wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| and then when the people get tired of him or his term is up in four years that it's over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| they can elect someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| I think there needs to be checks and balances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| and I think it needs to be something that the public can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| I think the public does understand the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| We can bring a budget that's this big for the entire county that includes the school system and everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| but people still understand a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| And I could go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| I've got the Jordan opinion right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| I've got a whole 36 or so pages with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| But, I mean, I know that's arguable, and you can say that the Supreme Court was wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| but the fact of the matter is that that's the ultimate authority on state affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| There's nowhere higher to appeal it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| And whether you agree, disagree, it really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| That's what the Supreme Court has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| And that's what we have to live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Ms. Quist, would you like to make a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| I see you're sneaking up on the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| I'm Kathy Quist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| I'm the circuit sales, sessions, and juvenile court clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| and I am the sole remaining defendant from Jordan that still owes outstanding legal fees from going through that journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:35| I'm also an attorney licensed in the state of Tennessee and work very hard as your circuit court clerk, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| As with the risk of, you know, begging redundancy, it's not that you can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:51| It's just that it needs to be done appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| And the charter form of government is blazing new trails legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| And sometimes those trails have to be forged through litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| If those are the paths that need to be taken, half of my office is already under the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:11| I can't go and spend juvenile court clerk salary dollars without seeking permission, doing line item transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| and it opens up the process for a legal forum that's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| It doesn't have the perception that I'm running back down the hallway to a judge and going back upstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| and getting a handshake deal and coming back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Not that that's specifically the way it happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| but that's the perception as far as what I'm hearing from other community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| And I think it's time that this county move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| That's my opinion, but I think this is a good step to take to assure taxpayers that we're not spending money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:53| without opening the doors and letting them in to see what we're doing before we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| before we commit salary dollars, before we have somebody on the job receiving retirement funds, insurance funds and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| But I just want to let you know, one of the most important statements in Jordan to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| specifically addressed citing older case law to the Article VI officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| specifically the circuit and criminal court clerks in the state, was that we are still county officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| If there's a vacancy in our office, you feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| We are still running for office in Knox County and asking permission to hold these offices in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| Knox County is a charter form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| We're Article VI officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| The charter isn't authorized to limit our terms in office, but we come to you to ask for our operating budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| We travel under the procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| When I want something, I have to go and see that it's bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| So, sure, there are some unanswered questions in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| You know, do I have to comply with the county procurement code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| It's built into the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| I'm not a charter officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| But logic would assume that I'm coming to this body to ask for your funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| I should be following your rules as opposed to, say, the state procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| That's not in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| It hasn't been dealt with specifically black letter, but that's how we've been doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| So, yeah, some of this may have to be forged through litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| but we're at a point where this county needs to move forward and progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| Take this year as the ordinance contemplates, as the resolution contemplated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| to iron out everything legally that needs to be done, whether it's through legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| whether we make sure that the ordinance process is the appropriate way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| This has a fail-safe in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| It doesn't take immediate effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| It gives us time to come to the table or go to the legislature and get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| You know, the old Virginia Slim cigarette commercial said you've come a long way, baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| I think we have come a long way in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| It's amazing, when I'm just sitting here thinking today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| how much more information is available to us than it was two-and-a-half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:25| two-and-three-quarter years ago when I came on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| Virtually every one of these offices, well, all of these offices, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| have monthly reports online that are not only available to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| but I'm sure they're on their websites online, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| if John Q. Public wants to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Are those on your own websites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| And I'm sure they're probably on the others, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| So we talk about transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| There's never been a time in the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| and I've been around longer than anybody sitting up here on this stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| that I've seen it any more transparent than it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| You know, sometimes you can throw the baby out with the bathwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| and try to say, okay, well, maybe we need to go to court and test this out to see, is it necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:27| We have, as has been said several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| some of the best qualified elected officials in these three offices that we've had in my remembrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:40| But, you know, like us, they're also term-limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| The bar has been set for these offices now, and anybody who runs for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| if they don't meet the qualifications and up to the standards that these folks have set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| they're not going to get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| So, you know, I think we were just ---- I'm not sure where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:08| But I think we've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| They're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| And it's past supper time, so I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:20| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3861)|

| 1:05:20| Seven yes, three no, and one absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| Yes, we'll do the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| It was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Okay, this resolution was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| It's Resolution 803, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| selecting beginning and end dates for the acceptance of resumes from qualified individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| in accordance with state law to serve as state senator District 6 until the election to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| determined by the governor of the state of Tennessee as a result of the vacancy left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| by State Senator Jamie Woodson in providing for a public hearing date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| Commissioners, I want to suggest that we go ahead and start accepting any resumes immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| from anyone who is interested and that we accept them through close of business May the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| That gives us three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| Mr. Law Director, as far as having a hearing to interview those people, until we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| vacancy, is it really proper for us to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| I would wait, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| You could, but in anticipation of, but we still have to determine what the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| is actually going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| If the governor has plenty of time, he could actually call the election for next year or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| he could make it a conjunction with a local election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| But at the minimum, I think you should start collecting these and if we get a definitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| date, then you're ready to set a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Well, I'll throw that out just as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| Accept the resumes, but then wait until we have a definite vacancy before we have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| type of hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| You know, the only thing I would suggest is rather than setting an end of the May deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| in other words, we're closing it before the office is even vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| It's just let's make that at least take it up to a week or two past or at least at minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| up to when she resigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| I mean, we're closing the application process before the office is even vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| So just start, maybe start now receiving resumes and say until there is a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| I think we could say we'll start receiving them and then maybe, I mean, shoot, shoot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| we've even got a month or two to decide when we want to set the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| This actually related to our previous topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| I wanted to go ahead and set a date for a meeting regarding the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| While it was still the topic, I would like to suggest the first Wednesday in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| If we could, let's finish this first and then we'll come right back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| You know, I'm the law director's nearest chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| I guess what I'd like to put out there are the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| It would be great to get the requirements out today in TV land as well as posting something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| on the website, especially since we're going to have this extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| The more we let folks know if they qualify or not qualify, you know, the less time of theirs we'll take up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| potentially, and the more streamlined we can do this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| So I don't know what the law director knows the requirements right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| They're in the resolution, but they have to live in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Is there a time period for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| That was going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Oh, the time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| As far as living in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| At this time or at the last election or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| I think if memory serves, at the time of appointment, they have to be living in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| I'll verify that and give that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| I think it's swearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| With appointment, it's swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| They have to be at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| But I'll make sure you have the particulars for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Mr. Grider, I hate to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Would you ask, could we put this on the front page of the website, Knox County website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| just the fact that resumes are being accepted and what those qualifications are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| If you would check with your boss and make sure that that's okay, if we could get that posted, we would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| So basically we're saying that we'll begin accepting resumes now until there is a vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| but we're not going to set a date on any type of public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| Okay, so we're accepting resumes now until further notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4176)|

| 1:09:59| Okay, line item transfers are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| Now, before we get to PBA, Commissioner Broyles had asked about a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| You had said the first Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| First Wednesday of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| May the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Jolie, can you check and see if the rooms are available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| So we won't know the answer to that until tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| So we'll check and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| And if not, you can give us a couple of alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| Like after lunch or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| It doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| I drop Avery off at Mother's Day out at 9.30 and I have to pick her up until 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| So any time during that block is good for me because I don't have to worry about child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:45| What, the 3rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| Is that May the 3rd or May 2nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| May the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| I thought it was May 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Mr. Grider, is the mayor's budget message May 2nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| What time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4258)|
| 1:11:06| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Jolie, if you would, let's check on May 2nd, 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Let's check that week and see when this room is available and we'll get back with everybody on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| But we will set that time and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| Next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| We have one item left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| Item number 40, discussion regarding the purpose, scope and authority of the oversight of the public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| Mr. Brown, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| I'll do it from down here if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| Is it legal down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Please take your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| No, it is legal down there, Commissioner, if you'd like to stay down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Okay, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| We can't hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| He's been wanting to get on my case all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| Dale passed out at one of our breaks earlier this week on PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| In the interest of time, I think it would be, I just spoke with Dale, that we have a week to look this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| We'll have more questions after looking through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| We'll be able to do this Monday at an easier pace and have more questions where you can have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| So if nobody has any objection, I mean, I know we deferred it, you know, before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| but I would like to do that Monday rather than today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| Mr. Gallion and this lady's here, and I think they've been very patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Could we take it a happy hour or something to make up for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| Is this what you were here for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Is this what you were here for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Where were you once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| So you want to wait until Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| That's what I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| I'd make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| I'd second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Okay, motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| We'll refer it to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| I just think that gives us more time to look this over, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| what questions you don't have now, you may have more come Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| I just wanted to mention that the usual monthly meeting between the meetings at the Tom Warp Tea Room will take place Friday at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:24| That is Good Friday, but that's also the day that Dr. Briggs is off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| and he specifically requested that day and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| So that's where we'll be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part2?start=4411)|
