| 0:12:37| What actually took place was the regular clerk, we've been understaffed since before COVID, so we were struggling with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=757)|
| 0:12:46| She needed a break, so the cook come up to the register for the meeting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| She just didn't know enough to check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| It was a Monster Beast energy drink that has alcohol in it, which she mistaken to be an energy drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| She did ask for the ID, but she didn't get the numbers right, and she rang it up wrong and made the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=782)|
| 0:13:12| She's not actually a clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| She was just stepping in for a few minutes while our clerk took a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| She's actually our cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Do we have any questions from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=810)|

| 0:13:35| Was she legally able to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| No, sir, she's only been employed a week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| We haven't had time to, I mean, she was just filling in while the other clerk that is went to the bathroom and take a break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=821)|
| 0:13:49| because we're so understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| It was late after our rush, and everything's later in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| I don't have the exact time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| He'd maybe tell you the time, but it was later in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| after things had died down and slowed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| and she just wasn't familiar with the energy drink that had alcohol in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| So you're going to inform them that unless they go through that training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| they're going to have to call somebody else up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| I understand that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| It was just a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| We're struggling, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=861)|

| 0:14:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| So, in other words, you are admitting guilt to the offense of selling alcoholic beverage to a minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=864)|
| 0:14:33| She did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=873)|

| 0:14:47| Seeing no other questions, I'm going to turn this over to District Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=892)|

| 0:14:57| Good, nice to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| I would point out that your business had an almost 40-year record without a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=899)|
| 0:15:08| and I do commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| We always try to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Unfortunately, in today's work environment, we see these types of situations happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| but I'm sure you know this body has to take each offense seriously because it is a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=918)|
| 0:15:29| So, based on our rules and policy for second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=929)|
| 0:15:37| I would offer a motion for either, I believe it is a 60-day suspension or a $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=945)|

| 0:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| The question I have, how long does this stay on our record or take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| or will these two offenses be on us for the next 40 years, or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| I believe it's 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Thirty-six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| That one, the prior one, has it been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| It doesn't really matter, but we'll pay the fine, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| We have a motion from Commissioner Beeler and a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=976)|

| 0:16:28| And the clerk will send you an email to give you the information that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=988)|

| 0:17:21| officers with the Knox County Sheriff's Office Organized Retail Crime Unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1041)|

| 0:17:31| The defendant requested ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| The underage person presented their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| The defendant observed the ID and still processed the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1055)|

| 0:17:50| This was the clerk's third day on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| She did card the individual for the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| She just typed the number in incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| She had taken a beer class earlier that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| so she knew the correct procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| She just incorrectly input the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| and the registrar allowed her to go ahead and make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| All right, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Do we have any questions from any commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| Seeing none, I'm going to turn this over to Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| Just looking at your record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| it shows that your beer permit was issued on February of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| and then the first offense came shortly after May 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| So this is your second offense in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| What measures have you put in place to hopefully prevent us from seeing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| again in the near future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Well, we have each of the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1121)|

| 0:18:46| We do extensive training, let them watch videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Apparently we need to go maybe through some mock sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and get them to get more used to scanning the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| as opposed to typing in the number, which would be done incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| So the team member is aware, and she's been brought up to speed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| She is no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Well, this is your second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| so you have the option of a $1,500 fine or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1154)|

| 0:19:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1159)|

| 0:20:03| On 10-16-2023 at 20.38 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| detectives with the Knox County Sheriff's Office organized retail crime unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1206)|

| 0:20:42| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| You've heard the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| How do you plead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Guilty or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| I understand exactly what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| It's exactly what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| But thank you for including that last part of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| So I take it you're admitting to the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1257)|

| 0:20:59| But I also would like an opportunity to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| You asked a question a minute ago about what we do to make sure this doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| and I think it's terribly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| The guys that just left here, they said within three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| they make them do their alcohol stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1271)|

| 0:21:16| Our people have taken a responsible vendor program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| and they have passed it or they can't even get on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| No, you did say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| The one thing that our employee did write in the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| for which she's no longer an employee, I guess I should say that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| is that she knew by her actions, by her words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| that she had failed our policy, our training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| everything that we do to make sure that we do sell alcohol legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| She knew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| And not that I'm trying to, I guess I am trying to defer back on her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| but as a business, I mean, we hit this hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| We take it so seriously, and here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| Any questions? Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1329)|

| 0:22:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1339)|

| 0:22:25| And I know my colleagues are getting tired of me saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| but it's amazing to me that the state of Tennessee has made it so simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231113?start=1350)|
