| 2:32:27| I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| But I enjoy what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9149)|
| 2:32:30| I think that most people that serve in county government enjoy what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| and they consider it their job as a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9154)|
| 2:32:38| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| Cindy has also run unopposed, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| I just wanted to say I want to thank you for both your public service in the tax assessor's office and on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9162)|
| 2:32:50| And I want to say I'm probably one of the luckiest commissioners up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9170)|
| 2:32:54| because I have a couple of schools that overlap with Ms. Vetteri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| And she's the school board member that I work with on a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| And I really appreciate you being so open and working with me on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9180)|
| 2:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9187)|
| 2:33:08| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| Lee Trammell, 8205 Stratton Wood Circle, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| You know, we've heard tonight that just let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| Let the people vote on who they want to serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9197)|
| 2:33:21| They get that opportunity February 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9201)|
| 2:33:25| Each district gets an opportunity to vote who they want to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9205)|
| 2:33:30| It's not to be decided by a countywide ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| They do get an opportunity to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| Where'd Jim go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| Jim, they will have an opportunity to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| We don't need to set up here and deal in perceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| Let's deal in realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| If there is a county employee that can get his or her message out to the people that they want to serve, give them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9226)|
| 2:33:54| If the people decide that they want them, that county employee, to represent them, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9234)|
| 2:34:03| You have to be very careful when you throw a pebble in a pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| Be aware of the ripple effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| You're disenfranchising thousands and thousands of good employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9249)|
| 2:34:14| Some may never choose to run for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| But those that do, let them get their 25 signatures and tee it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9258)|
| 2:34:25| It's ridiculous to try to set in judgment on these thousands of employees that work hard for Knox County every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9265)|
| 2:34:34| And to imagine that they can't put the county's needs above their own is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9274)|
| 2:34:43| You're not sitting here making those decisions for my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| My district will have that opportunity to make that decision February 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9287)|
| 2:34:53| Voters aren't stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| Don't treat them like they're ignorant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| They know who they're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9297)|
| 2:34:58| If they do their homework, they'll know where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9298)|
| 2:35:03| It's not a decision for you to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| These are decisions that are to be made in every single district in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9305)|
| 2:35:11| They decide who they want to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| The fourth district may not want me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| But if they do, they'll know what they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9321)|
| 2:35:22| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9322)|
| 2:35:26| Mr. Hammond, this is going to be a referendum, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9326)|
| 2:35:30| The voters are going to pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| This would go on the ballot in August and it would take effect 2010, should they approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| It would be on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| It would be on this month and next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| You know, I'm for teeing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9341)|
| 2:35:48| I'm for teeing it up, as I've heard several times, strapping on the helmet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9348)|
| 2:35:54| Cindy, where's Cindy at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| Cindy, I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| You know, I think you're one of those that's the exception to the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9359)|
| 2:36:06| What really turned the tide for me was two things on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| Mr. Norman, with what Tony said, the political climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| I mean, folks, that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| And I'm saying this for the seventh district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| I'm telling the seventh district what I've seen here, what I see tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9381)|
| 2:36:27| And what I've seen the last year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| I shouldn't say this, but, you know, I'm not for any particular office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| I think for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| And you've heard me say this over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| I want commissioners up here that will think for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| Now, while the mayor was getting crucified over here, the sheriff and his people were just slapping each other on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9403)|
| 2:36:50| thinking that was the funniest thing that they saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9410)|
| 2:36:53| And every time something happens, we still have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| And, Tony, that's exactly what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| It's the political climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| They're back there just swaying and thinking, oh, wow, this is so funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| How is that moving Knox County forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9424)|
| 2:37:06| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| That is why I don't want employees up here that are pushed, that are behind other office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9427)|
| 2:37:14| I want people up here to think for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| And somebody in the supervisory position, that's too far up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| You've got a schoolteacher over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| No, I'm not afraid of a schoolteacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9442)|
| 2:37:23| But I think you get somebody that's higher up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| But, folks, bottom line, it's month after month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9446)|
| 2:37:29| You've got people in the back wall back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9449)|
| 2:37:32| Glad to have each other, making sure votes go the way that they want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9452)|
| 2:37:36| and getting on phone with commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| That is still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9458)|
| 2:37:41| Commissioners are leaving the room, going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| It's still going on, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| February the 5th, send us people up here that can think for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| that are not tied to any office holders, and let's move Knox County forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9469)|
| 2:37:59| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9482)|
| 2:38:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| I think I can count votes, and I suspect this will be going down even though I want us to be on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9485)|
| 2:38:11| and I want us each to take a position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| But let me suggest, and I support it, I believe that people should be able to make a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9494)|
| 2:38:18| I believe Commissioner Norman was right about the perception of conflict of interest as well as the reality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9498)|
| 2:38:25| But let me suggest, if this does not make it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9505)|
| 2:38:29| perhaps we need to come up with something at our next meeting that goes something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| that should a situation arise in which a person who is both an employee of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9513)|
| 2:38:38| and a Knox County commissioner is voting on the compensation operations or practices of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9518)|
| 2:38:45| or her own department, that that person should abstain from that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| Commissioner Luthold is doing roughly that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9530)|
| 2:38:53| I have tried to maintain a practice, even if a grant roughly touches on something involving the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9533)|
| 2:38:59| where I teach, I have been abstaining from those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| I think if we cannot get the ballot, let at least get that practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| So move forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| And I'll end with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| I've sat here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| You can catch people with their hand in the cookie jar doing things that they know they shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9556)|
| 2:39:24| And people on this commission look another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9564)|
| 2:39:27| Everybody look another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| We've got county employees that work hard and bring home less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| And people have got their hand in the jar taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| We passed something tonight where we can get $150 a day from developers and lobbyists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9578)|
| 2:39:43| and whoever else can take us out to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| And some of you sit here and think you've done something wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9586)|
| 2:39:54| And I bet the voters are watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| You know, it just amazes me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| It seems like it's narrowed down, especially you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| I mean, you're saying it's okay for a school teacher to run but not a supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9608)|
| 2:40:13| I mean, it's like, what are you all afraid of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| Why is everybody so afraid of Lee Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| Because that's what this appears to be aimed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| Now, if you all wanted to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| Now, honestly, there's working people in my district that would like to see no government employees up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9622)|
| 2:40:30| You know, we've got Mark Harmon over here, lives in academia, works at a university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| yet he makes decisions that affect projects, building projects that are going to affect poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| and I'm talking poor, people who make under $20,000 a year, will affect poor people's jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9642)|
| 2:40:49| That's what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| How does that arrogant little university twit sit up there and make those decisions that keep us from having jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9650)|
| 2:40:58| Now, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9659)|
| 2:41:00| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9660)|
| 2:41:01| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9661)|
| 2:41:02| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9662)|
| 2:41:03| You're hopelessly out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| Not personal attacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9664)|
| 2:41:05| Mr. Chairman, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9665)|
| 2:41:06| Please, everyone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9667)|

| 2:41:09| Well, I don't know why you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| Not with personal attacks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| Well, I'm not finished yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9672)|
| 2:41:13| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| Not with personal attacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| Mr. Chairman, you have the authority to make him stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| I suggest you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9677)|
| 2:41:18| Everyone will quiet down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9679)|
| 2:41:20| I can't, with eight people up here screaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| You know, we're going to be civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| Everyone knows how they're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| Let's just vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| Mr. Chairman, I was just given a personal attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| I'd like a moment of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| Well, let's forget the personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| I am only the second person in three generations of my family to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9696)|
| 2:41:42| My family was not poor, just broke, like a lot of folks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9702)|
| 2:41:46| And I resent Mr. Lambert's crass description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| I'm trying my best for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| And you should start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9712)|
| 2:41:53| Commissioner, please, let's go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| Turn your lights off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9717)|
| 2:41:58| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9718)|
| 2:41:59| A roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9719)|
| 2:42:00| Start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9720)|
| 2:42:08| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9728)|
| 2:42:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9735)|

| 2:42:21| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9741)|

| 2:42:23| Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9746)|
| 2:42:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9749)|
| 2:42:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9752)|

| 2:42:34| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9754)|
| 2:42:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9755)|
| 2:42:36| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9756)|
| 2:42:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9757)|
| 2:42:41| Does anybody wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9761)|
| 2:42:46| Commissioner Harmon, Mark Harmon, I'd like to put that in the form of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9766)|
| 2:42:51| I'd like to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9771)|
| 2:42:52| The idea I had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9774)|
| 2:42:55| I'd be happy to introduce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| And that did sound reasonable, unlike this measure that's before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9781)|
| 2:43:02| Would everybody wait until they're recognized by the chair so we can try to get out of here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9782)|
| 2:43:06| It's 10-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| Motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| Five ayes and five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9794)|
| 2:43:15| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9799)|
| 2:43:20| I think that it would be appropriate for Mr. Lambert to issue a public apology at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9800)|
| 2:43:29| I am not apologizing for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| And the point I was trying to make is there are hard-working folks out there that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9811)|
| 2:43:37| we don't want government people on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| But it's not Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| We need civilized people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| They want people who work in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| Mr. Lambert, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| Can we just get back to what's on the agenda for everybody, please, and let's get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9833)|
| 2:43:57| Well, I'm not apologizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| I didn't get to make my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9839)|
| 2:44:00| Don't apologize, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| You don't need to apologize for me for not letting me fully express my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| I'm going to say we're going to take a recess for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| Commissioners, take your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| Clerk, next item, 101 at the bottom of page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9853)|
| 2:44:18| Consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9858)|
| 2:44:22| repealing ordinance 0-07-8-101 and adopting a new stormwater management ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9862)|
| 2:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| Voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9872)|
| 2:44:33| Five-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9873)|
| 2:44:34| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| Five-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9878)|
| 2:44:39| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| Mr. Chairman, I will move to approve with the following amendment on page 11, section 3A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9881)|
| 2:44:51| delete the last sentence and replace with the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| The stormwater management manuals shall be enforceable consistent with the other provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9894)|
| 2:45:01| of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| That mirrors the city wording and Bruce said at the committee meetings that there would be no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9912)|
| 2:45:13| Mr. Weitrick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| We've also went ahead and sent that wording off to the city engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| They didn't have any problem with it and would recommend to their law department to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9919)|
| 2:45:24| and drop the lawsuit as previously agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| We talked about it in the staff meeting with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9928)|
| 2:45:32| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| They're in agreement with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| Mr. Law Director, you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| I received a letter today, this morning around 10 o'clock, from Morris Kaiser, the city attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9938)|
| 2:45:45| And he states that the amendment, as expressed, and he quoted it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9945)|
| 2:45:52| thus the Knox County stormwater manual shall be enforceable consistent with other provisions of this ordinance, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9952)|
| 2:45:59| And he says that the city is fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9959)|
| 2:46:04| Sounds like we're all in agreement then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9968)|
| 2:46:09| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9969)|
| 2:46:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9970)|
| 2:46:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9971)|
| 2:46:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9972)|
| 2:46:13| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9973)|
| 2:46:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9974)|
| 2:46:15| We're on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9975)|
| 2:46:16| Let's go to page 16, 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9976)|
| 2:46:24| This is requesting a report from the Metropolitan Planning Commission regarding a ridgeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9984)|
| 2:46:30| and steep slope development and protection by February the 28th, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9990)|
| 2:46:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| Commissioner Norman and I think both submitted similar ideas on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=9999)|
| 2:46:44| And what has happened is that on the city council side, there's been some interest on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10004)|
| 2:46:50| especially over in South Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| And I think we're really waiting for some sort of combined effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| Councilman Holquist is working on some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| But I think eventually, or fairly shortly, there will come before us some wording that we hope both bodies will pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10020)|
| 2:47:05| and we'll pay attention to ridgetop development and slope questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10025)|
| 2:47:11| Not from the point of view of total bans or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| but in terms of balancing aesthetic, economic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10034)|
| 2:47:20| And I think that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| I don't think I've left anything out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10042)|
| 2:47:23| Commissioner Norman, is that about where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10046)|
| 2:47:27| The MPC, and this is, I'll just read the wording that I've received in regards to ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10047)|
| 2:47:37| And, of course, it's all been precipitated by this water tower in South Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10057)|
| 2:47:43| Well, in the process, and we could get into the debate about that and whether it should be there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10063)|
| 2:47:51| But I like what is in this email that I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10071)|
| 2:47:57| The Planning Commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission, is directed to prepare a study of ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10077)|
| 2:48:03| and hillside protection measures, outlining the alternatives for new codes and programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10083)|
| 2:48:08| for the conservation of these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10088)|
| 2:48:12| In that, the Metropolitan Planning Commission serves as an advisory body to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10092)|
| 2:48:18| and to county commission on matters of use of land and sound development and conservation practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10098)|
| 2:48:25| And so, what we're doing is just asking the MPC to advise us that's their role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10105)|
| 2:48:30| that's what they are accomplished at, and so we look to them for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10110)|
| 2:48:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10120)|
| 2:48:41| Do you all still want the report from MPC, or do you want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10121)|
| 2:48:46| It would be nice to have a report, and we hope they so do present it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10126)|
| 2:48:53| Donaldson, you've waited about five hours, six hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10133)|
| 2:48:59| We're very excited to look into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| The date at the end of February may be a little hard to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10142)|
| 2:49:08| because we will want to take this through the Planning Commission itself and have them act and react to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10148)|
| 2:49:14| And the soonest we could get that to our Planning Commission would be their March meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| so it would be sometime after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| But we've provided that same language to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10165)|
| 2:49:28| and we're expecting some discussion on it tomorrow evening as well, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10168)|
| 2:49:34| Okay, we have Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| I actually wanted to speak with him a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| Is there any way that as we look forward and look at slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| that we can also look at somehow compensating people for the, if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10186)|
| 2:49:53| well, and I'll just give you an example that actually is me, my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10193)|
| 2:49:58| My grandfather bought some ridgetop land right after the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10198)|
| 2:50:04| That's World War II, not the Gulf War and not the Iraq War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| And he bought this ridgetop land as a long-term family investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10208)|
| 2:50:14| And I'd say there's a lot of families out there that are in the same situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10214)|
| 2:50:19| And what he said to me, and I remember playing his day when I was a kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| he pointed up and he says, we own that ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10223)|
| 2:50:26| And he says, now, right now, it ain't worth a whole lot, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| because they don't have the machines to work the land to where you can build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10230)|
| 2:50:36| But he said, one of these days, maybe when you're bigger, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| they're going to have the proper machinery to where they can work land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| So, essentially, what he did in the late 40s, early 50s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| he made a long-term investment in land that would be buildable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10249)|
| 2:50:54| when the technology became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| And, of course, he bought the land, made a sizable investment in the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10257)|
| 2:51:02| paid taxes on that land for all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10262)|
| 2:51:06| And now, you know, my father and my uncle and other family members are paying taxes on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10266)|
| 2:51:14| If we go through and say, we're going to make building on these ridges unbuildable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10274)|
| 2:51:21| is there any way that we can also look at compensating the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| for the loss of their investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| Because some of these investments, and I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| they're investments in ridge land that date back way further than World War II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10292)|
| 2:51:38| and old family farms where there's ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10298)|
| 2:51:41| that just now when the digging equipment is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10301)|
| 2:51:46| to flatten out the land and step the land off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| if we go through and say that it's unbuildable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| is there any way we can look at compensating folks for the loss of their investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| There are a number of ways that we can progress on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| And one of them is to allow development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| but allow it with restrictions that control height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10322)|
| 2:52:08| that control the amount of earth that's disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10328)|
| 2:52:11| and place some site planning conditions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10331)|
| 2:52:15| Another way is that we've actually been in contact with the Legacy Parks Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10335)|
| 2:52:21| and they are very interested in trying to string together ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| as a part of a park system and a greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10345)|
| 2:52:29| And that could involve compensation outright, fee simple purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10349)|
| 2:52:34| There are other techniques where you can allow the transfer of development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| from one parcel to another, creating a market for development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| that can be moved around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| Or you can, within a parcel, move development from one part of a parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10364)|
| 2:52:50| to another part of a parcel in a density neutral sort of a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10370)|
| 2:52:55| So we'll be able to report on all of those techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| and get those out in front of people and let them choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10384)|
| 2:53:05| The next item I guess we need to discuss is a draft resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| regarding a process for filling vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| Mr. Chairman, we have a lady who wanted to speak in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10390)|
| 2:53:13| You had mentioned public forum is the reason I mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10393)|
| 2:53:15| Ann Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10395)|
| 2:53:16| I don't know if there's anyone else, but she's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10396)|
| 2:53:18| and she's been here five and a half hours to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10398)|
| 2:53:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10400)|
| 2:53:21| Ann Robinson and then Tom Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10401)|
| 2:53:26| My name is Ann Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10406)|
| 2:53:28| I live at 2928 Selma Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| I've been a resident of Knoxville for 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| In that 45 years, I voted in every election that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10415)|
| 2:53:43| I came here tonight because I do watch your meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| but there's nothing like watching them live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10427)|
| 2:53:51| I've never seen men with less to say take as long to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10431)|
| 2:53:56| I don't know if your wife don't let you talk at home or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10436)|
| 2:54:00| but after watching the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10440)|
| 2:54:04| I noticed that a young lady was standing here at this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10444)|
| 2:54:08| She was African American and she was having some problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10448)|
| 2:54:11| with some of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| Mr. Lambert, you took it upon yourself to walk from your seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10454)|
| 2:54:19| down here and throw some hate mail on this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10459)|
| 2:54:24| Now, I marched in the sit-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10464)|
| 2:54:27| I thought that I would never see anything like that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10467)|
| 2:54:31| in my life in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| This was not something you decided on the spur of the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| You thought about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| You brought hate into this chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10480)|
| 2:54:44| And you said the reason you did this was to teach a black person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10484)|
| 2:54:49| what racism is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| Mr. Lambert, I have been a black woman for 65 years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| and no white man can tell me about racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10495)|
| 2:54:59| And I resent what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10499)|
| 2:55:02| I think you're insensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| And what I also resent is the rest of you sat up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| and did not say a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10508)|
| 2:55:11| You act like you threw roses on this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10511)|
| 2:55:15| The thing that happens with hate and prejudice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| is when good men and women see wrong and shut their mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10520)|
| 2:55:25| I don't think anybody would have thought that you were trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10525)|
| 2:55:29| to support the young lady who was standing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| if you had said, Mr. Lambert, you are out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| We are not going to have that kind of filth in this audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| This went on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| Did any of you all see what was said about Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| on the internet after this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| They call us a little hate country town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10546)|
| 2:55:49| Are you all a bunch of baboons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10549)|
| 2:55:52| I was angered and hurt by Mr. Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10552)|
| 2:55:57| but I was so disappointed in the rest of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| that you would let this go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| I am sorry that you felt that you had to bring this filth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10563)|
| 2:56:11| into an active meeting, into an active meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10571)|
| 2:56:16| not something personal that you took out in the hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10576)|
| 2:56:19| but in an active meeting that was on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10579)|
| 2:56:22| And I'm sorry that none of you all had the balls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10582)|
| 2:56:25| to stand up and say you were wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| I'm disappointed in all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10588)|
| 2:56:31| And the next time somebody has the audacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10591)|
| 2:56:36| to bring this filth and hate in this chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| please have enough nerve to tell them to take it outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| I don't know where you got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| What would he have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| Jump out down here wearing blackface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| eating watermelon and tap dancing for you all to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10609)|
| 2:56:52| that he had created a racial slur on this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10612)|
| 2:56:59| It was a racist act, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| That was a racist act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10622)|
| 2:57:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| Ma'am, ma'am, I'd like to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| Y'all talk about it after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| Let's get this meeting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| Okay, you took long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| Well, I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10636)|
| 2:57:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10637)|
| 2:57:22| Okay, let's talk about the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10642)|
| 2:57:25| regarding the process for filling vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10645)|
| 2:57:32| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10652)|
| 2:57:33| Yes, I had passed out a thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| at our intergovernmental and finance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| Again, there was no pride of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10657)|
| 2:57:40| The basic suggestion was is that we begin accepting resumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| to the commission office the 6th, 7th, and 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| I believe that Commissioner Luthold and I are of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| that we would like to hold the 5th district meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10668)|
| 2:57:50| at 9 a.m. on Saturday, February the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| at the Farragut Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| The reason I mention Farragut instead of here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10676)|
| 2:57:58| is because this room's not available on that Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| or I would have suggested we do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| But the Farragut Town Hall is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| They have agreed to put it on the cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| through the communications, through charter communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10686)|
| 2:58:09| and make that available to any of the media outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10689)|
| 2:58:13| So we would like to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| that the 5th district seat be that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10695)|
| 2:58:18| I do have calendars here for the main assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| and the small assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| depending on what you gentlemen would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| if you want to have it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| and if you want to know if the room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| But then the other part of that was on the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10710)|
| 2:58:33| we already meet for intergovernmental and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| Anything that we need to do to kind of wrap it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| could be done that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| The appointments would be at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| on Wednesday the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| with a swearing-in ceremony set for that afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10726)|
| 2:58:49| at about 1 or 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| The other thing that I had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| was on the 16th, on that Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| this room is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| and that we could, if the commission chose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10737)|
| 2:59:00| have some of the hearings on that Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| And my suggestion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| is perhaps we do the constitutional offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| here on that Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| So, again, I just throw that out for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| Okay, does any other members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| for their districts have a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| they want to have it or in the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| Mr. Chairman, I really appreciate Commissioner Hammond's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| I think it's a good outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| I know that Commissioner Pinkson wanted to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| that was exclusive to his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| And I was going to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| that Commissioner Strickland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| and I might very well welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| Commission 8 to meet with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| on that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| And I don't think, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10780)|
| 2:59:42| Commissioner Strickland, we can do it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| if that's to your liking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| or we can do it in Fulton and Little Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| I don't really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| I think here's probably more convenient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| for people to watch on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| Didn't someone say that CTV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| would broadcast it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| CTV will do it, yes, if we do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10798)|
| 3:00:00| If we do it away, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| if there were television capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| But 10 News, too, has agreed to do it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| And to keep the meetings at a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| I would just invite Phil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| if he thinks 8 wouldn't object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| to meet with us at that same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| And then, therefore, Paul can have the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10814)|
| 3:00:16| that's exclusive to the 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| that he indicated a preference for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| Well, I talked to Commissioner Hammond on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| and I don't care to have our meeting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10822)|
| 3:00:24| But the only thing, I don't think we need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10824)|
| 3:00:26| two districts meeting at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| We talked about having a gap between them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10828)|
| 3:00:30| or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10830)|
| 3:00:32| That's the only thing I'm thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10832)|
| 3:00:34| because they represent the 9th district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10834)|
| 3:00:36| and they've got us down as 8th and 9th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10836)|
| 3:00:38| and I want to know that the people out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| are from the 9th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10840)|
| 3:00:42| Okay, well, you can do it any way you please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| for the 9th. I'll trust your judgment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| I was just going to extend that invitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| now that the 8th, it can either go solo or join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| Well, you're talking about having it here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| Well, that would work better for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| because we're so spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| If you want to take Carter or Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| we'd almost have to have two locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| here with Tank and I, 1st and 2nd and 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| on Monday the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10864)|
| 3:01:06| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10866)|
| 3:01:08| Okay, good. That's just a little bit of tinkering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| I think that makes it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| Okay, let me, again, I have the calendars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| Mr. Chairman, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| The room is available on Monday the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| There is a meeting that is scheduled to be over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| with at 6 or before 6, so that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10880)|
| 3:01:22| The meetings could begin on the 11th here in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| Who's with us, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10884)|
| 3:01:26| 1st, 2nd and 8th districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10886)|
| 3:01:28| Yours, mine, Tank's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10888)|
| 3:01:30| That's on February the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| Monday the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| And did you say 6 p.m., Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| There is a meeting that is scheduled to be over at 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| so it might be 6.15ish, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| But if they're over a little early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| then we could, you know, you could start at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10906)|
| 3:01:48| And that's the 1st, 2nd and 8th district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| February 11th at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10910)|
| 3:01:56| Pardon me, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10916)|
| 3:01:58| Mr. Chairman, we'd also talked about parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| and we'd ask about the possible availability of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| in the garage in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10922)|
| 3:02:04| I don't know the logistics of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| but I know that we could park down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10926)|
| 3:02:08| But since it is going to be in the evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10928)|
| 3:02:10| and after dark, if we could work out something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10930)|
| 3:02:12| where they could park here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10932)|
| 3:02:14| I think it would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10934)|
| 3:02:16| Well, after 4.30, I think there are, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| 75 parking spaces on L3 outer deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10938)|
| 3:02:20| It's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| You have to file a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| Commissioner Ballard here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10948)|
| 3:02:30| You've got the 8th and 9th district meeting on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10950)|
| 3:02:32| It's 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| The 8th has been changed to the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10954)|
| 3:02:36| Well, he don't want to go that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| it's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10958)|
| 3:02:40| Yes, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10960)|
| 3:02:42| Would it be possible, is the small assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| in this room here both open on the 13th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| On the 13th, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| The small assembly room is completely vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10968)|
| 3:02:50| The main assembly room would be available at 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10970)|
| 3:02:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10972)|
| 3:02:54| We're going to change them both to 6.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10974)|
| 3:02:56| the 8th and 9th, and one of us will meet in the small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10976)|
| 3:02:58| and the other will meet in the large assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10978)|
| 3:03:02| But how can the commissioner see both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10982)|
| 3:03:04| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| How can we see both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| Well, we can have a 30-minute gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10988)|
| 3:03:10| and I'll meet right here if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| Yeah, we could just have them back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| But have a gap in it all right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10996)|
| 3:03:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=10998)|
| 3:03:20| But we're the ones going to be voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11000)|
| 3:03:22| And I'm sure you weren't in the 1st District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| and they're saying we need to put this person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11004)|
| 3:03:26| I want to be sure they're from the 9th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11006)|
| 3:03:28| when they come to my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| So you're wanting this main assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11012)|
| 3:03:34| it's available at 6.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| and you would do, like, the 8th District first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| and then the 9th District or 9th first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11018)|
| 3:03:40| and however you all work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| Is this open over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| Yeah, the small assembly room is open as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| Everybody here is going to be voting on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| and we don't think they'd be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| It's completely available on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| There's nothing in there in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11032)|
| 3:03:54| I'd like to go 5.30 if we could on that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11034)|
| 3:03:57| and, you know, take whichever district first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| whichever one you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| It doesn't make any difference to me which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| 5.30, we should be back over here by 6.30, I'd think, wouldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| Okay, we can do that if you want to do one over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| or if you want to do both over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11047)|
| 3:04:09| Do both in one place, make it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11049)|
| 3:04:11| I think he just wants the people from the 8th District over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| Oh, have a separate meeting, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| I mean, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| Okay, so 5.30 for the 8th District, then 6.30 or 7ish for the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11059)|
| 3:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11062)|
| 3:04:23| What I think he wants, to make it clear, is if the 9th starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11063)|
| 3:04:27| the 8th District people is going to sit over here until you all vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11067)|
| 3:04:30| then we'll come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11072)|
| 3:04:33| My question would be, though, the problem with that is how about as far as the camera set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| I mean, can they run the cameras over there and then immediately run over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11078)|
| 3:04:43| Are we not trying to televise these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| I'm trying to explain what Paul wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11087)|
| 3:04:48| What Paul wants is the 8th District people to sit over here until you vote on the 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11088)|
| 3:04:53| and after you vote on the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11093)|
| 3:04:54| We're not going to vote on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11094)|
| 3:04:55| We're not voting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| This is just a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| What he's talking about is we don't want the 8th and 9th people mixed up in ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11100)|
| 3:05:07| We want them separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| They not get along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11109)|
| 3:05:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| What I'm saying is we're going to have separate hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11112)|
| 3:05:17| that we meet with a gap between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| We can meet right here and the 8th District can be at 5, I mean 630,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11119)|
| 3:05:23| and then the 9th District can go at 7 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| They did run John Mill the way from the 9th today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11127)|
| 3:05:32| So you're wanting to meet here in the main assembly room at 630| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11132)|
| 3:05:35| and just block off 630 until you're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| Not in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| This room is available at 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11141)|
| 3:05:42| The small assembly room is available at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| Well, if they can get the cameras over there, Larry, he'd like to go at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11144)|
| 3:05:47| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11147)|
| 3:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11148)|
| 3:05:49| I'll check and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11149)|
| 3:05:50| But we'll either have there or here, 530 there or 630 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11150)|
| 3:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11153)|
| 3:05:54| The reason I'm saying this, Paul, because there's a ballgame now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11154)|
| 3:05:57| Whoever is last, that group is going to be hurting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11157)|
| 3:06:00| because some of their people are going to go to the ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| Well, not everybody goes to the ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11162)|
| 3:06:04| The constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11164)|
| 3:06:07| Mr. Hammond may have to leave then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11169)|
| 3:06:10| I have no idea what you all have just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11170)|
| 3:06:12| It's the men's ballgame, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11172)|
| 3:06:14| He's saying on the 13th, on that Wednesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| we start at 530 in the small assembly room or we start 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11176)|
| 3:06:20| And I think they can do the cameras in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11180)|
| 3:06:22| Okay, 530 on February 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| And who's going first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11186)|
| 3:06:27| No, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11187)|
| 3:06:28| On February 11th, we start at 6 and do the 1st and 2nd districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11188)|
| 3:06:32| February 13th, we do the 530 and we do the 8th and 9th districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11192)|
| 3:06:38| Are we going to put notices in the paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11198)|
| 3:06:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11200)|
| 3:06:41| Yes, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| And you're doing the 12th, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11205)|
| 3:06:46| Make sure all of this is perfectly sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11206)|
| 3:06:50| I'm trying to work off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11210)|
| 3:06:52| The 12th is not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11212)|
| 3:06:53| Neither of the rooms are available on the night of the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11213)|
| 3:06:56| City Council meets in here and the Sheriff's Reserve meets in the other room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11216)|
| 3:07:00| so it's not available on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11220)|
| 3:07:03| So when do 4A and B meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| About 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| No, we need a spot for 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11229)|
| 3:07:13| Commissioner Hammond, if the rest of the commission would like to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11233)|
| 3:07:19| we could do the 4th out there at Farragut if you all want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11239)|
| 3:07:22| or we can find another date to do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11242)|
| 3:07:27| Or if Commissioner Lambert wanted to do the 6th district there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| that would be available too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11250)|
| 3:07:43| On Valentine's Day, the room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11263)|
| 3:07:46| And on the Friday, the room is available in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11266)|
| 3:07:52| The small assembly room is available in the morning on Friday the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11272)|
| 3:07:59| And, of course, Saturday the 16th, this room is available all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11279)|
| 3:08:04| if we wanted to double up on Saturday the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11284)|
| 3:08:12| Can we change that time on Saturday the 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11292)|
| 3:08:16| Sure, you can do any time on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| It's available all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11298)|
| 3:08:22| Are you talking about for the 5th district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| No, the constitutional office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11306)|
| 3:08:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11307)|
| 3:08:32| Now, the 18th, of course, is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| But as I see, this room is available probably after 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| But that is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11318)|
| 3:08:39| And then, of course, we're here anyway on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11319)|
| 3:08:45| Tank, what do you want to do on the 9th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| Do you want to change the time on the 9th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11328)|
| 3:08:51| That Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| No, the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11332)|
| 3:08:53| The 16th is there from 9 to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11333)|
| 3:08:58| Were you going to put the 4th, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| were you going to put the 4th in there on that night, the Saturday the 9th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11340)|
| 3:09:05| You're still not going to put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11345)|
| 3:09:06| I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11346)|
| 3:09:07| It's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11347)|
| 3:09:08| There are some folks here that I saw that were running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11348)|
| 3:09:12| or at least live in the 4th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11352)|
| 3:09:14| Do they have an opinion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| It's not up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11356)|
| 3:09:17| I know it's not up to them, but it's the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11357)|
| 3:09:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11361)|
| 3:09:22| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| Well, I don't mind holding the 4th on Saturday the 9th out at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11365)|
| 3:09:33| If the rest of the commissioners want to do that, I think it would be a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11373)|
| 3:09:39| Would it not be easier just maybe to have it on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| and just do everybody and leave it like an hour apart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11381)|
| 3:09:44| Let's just have a special call meeting for this room here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080128part2business?start=11384)|
