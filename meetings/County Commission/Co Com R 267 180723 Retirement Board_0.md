| 0:00:30| Good afternoon. I'll go ahead and call the July pension and retirement board meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| Are there any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=38)|
| 0:00:45| For the record, we did receive Friday afternoon a motion to intervene on the objection of item 5 from Keith Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=45)|
| 0:01:08| We will note that once we get down to item 5. Any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=68)|
| 0:01:18| Item number 3, approval of minutes of the June 25, 2018 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| Everyone received revised minutes via email on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| That's the ones you're not getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=90)|
| 0:01:40| Emailed them on Friday. They came from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=100)|
| 0:01:57| Do I have a motion? I'll make a motion to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| Motion made by Commissioner Nystrom. Is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| Second by Ms. Foster. Any discussion? All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| Item number 4, request of Sheriff-Elect Tom Spangler to speak to the board about his pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=136)|
| 0:02:32| Thank you, Tom Spangler. 3016 Hodges Landing Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| What I would like the pension to do, and I think that I've already addressed it with the officers of the pension office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=156)|
| 0:02:43| is to put my pension on hold during my tenure as sheriff, and hopefully that the commission will look at that and approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=163)|
| 0:02:53| I have said that during my campaign, that I would not take more than what the sheriff's salary is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| and the state will not allow me to not take the salary from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| My other option was to go through my pension and put my pension on hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| and so I've discussed that with them, and I think that we've got that worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| so I'd like to address that with you all, and hopefully you'll accept that and sit down with Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| So if you have any questions, I guess you'd address them to him and or me, so with that being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=196)|
| 0:03:26| I guess my question is to our legal counsel, what is the proper legal motion to make to accept Sheriff-Elect Spangler's proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=206)|
| 0:03:37| The proper motion would be to allow Mr. Spangler to voluntarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=217)|
| 0:03:46| and revocably waive his monthly UOP benefit during the period of time that he serves as sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=226)|
| 0:03:57| That waiver can be revoked by him at any time and needs to be voluntary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=237)|
| 0:04:09| which it certainly is in this case as he's the one who initiated this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| Okay. I'll go ahead and make the, oh, we've got a couple other lights, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was just wondering, does the full commission need to approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| This is a pension board item related to the pension. I defer to legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| Yeah, I think this is a pension board action. This is not a commission matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| It actually would not be a, it would actually be a reduction in what we would pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| so I think if it was an increase in what we would pay, it would go to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| This would be actually a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| I understand. There is an item here, number three, that it would be revoked on his death or disability or resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to say that I appreciate this from the sheriff-elect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=297)|
| 0:05:06| I think it's honorable to see not only a campaign promise be followed through with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| but just the entire intention of what he's trying to do here, and I appreciate it as a citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=311)|
| 0:05:26| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| Is there a motion? Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| I'll make a motion that we accept this letter and intent of the sheriff-elect and vote to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| Motion made by Mr. Brantley. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Second by Mr. Webb. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| Item number five, applications for a retirement uniformed officer's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| Mr. Burroughs, do you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| As I have mentioned in months prior to other applicants' requests for UOP benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| to the extent that Mr. Wilshire's calculation of benefits will include leave cash out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| I'm here on behalf of Knox County and its taxpayers to object to the inclusion of leave cash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| Given the fact we have ongoing litigation on other participants and the plan in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| I would just ask whether Mr. Wilshire's calculation will include any leave cash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=398)|
| 0:06:49| At this point, Officer Wilshire's final pay has not been paid, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| If he were not to work another day between now and August 1, would he have unused leave cash out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| I don't know his leave time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| I don't have those records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| When he's paid his last payroll is when I know whether he had leave time or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| Would anyone in your office know that here today that could tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| We're not the payroll department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| His last paycheck will come between now and August 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| So once we get that last paycheck, we'll know if he was paid out anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| From a judicial economy standpoint, Ms. Bennett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| all I'm asking you to do is help me understand whether we need to name Mr. Wilshire in the lawsuit or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| and it would be to his advantage if you were to confirm he has no leave cash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| I don't know until I see his last paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| When will you see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| The pay date is July 27 is when he receives his final pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| Friday, this coming Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| Would it be acceptable to legal counsel for Ms. Bennett to confirm after his final paycheck is calculated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| to let us know whether leave cash out will be included in his calculation of benefits in the interest of Mr. Wilshire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=491)|
| 0:08:20| Well, we'll have to review that like we review all of your requests related to the privacy and confidentiality of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=500)|
| 0:08:32| As you know, we pointed to it many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| It's in Tennessee statute section 504 where it talks about confidential information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| If that information, which I believe is confidential, it will not be shared with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=521)|
| 0:08:49| I am making a formal request on behalf of Knox County to the chairman of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| to confirm whether or not Mr. Wilshire's benefit calculation will include leave cash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| I'm requesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| And I make that request to save all of you time and energy as well as Mr. Wilshire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| And I would assert to you that the fact of whether he has leave cash out included in his benefit calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=556)|
| 0:09:25| is for this board to know your obligations as a member of this board is to know whether it includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=565)|
| 0:09:36| because you're the one being asked to ratify the calculation of his benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| What this board cannot do is to knowingly violate Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| And we've addressed this several times in court already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=587)|
| 0:09:57| And this information has been redacted from information that has been provided before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| There's not been any objections to that redaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| And so that's where we're going to let it stand from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=609)|
| 0:10:18| I reaffirm my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| I don't think that was responsive at all because all I've asked is a yes or no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| And I ask you to disclose anything confidential about this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Motion to approve by Ms. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=641)|

| 0:10:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| All those there say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=649)|

| 0:10:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Motion made by Mr. Thomas, seconded by Mr. Radin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Report of Executive Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| The regroup conversion has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| We actually have our first applicant starting the process already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| So I want to commend Jennifer Schroeder, who has spearheaded this whole conversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| as well as a couple other staff members, Mitzi Mallory and Zach Cole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| for all the work that they've done to this point and coming forward to get this conversion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=706)|
| 0:11:56| A couple of changes that will be happening is, as you may remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| at the January-February board meeting we were approving all the verifications of continue disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=722)|
| 0:12:13| and are they remarried, do they still have dependents, et cetera like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| That will be handled by regroup and they are handling those recertifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| on the anniversary of the date that they were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| so they're not handling all of them at one specific date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| So that's going quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| That has already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| We also had, during this conversion, we had four participants who were in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| of using the Gen X service that UNAM provided related to the filing for social security disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=764)|
| 0:12:54| Four of the non-participants that were in that status were already engaged with legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| to appeal the actual first denial of social security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=780)|
| 0:13:07| So those four will continue with Gen X because of the position they were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| actually some of them actually have hearings this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| We didn't want to start that all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| So four of them will be finished out by Gen X, the service that we used with UNAM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| The remaining will be used by the regroup conversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| So we will hopefully have closure to those very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| And we are also starting the audit in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| The auditors will be here beginning August 13th to start the FY18 audit on the plans at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=823)|
| 0:14:00| So I think that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| Any questions for the Executive Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| Moving on to item number eight, report of the Disability Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| the committee that never meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| The committee that never meets met again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| And we've been keeping you updated on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| what we've met over Frank Brown Jr.'s disability in the past couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=865)|
| 0:14:35| We've met with him and he's come to our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| and some of his fellow employees have come with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| Just to bring you back up to speed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| previously when he applied for a disability, UNAM turned him down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| He appealed that and there were more medical reports, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| They looked at it again, took a second look at it, and they again denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| And so if you recall last month we were having the Reed Group do a good look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| and give us their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| And that came back, it's in your packet here, a letter dated July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=914)|
| 0:15:23| The Reed Group was in agreement with UNAM to deny the claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| This morning we met again and we heard from Frank Brown Jr. again and spoke with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=931)|
| 0:15:41| There was really nothing else we added this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| However, the committee did move this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| with no recommendation for the full board to make a decision on what they would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| So, Ms. Executive Director, anything else you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=956)|
| 0:16:06| Mr. Brown was there at the meeting this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| and we reiterated that the decision or the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| from both UNAM and Reed Group were the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| and it did not mean that he was totally disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| He just was not able to meet the qualifications that may be in place for his current job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=982)|
| 0:16:30| but he was potentially employable in other jobs that compensate on the same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=990)|
| 0:16:40| Mr. Brown was there as well as a couple of his supervisors from his department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| to understand that and that is exactly what has transpired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1006)|
| 0:16:56| The recommendations are in unison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| and Legal Counselor Mr. Mason also spoke about the situation at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| but the key thing was for him to understand he had to be disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| in any compensatable area that compensated on the same level he did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| and that was not what was found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| We told him he was welcome to come to this meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| I don't see him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Mr. Brown has been a great employee from the input from everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| that has supervised and he has worked with and a very nice gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| I think our situation here is that the definition of disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| and his condition did not meet up to the full definition of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| Some of the other committee members may want to add something to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| from actually meeting Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| If they have any input, this would be a good time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| I'll go ahead and chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| To be quite frank, this is a really hard one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| because Mr. Brown has really done everything that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| If he worked for me, he's the kind of employee I'd want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| because he's really dedicated to the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| and has done his best to try to stay with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| Unfortunately, what he's got is making it difficult for him to perform his task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| but he's not completely 100% disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| and there are jobs in the economy somewhere in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| that he may be capable of doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| which kind of makes it difficult to dispute what we've been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| by two different providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| The second one, it's my understanding, when it was reviewed at Reed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| more of the more recent medical reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I think the number they said was four different medical reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| had also been shared that weren't maybe originally shared with UNO at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| I said in that meeting, although we didn't vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| I made it clear that I thought emotionally as much as I'd like to see it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Logically, it's kind of a stretch to go against a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| of two different medical providers to grant it, and it's just tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| So I feel really sorry for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Maybe it would be a good idea if we asked Mr. Mason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| to read the definition that is in the disability plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| so that it helps people understand the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| The disability plan says that an individual must be, and I'm quoting now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| permanently incapable of engaging in any substantial gainful employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| commensurate with his education, experience, training, previous earnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| and utilization of vocational capacities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| regardless of whether a specific job vacancy exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| or whether he would be hired if he applied for work, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| This is Mr. Brown's final administrative appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| If the board denies his claim after this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| the executive director will send him a letter explaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| stating what the decision is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| and telling him that he can seek judicial review of this determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| He's got 60 days to pursue it following a denial by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| if that's the action that the board takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| I think that's the report we have from the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Mr. Chairman, I don't know if we take a vote now, or that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| Since the board sent back a recommendation of no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| does anyone want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Ms. Foster has made the motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Second by Mr. Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| Item number nine, report of investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| The investment committee's rates of return for the plans are in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| and as you study that you'll probably notice that the international stocks are mainly down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| emerging market stocks are down, and some of the large stocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| However, overall we're doing okay, but that's where the problem areas are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| As you review that, if you have any questions or something you want to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| now would be a good time to bring it up if there's any stocks you'd like to personally look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| Mr. Schoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Thank you, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Does Adam want to add any extra comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| So in reference to the international stocks declining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| trade tariffs obviously was a big, big topic during the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| and so that's why you see international returns lower than domestic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| Overall it was a good month for the U.S. stock market, so that's why you see gains from those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| Looking at the balances, UOP did go up, the other two did decline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| and the reason for the decline in DB and teachers was that disbursements outweighed contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| so that was not an investment gain loss, that was more money was paid out than what came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| Mr. Chairman, that's our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Mr. Rayden, you got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| So is there an option to add investments, like investment categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| like a total Vanguard, total stock market index?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| Is there a way to add that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| I'm sorry, this is on the defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| So the process there would be to bring that up at the next investment committee meeting for a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1417)|
| 0:23:45| What does that look like from a standpoint of 30,000 foot level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Is that something that happens a lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| As far as people adding or suggesting to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| Once every 18 months or so probably seems like that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| The committee has always been extremely amenable to consider funds that are brought to the attention of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| So I would say bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| It's a good group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Under item number nine, the status of the PRISA real estate liquidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Ms. Bennett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| The remaining 5% that was held back at the June 29th liquidation for PRISA has now been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| We have actually given notice to State Street to close all the old accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| and we now have the established new accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| Money is being transferred out and being reinvested as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| So I guess we can say, for the most part, conversion has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1484)|
| 0:24:56| Moving on to item number 10, report of legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| We'll start with Owings, Wilson, and Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| I'm going to pass the mic to my co-counsel, Chuck Burks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| A couple of matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| First of all, there's been a new lawsuit filed, Bobby Horner, and we need to file an answer on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| but we would need the board's approval for us to represent the board in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1520)|
| 0:25:32| What was that name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Bobby Horner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| That was the one that we discussed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| I discussed with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| It's in the minutes today that we knew it existed, but we hadn't been served at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| We've now been served with that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Which occurred with process with that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| Hearing the request, is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Can you give us the nature of that suit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| It's one of the UOP cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| It's just the approval of Mr. Horner to get UOP retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| and so they've added him along with the other eight defendants that already have been sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1570)|
| 0:26:18| I'll move to approve current counsel defending us in the new lawsuit as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| or representing us in the new lawsuit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Motion made by Ms. Hemelgarn, seconded by Mr. Rayden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| Also report that Chancellor Weaver has ruled to allow Edgerton McAfee to stay into the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| We had a motion on conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| He's ruled in favor of allowing them to stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| We are moving forward in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| We were in front of Chancellor Weaver this morning on a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| We have another hearing coming up on August the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| which, according to Chancellor Weaver, will either be the temporary restraining order filed by the Noss County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| or a bifurcated hearing on an issue concerning the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| Things are now starting to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| and we anticipate that this will continue forward at a more rapid pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1643)|
| 0:27:35| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Mr. Burks, what do you consider a rapid pace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| Well, as I said, we're going to have a hearing on the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| That is an expedited hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| I think the court, after that hearing, will set a matter for a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| I would anticipate that in the next two to three months that we would have a hearing on it based on his schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1673)|
| 0:28:02| I mean, I can't predict what his schedule looks like, but that's what I'm anticipating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I'm looking at the minutes from April 23rd of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| and I had a discussion with you about how fast or the estimated time that we would get this expedited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| and you said in the next three months, and that was in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| So on August 1st, are we moving forward to expedite this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| or is this something that we're going to keep delaying, delaying, delaying, delaying, delaying, and delaying even further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| Well, we argued our motion for the conflict back some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1716)|
| 0:28:45| We've had a couple of hearings since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| Judge Chancellor Weaver ruled on that motion Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| I got the order this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| So I think with that issue taken care of and resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| I think that opens the door for us getting this case further down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| That was a matter that had to be resolved before we could sit down and have the hearing on the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1745)|
| 0:29:14| So, I mean, I don't know what Chancellor Weaver's docket looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| It will depend on the dockets of the lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| but I think we could have a hearing in the next three months now that this issue has been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| But, I mean, again, I can't sit here and tell you for sure that that's going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| I'd anticipated that issue to be heard and ruled upon much earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| How many pages was that document that Judge Weaver released?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| I've got it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| I'd be glad to make you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| It's 15 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Have you read all pages of the document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I got it about five minutes before our hearing, and I glanced over it, looked at his ruling on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| I have not read it in detail just because we were before him on another matter this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1797)|
| 0:30:11| Is there any references in that ruling that say he – I think you're a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1811)|
| 0:30:29| Well, I think it's tough that you're able to give an opinion on a document without reading the whole 15 pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1829)|
| 0:30:40| because I think it's my understanding that there's some very, very interesting information there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| particularly I think on page 12, as I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| But I'm just very disappointed that in April we said we'd try to get something done in three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1852)|
| 0:31:03| and here we are X number of months later, and now we're talking about another three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| In the meantime, the retirees are having to pay for all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| So does anybody else have an opinion about the extent of where we are today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1875)|
| 0:31:24| Mr. Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Well, you all know I have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| I think this whole thing is absurd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| and we're just taking the money from our citizens and the retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| and feeding an issue that on both sides everybody's got – they're all stubbed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| and they won't talk, they won't work it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| and we had a great opportunity to do that when all this started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| and now all of a sudden everybody's lawyered up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| And it's probably going to keep going that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| and the people who are going to benefit are the lawyers until the judge rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| and whether he rules August the 1st or December the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| it just keeps going on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| And when it looks like we're getting close to a ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| then all of a sudden something else is filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| and we have to answer that or file something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| So I don't see any end in sight from what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| You don't either, because every month it's another postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| And that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| Well, if I could, one of the factors that I think is important in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| is the fact that whatever the ruling is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| it's going to affect not only the retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| but the other sheriff officers that are in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| And right now the only parties that are in here is the board here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| and those eight or nine officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| the other officers who will be affected greatly by whatever the court rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| are not even before the court at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| So that's a potential problem with trying to settle a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| and make an agreement that's going to affect those other 600 officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| if they're not party to the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| I understand, Mr. Burks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| When this started, we sat down with Mr. Owings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| and he explained the position for the board to consider and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Also the law director sat down with us and explained the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| and what he suggested that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| But since that time, we've gone off in splinter groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| and everybody's got a different position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| and they're looking out for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| And my point is we should have settled it back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| and we wouldn't be in this situation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| But everybody lost sight of an end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| and now we're in something that may go on for who knows how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Everybody keeps joining the fray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| So I'm very disappointed, and I'm disappointed in the board myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| I mean, we should have acted as a board on this some time ago, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| I would first ask, Mr. Burks, can we get a copy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| All the board members get a copy of that whenever it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| And it can be emailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Is there a way for the board to be kept up to date with what it's costing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2052)|
| 0:34:25| This entire thing is costing us for legal representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| and for any other expenses so that we have a running number of where we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| so that if we are asked by retirees or others that have say-so in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2076)|
| 0:34:49| by giving 20 or 30 years of their life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| that we can answer them responsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| and be good stewards of whatever we're doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| and give them correct information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Can we possibly do that so we can keep that up to date, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| I think the fee schedule has, I guess, most of that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| I'm trying to think when this thing started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| I guess I'll defer to Kim to talk about if there's anything else in those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| going up to the total for Owings, Wilson, Coleman, and Justice Noel Burks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2122)|
| 0:35:33| The fee schedule shows today, right now, because it shows all of FY18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2133)|
| 0:35:42| Okay, but that's for this year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| It does not include 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| There was no legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| There was no legal 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| So we're looking at a quarter of a million dollars already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| We're still stretching this out for another three, four, five, six months, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2159)|
| 0:36:07| Just a comment, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| We're not stretching it out, I guess, just so we're all clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| Pretty much we had a commissioner just say that it's the board's fault, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Well, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| We voted for a legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| They're doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| If their job takes today or eight months, eight years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| they're doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| I mean, that's all we can do, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Well, my suggestion for the board doing it is the fact that the board did not act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| except to appoint a legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I think there comes a time when you cut the water off before you drown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| and the retirees in this county are starting to drown on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| However, I'm a departing member of this board, so I've got one more meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| and that's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| Mr. Screenmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Also, the clerk and master can give us a copy of all the motions that have been filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| and if any of those appear that our legal counsel is throwing roadblocks to getting this before a judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2222)|
| 0:37:10| I think that will tell the whole story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| So I'll see if I can't get a copy of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| and have that distributed through the retirement's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| And then you can look through and see if we're throwing up roadblocks to try to prevent this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| because my impression was we were going to try to have this before a judge as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2247)|
| 0:37:34| and it doesn't seem like we're going forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| I would like to make one other comment, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| You're concerned about legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| That's a blip on the radar of what this plan is going to cost the taxpayers of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| if you continue to approve uniformed officers receiving pensions with leave cash-out included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| which was not contemplated in the charter amendment, was not ratified by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| That ought to be your bigger concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2297)|
| 0:38:26| Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| I don't have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| We've already talked about the items in other items of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| Item number 11, actuary block cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| The only item of note, I have a new granddaughter who's two weeks old, and she's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| That's all I have, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| The best thing I've heard all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Do you have information on the Denver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Yes, and I think we have a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Is that Doreen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| Did she email that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| We do have information on the Denver trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2354)|
| 0:39:28| We'll start on September the 11th, and we'll email that to Kim so she can forward it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| On September the 11th, there will be dinner that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| There will be meetings all day on Wednesday the 12th, all day on Thursday the 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| and then departure on Friday the 14th of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| There's a hotel nearby the Hilton, which is a Hilton Denver City Center, 1701 California Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2394)|
| 0:40:04| and that's one block away from where the meetings will be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| There will be due diligence meetings with the various managers that will include Oppenheimer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| Transamerica, Hartford, Franklin, Ivy, and Dodge & Cox, and Invesco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| So there will be a significant number of managers that will be present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| and making presentations to committee members who wish to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| Again, we found this format to be extremely useful for our clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| in that you're speaking directly with the firms that are overseeing the management of fund assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| So hopefully we can get a significant number of members of the pension board to attend the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2443)|
| 0:40:54| For those who are interested in attending, if they would let our office know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| and if you need assistance with travel arrangements or whatever, please let us know also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2459)|
| 0:41:08| On that Tuesday, the 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| USI, Jennifer Schroeder and I will be meeting at the corporate headquarters of Reed Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| which is in Denver, for a day meeting with them while we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2481)|
| 0:41:29| Item number 12, approval for payment and statement of account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Motion made by Mr. Nostrom. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Second. I assume he will garner any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out in the list of payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| that Director Bennett's legal fees for June is over $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2507)|
| 0:41:55| And are we back to making multiple phone calls to attorneys on the same day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| or can we not just group everything that you need to discuss and make it into one phone call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| So if you look at the bottom, we're on retainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| We got $10,000 on our side, and we're keeping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| If you look at the bottom, our payments are in the form of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| I'll send you a copy so you can go get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| So, if you look at the bottom, we're on retainer by both firms, so we don't get charged per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2542)|
| 0:42:39| phone call or per request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| The expenses that you see above are in direct correlation with the lawsuits that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| filed against the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| So Ms. Stackhouse is on retainer with the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| That's a different matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| We only have retainer for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I'm talking about this specific invoice that Commissioner Brantley was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| The 15 hours at $5,285.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| It looks like multiple entries on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| That does not necessarily mean that I spoke with her multiple times on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| She has to do her own research, if I'm correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2608)|
| 0:43:37| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Before we adjourn, I just want to back up for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Was there any indication from Chancellor Weaver that any other decisions or opinions from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| him would be coming soon, like I mean within a week, or he would not give you an indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2639)|
| 0:44:09| or he doesn't give anybody an indication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| No, he didn't indicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| I will tell you that we are going to meet again tomorrow morning to decide whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| not the parties can stipulate to some elements of the subpoena that they have issued, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| we agree or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| There's also a motion pending that he has not ruled on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| That's the motion to dismiss the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Then if we go forward, we have the temporary restraining order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| In essence, the county is asking the court to enter an order restraining this board from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| approving any more UOPs that would leave cash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| Those are the matters that are pending right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| That's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| I just want to make sure that when I'm asked questions about this, that I know enough of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2692)|
| 0:45:00| the information about this and I don't know how to get this unless we ask questions because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| I don't have anything written saying, well, this is what is coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| I'm just trying to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Some of that, for instance, the meeting in front of Chancellor Weaver tomorrow was set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| at the end of the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| It's not something that we had a week or two to advise everybody for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| He just said, I want you all back in here in the morning, tell me whether you can stipulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| to some issues regarding the plaintiff's subpoena to Ms. Bennett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2732)|
| 0:45:42| We objected to some of the broad spectrum of what they've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| That's kind of where we are at that point, talking about what we can and what we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| think we can produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| He wants counsel from both sides to get together and see if there's some common ground concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| some of these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| As board members, are all of us able to get any of the information or any of that confidential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2762)|
| 0:46:11| that we are not privy to, or is there any reason we couldn't see any of the information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| No, I think anything that has been filed in court, you all would be privy to, it's public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Again, I want to make sure that we as a board do the best job possible and are as kept up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2788)|
| 0:46:35| to date as possible, even though I understand that a meeting this morning turns into a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| tomorrow and it's impossible to say, let me go inform everybody, but as best as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| if we could, it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| We'd be glad to furnish the board copies of any of the pleadings that we file or any pleadings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| We can funnel that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Ms. Bennett, if you all want to see that, certainly we can do that, it's all public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Of course, we're aware of the concerns that the board has as well about the cost of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| the expense to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| In essence, I don't think we're driving the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| We're trying to respond to the lawsuit and protect the interest of this board and protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| the interest of the other officers that will be affected by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| That creates a problem for both Knox County and for this board, and that is to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| see if there's an agreement that could be reached without having representation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| these other 600 employees that are going to be affected by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| I think both sides recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| The plaintiffs have filed a request to have a class action suit to bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| That has not been ruled upon yet, and I anticipate the court will make some ruling at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2873)|
| 0:48:00| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| There are a lot of other things that are out there that need to be done in order for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| proper decision, and all the parties have the opportunity to be heard before this court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Mr. Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Just real quick, I just want to echo what Commissioner Thomas said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| We get a lot of requests from everyone about what's the status, how's this proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| Obviously not trying to turn over anything that's not public record or what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| in court, but we all are not in the courtroom, and I feel like that if this was a case that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| I was hiring a private attorney on a different matter, then I would be meeting with my attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| to kind of give me the, okay, here's what happened in legal terms, but here's what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| in normal talk, for lack of a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| Would it be too much to ask to, as we have these proceedings going forward, a small summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| that could go out to everyone of, okay, basically here's what happened, here's where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| and just kind of do that going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Not asking to spend more money on anything like that, and definitely not asking to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| over any sort of privileged information, but just a summary of what happened and here we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| are going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Is that something that could be prepared, or is that too much to expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| I don't see a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| What we have is basically public record, and we certainly could put that in a summary form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| to provide you all with updated what's happening, if that's what you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| We could give that to Ms. Bennett, and she could send it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| Okay, just so that we're all on the same page, and we're all thinking about the same things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| and there's no question about when, and when the next is, and all that, just a brief summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| There was a motion and a second, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=2986)|

| 0:50:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Is there a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Seconded by Mr. Webb, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723RetirementBoard?start=3010)|
