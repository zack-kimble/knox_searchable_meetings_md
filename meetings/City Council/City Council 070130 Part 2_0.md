| 0:00:00| that I say that it's not so much the who, but it's how and when those dollars will get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| out into the community. We have diverted our attention to the who, and now I realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5)|
| 0:00:09| we are in the same position we were in a few years ago, and that is a home for the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=9)|
| 0:00:16| a loan officer, but re-educating the public about where and how to access those loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=16)|
| 0:00:22| This cycle and circle continues to go around and around and around, and it will be 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=22)|
| 0:00:28| and we'll find ourselves almost in the same position. Therefore, in order for the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| loan, easy loan fund to be successful, there should not be a loan period for downtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=33)|
| 0:00:41| There should not be applications waiting in the wings for months and months. There should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=41)|
| 0:00:44| not be a lot of money spent on elaborate marketing strategies, but there should be adequate staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=44)|
| 0:00:51| loan approval board in place immediately, and the loan officer should have as much assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=51)|
| 0:00:56| as needed, or I would submit to you that this time next year, the businesses in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=56)|
| 0:01:02| empowerment zone will be no better off than they are today, and I hope that you will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=62)|
| 0:01:07| checking on that loan fund. My time is up, and I thank you for yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| Thank you, Deborah. Dennis Septon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=72)|
| 0:01:32| Honorable Mayor and members of the Knoxville City Council, my name is Dennis Septon. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| address is 333 Farragut Crossing Drive. I just want to make a couple of comments because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| I know the evening is very long. In some of these statements made by Mr. Martin about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| how the city approached the city or when the city approached the Urban League regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| this contract, he mentioned that the Urban League board was a little bit apprehensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| and that's true because as a board of volunteers who serve on the Urban League and who take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| our jobs and our responsibilities seriously, we wanted to make sure that if we got involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| with this program that, first of all, we wanted to make sure that we were doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| right things and if we were to have the opportunity to manage this loan program to do things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=132)|
| 0:02:20| Our board has a very good track record of being in a position where programs at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=140)|
| 0:02:29| Urban League are some of the most successful programs this community has ever experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| As I mentioned earlier, we serve on a volunteer basis. We take our jobs and our role very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| very seriously, and we hold both staff and each other accountable for all that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| Yes, there are, I would imagine, some questions that you may have, but I am convinced and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| I know that my board is convinced that if given the opportunity to manage this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| we would do not only the very best job possible, but you would see from us, I guess, the kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| of performance that this community has seen the Urban League render on other programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| in the past. And I have talked a lot, I guess, about our board and some of them are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| tonight. There have been sort of patients. I would like for them to stand up if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| would please, members of the Urban League board. And again, these men and women serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| again on a voluntary basis. We take our roles and responsibilities very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=202)|
| 0:03:32| We approach this contract very, very seriously. And again, I am convinced that given the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| capabilities that Mr. Martin has mentioned with the addition of Dr. Jones, and also the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| leadership and past performance demonstrated by Phyllis Nichols in implementing the programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| and also given the fact that the Urban League has at its disposal several, really, expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| throughout the country, the National Urban League has a vast network of examples of operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| programs of this nature. We can certainly tap into that expertise, tap into that resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| any time we want. And we certainly would do that, I guess, before undertaking this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you, Dennis. Mr. Talley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| If you would give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| My name is Thomas Talley. I'm 3114 Silverwood Road, Knoxville, 37921. That's the West Haven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| community. I'm a loan officer for Wells Fargo, so I know what it means to loan money. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=272)|
| 0:04:41| Councilman Brown had mentioned the CRA dollars and that commitment. And Wells Fargo is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| licensed as a bank here in Tennessee. And I think that's important to mention because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| we choose to be in the empowerment zone. I chose to work in East Knoxville. Our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| is located in the Five Points Shopping Center, which I'm sure many of you are very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| with. And since we have been there, we've gotten a lot of lip service from people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=305)|
| 0:05:14| the community. But one organization has stepped forward and really built a partnership with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=314)|
| 0:05:23| us because we're committed to, we are committed to really creating wealth in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=323)|
| 0:05:34| in East Knoxville. And not just East Knoxville, but all of Knoxville. But we're committed to help increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| home ownership and building wealth and bring business and life back to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| And, again, I feel there's one organization that has stepped forward since I've been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| and built a lasting relationship, and that's the Urban League. And they do an unbelievable job of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=351)|
| 0:06:00| keeping in contact with us, and not just us, but you could probably talk to every bank or mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| company here in Knoxville and they can tell you that. And I'm talking more from the home lending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| side, but they already have a network in place. They already have a great network in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| And I'm not sure what type of marketing campaign this body has envisioned and how much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| they're talking about spending, but they can pick up the phone and just call the people they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| And you'll have a lot of people in the community already that will know about the easy loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| So I am here a little bit to toot the horn of the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| They do an outstanding job. And, again, I just can't say enough about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you very much, Mr. Talley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Okay, I think we're back to council discussion. Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Thank you. We're all part-time members of council, but you're full-time, Larry Martin's full-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| and Madeline Rojero's full-time, and have been involved in the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| And, you know, folks disagree about things. As Councilman Brown said earlier, you disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| you move on, you work together in the future on different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Do you all have confidence that this is the best option right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| I think we do. Larry, you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Councilman Frost, we do. We've spent a lot of time, as you know, as all of council knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| since mid-fall working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| And I feel very good. I think Madeline feels very good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| She joined the effort late December. We have really spent a good bit of time about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| Quite frankly, we were impressed with the Urban League's approach to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| the due diligence that they applied to this, their very serious approach to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| They didn't just say, oh, yeah, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| They went about this very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| That demonstrated to us not only their seriousness about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| but what I think bodes well for us in their implementation of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| and for that matter, the governance and oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| And so those conversations and discussions along the way have been very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| It's been very helpful with Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| While, as Vice Mayor Brown has said, we haven't agreed on every point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| but we have certainly found some things that we do agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| and we have talked about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| We share the concern about the P&I Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| and we've had good discussions with them about their governance and representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| And I have to tell you also that the P&I Board, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| stepped up to their responsibilities a week ago tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| They practiced governance relative to the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| They heard the city out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| They listened to our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| They had lots of good questions, and quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| some of their questions led to some things that we then tried to incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| in what we're proposing to council tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| So I think we're making progress there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Vice Mayor Brown sensitized us to how we approach the loan committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| and the loan committee's role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| That is going to be incorporated into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| We've talked about the separate branding, calling it the Empowerment Zone Small Business Loan Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| managed by the Urban League, which it truly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Now, we disagree here, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| We think there's a lot of synergy in moving the loan officer over to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| There's a lot of support structure, receptionists, people to answer the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| places for applicants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| We just think that flows better, works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| To speak to the 90-day performance, you know, in all honesty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| it would have been far better had we had all of that worked out for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| but the truth is we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| We've agreed in good faith with the Urban League that this has to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| that we have to frame how success is measured here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| There are certainly information available to us out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| a lot of due diligence we want to do in that regard to really zero in on how we frame that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| Does that mean we're dead in the water until that's done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| We hope to be active as soon as we can get the loan committee set up and we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=622)|
| 0:10:31| We're excited about the fact that there's $600,000 in loans roughly that are in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| They're at various stages along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| And our intent is to get this up and running ASAP, to come along and amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| We're going to go through the process with P&I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| We'll be back to you to really frame and put in place what the performance measures are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| We think that will be a better product at that point, and we'll be able to measure success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| Again, we've got a short-term objective to get the money out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| a long-term objective to get it self-sufficient by the end of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| Madeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| I would just add that I agree with Ms. Porter that we need to get the dollars out as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| and that 90 days is really the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| You know, I'd love to bring something back much sooner than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| but we wanted to just make sure we had enough buffer that if it took longer that we would have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| But our goal is to get this going as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| But we want to do the due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| We want to know that the loan committee itself needs to have clear criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| And all of us, I think, want to make sure we don't repeat some of the stuff that's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| We want to make sure that we agree what success looks like, given the nature of these loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| It sounds like to me that everybody agrees on the destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| We're just wanting to take maybe different routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| I mean, the administration, it sounds like to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| has got every confidence in the Urban League that we're going to be able to have this program done successfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| considering the guidelines and the parameters that they've been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| But as Vice Mayor has said, we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| The issue is how do we get the most money out into the community in the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| So you're right, we agree on that, that we're talking about the method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| We've got some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| I never hardly ever jump in over lights, but I just want to make it real clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| because we keep catching this as if I'm saying the Urban League cannot do what it's saying it's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| I'm saying there is a better way that we can do the contracting opportunities and the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| and all these wonderful things that they're going to do from a business development support avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| and yet still not move one man across the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| And that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| We can still do everything else that's in that contract, and so that's what I'm talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| not about whether or not they can do it, whether or not they've got the capacity, whether or not they're competent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| And I keep hearing responses that sound like that's what I'm implying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| I want to make it very clear that's not what I'm implying with what I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| I'm going to go to Ms. Roddy next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| I'm not sure what the lights are, but I'll go to Ms. Roddy, and we will get everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| I don't think that I need to repeat the reasons why I support this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| I think it's an excellent proposal, and I think that Mr. Martin and Ms. Rojero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| and Mr. Upton and Mr. Talley all made some excellent points as to why this proposal has synergy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| and makes sense for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| What I'd like to come back to is the workshop that we had about this a number of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| and there's a date that stands out in my mind, and that was the 31st of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| And this council made it very clear that we were going to hold the administration's feet to the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=821)|
| 0:13:50| on that deadline, that we wanted action on this P&I loan fund by the 31st of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| It's basically been out of business since last July when EVI's work was suspended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| and I think we all agree that we want to see this money get out in the community to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| that need it most as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| And as Councilman Frost said, we're part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| It's not our job to research the solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| It's our job to understand the solutions and make sure that they're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| And I'm convinced this is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| It's the 30th of January today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Tomorrow's the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| I'd like to see a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| I can't support postponement, and I'd like to see this proposal go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| I guess I actually pretty much agree with everything Ms. Roddy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| I kept thinking about turning my light off as she said pretty much everything I wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| and I guess I just will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| No luck with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| I had to say that I wasn't going to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| I'm stunned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| I'm not sure if I can talk now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Well, I don't know if I can follow that action, so I'm going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| I talked with Mellon Rojero at some length last week about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and expressed my concerns about the pipeline of accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| and reporting in terms of what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| that coming back to the city through her organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| and being available, of course, to Council as well so we can monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| After that conversation, I have a lot of confidence in this approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| and in the Urban League taking this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| I think the Urban League is a quality organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| I would hope I heard Mr. Talley talk about their existing network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| their strong network, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| I don't know if that network extends into all of the empowerment zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| and that would be one of my concerns, and I would speak to you as Urban League Board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| and, of course, as the Loan Board is put in place and comes on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| I think that's going to be really critical that they address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| I represent South Knoxville, a good bit of which is in either the South ZAC or the Central ZAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=966)|
| 0:16:14| I also represent Fort Sanders, and that is in the Central ZAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| I know historically it's been very difficult for people in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| to plug into any component of the empowerment zone, whether it's a loan program or any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| And so I would hope that the access would be clearly established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| the networks would be built if they're not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| and any marketing would reach out to those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| And so I just wanted to go on record as saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| But with that caveat, I agree with Councilman Narati that I do think we need to move ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:50| and I put a lot of confidence in the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| and I also put a lot of confidence in Ms. Rojero and her team and Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| But also with that confidence goes some pretty high expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| in terms of holding their feet to the fire, as was said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| So with that, I think I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Thank you. I'm going to go to Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| I'm not quite sure what the order was, but Councilman Woodhull, and then we'll come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| I agree with what I hear Councilman Narati, what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| It seems like a good proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| But I also, in my conversations with you, Councilman Brown, admire your insight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| that you and I have talked a lot about issues in the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| We both work on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| And I also don't hear people questioning your opinion of the Urban League at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:56| And you and I, every time we've talked about the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| you've been nothing but complimentary of them, even behind their back in closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| And I hear you always trying to focus on how to be effective in empowering the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| And getting money to people is no easy matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I do want to hear what you put some thought into this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| What are the weaknesses of the current proposal on the table that you think that your proposal is addressing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Let me tell you very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| I think that one of the weaknesses on the table is with regards to the whole question of performance measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:46| evaluation, and who's going to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| If that's the P&R Board, that spins into what I think with regards to the P&R Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| and how it should be structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| You know, I think one of the weaknesses on the table right now is while I hear lending institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| I want to hear lending institutions being involved in a loan fund and the Empowerment Zone Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| not just lending institutions, but those nontraditional lending institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| I'm talking about lending organizations like mortgage companies like Wells Fargo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| These folks are spending time loaning in the Empowerment Zone and places like that and have an expertise for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| There should be a place on maybe this loan fund program and also maybe on the EZ Board for somebody from the credit unions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| They play a very viable role in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Having East Knoxville, you know, with regards to the Knoxville Federal Teachers Credit Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| who has offices all across Knoxville, and also ORNL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| You know, there are a lot of other ways and institutions that we're not thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| What this proposal also does is talks about bringing the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Chamber Partnership to the Board of the Empowerment Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| not in a voting capacity, but in a non-voting capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| And by expanding it to 12 people from the community and three resource folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| you actually have community people who are voting on issues and programs as it relates to the Empowerment Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| If the loan fund is actually going to flow under the Empowerment Zone and into its Board of Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| then you still have the community individuals who are ultimately hearing the results of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| I think also one of the things that I hear here is, and I don't see the trigger date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:28| and I respectfully disagree with a couple of points made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| And while we said we would hold the administration's feet to the fire on January 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| I do not think what we have before us puts us on goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| What we do have before us is a contract that says move Felix Harris across the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| but we just heard 60, 90 days before they can operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| So we're still on goal in putting these dollars out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| We're on January 31st, but we're not on goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| And the reason we're not on goal is because we still have issues to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| So while the administration has met the deadline of coming to us on January 31st with a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| we still are not on goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| And even if we approve this tonight, let's be very clear that tomorrow a loan is not going to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| because you still have some of these things to be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| You still got 60 to 90 days, so let's be real clear and understand we're approving this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Let's not think there's loans tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| So what my proposal also says is since we have that time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| why don't we talk about the Empowerment Zone Board and make sure that the Loan Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| has people that are representative of the Empowerment Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Why don't we make sure that this process is one that is a holistic process and not a piecemeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:44| So, you know, I have yet to hear, well, I'll get to the specific contract parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| but those are some things that jump out at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| And I've got some specific questions about the contract that maybe once I hear answers from Larry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| and Madeline, maybe they'll resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| But that's what I think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| It broadens the Empowerment Zone Board, suggests we look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| You know, somebody says, well, how do you come up with the two people from the geographic areas of the ZACs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| Well, the ZACs aren't currently operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| But an idea to start with is like this council has done many, many times before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| You know, let it come from council members in whose district those ZACs reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| And they know the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| They know the people who are involved in ZACs and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| here are the suggestions to COIN or to P&I or to the new Empowerment Zone Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| on folks to get this thing going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| I also think that respectfully disagree that it is our job to research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| We do it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| We do it on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| We go out and drive and drive down the street and drive down the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| And we talk to the neighbors and we see if it's a narrow street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| We look at a lot of setbacks and lines and drawn and this and pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| And we do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| So we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| This council does do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| You know, we do that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| And I'm saying in this situation, let's take the opportunity to do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| Let's take the opportunity to do a thorough look here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| You know, they could still be working on developing the performance measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| as we wait 30 days to sign this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| If they're going to take 60 or 90 days to put those together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| it doesn't stop them from moving forward one hour older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| But what it does do if we close this door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| now it keeps us from maybe having a discussion about can we find a better way to fund the loan fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| I think that's a great idea, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Can we talk to and convince some lending institutions to come on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| and help fund the loan officer and take that dollar figure out and put it out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| So kind of some of my thoughts, a little rambling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| but I'm passionate about it because I see an opportunity for this council to really make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| hopefully, that we maximize the next two years we have to 09| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| And Senior Director Deputy Mayor Martin is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| We're on a short time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| But if we still have 60, 90 days before this whole pie is put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| and they still got to come back to us to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| why not take that time to make sure and give some other thoughts to the overall empowerment zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| of what we're going to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| I see this council do it all the time to postpone things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| and make sure that we've got everything in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| And that's all I'm suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| I'm going to let you come back with your specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| We'll go to Ms. Pelow and then any other comments, then we'll come back to your specific questions, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Well, my light's been on so long now that everyone has pretty adequately made comments that refer to the points I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1463)|
| 0:24:32| I'm going to confess to you that when I first saw this proposal, I was not excited about it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:42| But I certainly appreciate Ms. Rojero being in touch with me and we had a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| She made some points that were very important to my making a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| And, you know, we've kind of, I'm just going to say we've kind of messed up in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| And I just have a great concern about not messing up in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| The time frame is tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| I mean, we all agreed to that, what, a month, two months ago, I can't remember now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| when we did discuss this January 31 cutoff or starting point, either way you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:23| And in my mind, that was an absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| That was not something that I was going to tinker with or wanted to postpone or wanted to play with either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| But it concerns me a bit that we don't have everything tied down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| I have to agree, getting the money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| I mean, after the report we had that evening, my goodness, there's just money that has not been out where it needed to be in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:50| with the people who needed to have that opportunity and advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| And I'm just a bit frustrated about, I just understood Ms. Rojero's comment about 90 days is the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1554)|
| 0:26:03| But, oh, my goodness, I mean, you know, I think that we're just on a treadmill here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| where we really need to be running hard and catching up with ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| because I think this council really had in mind January 31 we would be up and ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| and could feel better about a situation we're trying to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| Now, I appreciate Councilman Brown's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| This week I have had some messages from some people I respect very much on the P&I Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| And I will have to say that I appreciated their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| I appreciated their support for this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| That means a lot to me, because I respect the work they have done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| and I respect their concerns and their passion for this going forward in the proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| While I have a great amount of respect for the Urban League, I have to confess I don't have that much experience with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| So I was not, until Ms. Rojero made some comments and I guess you would say educated me on some of the work of the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:14| I was not aware that that could be a good instrument for operating this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| Frankly, I just really have the sense I want the city not to get too far from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| because simply I think, as I believe Councilman Hawkins might have said, oversight to me at this point is still so critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| So Ms. Rojero, she affirmed that that is the purpose that the city has at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:41| of staying very close to this program and its supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| So given that, I certainly feel a lot more prepared to make a decision tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| Now, I simply am concerned about if we postpone this, what does this do to the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| Because here I am saying we need to be the finish line so that we can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| So I don't understand what that's the one thing I'm not clear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| What is going to happen with this if we have a postponement tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| Can someone who wants to respond to that, Mr. Martin or Ms. Rojero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| Well, if you all postpone this, the contract that we have today with P&I goes out of existence tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| It ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| And so we are at that point in time totally out of the lending, not only the lending business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:37| but the managing of the loan fund at that point because we have no dollars allocated toward the maintenance of that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| Those all end tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Well, that was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| So, Councilman Brown, help me to understand your consideration for requesting a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:58| Well, all the things I said earlier, I mean, we can extend that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| It may not be before us tonight, but that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| This administration went months without having a contract with P&I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| So if you've got to wait two or three days and reconvene this council in a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| and say we approve that contract and extend it 30 days, it's not here before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| and that puts it in a strategic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| But right now what they're doing over there is kind of in limbo as it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| If we approve it, the more important question, Councilman Peo, if we approve it tonight, what changes tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| Well, I'll tell you what, in my opinion, changes tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| Somebody is going to help move a desk or two across a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| and move Felix Harris across a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| He's going to sit down in his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| and then they're going to start talking about what are the performance measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| I would add that Chairman Purnell of P&I has expressed to me that they are not in a position to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1790)|
| 0:30:00| on a delayed basis of having responsibility for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| And I appreciate you having that discussion with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| and us not having the P&I contract before us and basically telling this council, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| giving us no choice basically is what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| We have no option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| We have no choice but to do what you all have basically directed us to do, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| And I'm not going to be very comfortable doing that because we hear maybe there's no option tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| or we can't think out of the box here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| You know, I'm just saying that let's be real clear about approving this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| That's not saying a loan is getting made tomorrow or the next day or the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| All we're doing is moving a body and going to let this whole thing have to be negotiated out in 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| or 90 days when we could really be moving toward what I thought was everybody's goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| and that is to make sure that we have a successful, cohesive way about going forward with regards to all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:55| May I just ask one more question of Ms. Rogero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Because I feel I see a response that she would like to make to this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| if that would be all right, Councilwoman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| I would like to just address what would happen tomorrow or February 1st when this contract would start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:16| Even though immediately that means that the Urban League staff would start working with us on identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| and with Vice Mayor Brown and others who are interested in trying to set up this loan committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| identifying the sort of the profile of who this loan committee would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| and then starting to identify individuals, approaching them, getting their commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| and starting to set up this loan fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Also, we'd start the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| And Dr. Jones has got quite a bit of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| We will rely on him to work with us to start doing the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| to start identifying the best practices and developing the performance criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| In order, it's my understanding that when we move this over to the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| that we also have to get the licensing for the software that is used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| And that takes a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| We'll start, put that in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| We want to start the marketing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| And I appreciate what Mr. Talley mentioned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| there's already folks that are connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| And when I say we need to develop a marketing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| that doesn't necessarily mean we've got to spend tons of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| It means we have to identify who it is that we need to reach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| who are natural partners such as Wells Fargo and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| And we will start working with them and start developing a marketing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| We have to do things such as set up the money that's in an account right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| the existing program dollars that are coming in, the principal payments and the interest fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| There's an existing check-in account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| We have to set up new accounts in order for the Urban League to start accepting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| We have to contact all of the folks who currently have loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| and advise them that they need to start sending the money to this address rather than the prior address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| We need to start letting people know that this has changed hands and start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| In the meantime, we're setting up this performance criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| So any of that, if we delay this 30 days, I submit this to you respectfully, Vice Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| all of this stuff that we just mentioned will be delayed even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| I would suggest that the issues that you have raised about the P&I governance, we are in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| And as has been mentioned, the chair of P&I and many of the members of the P&I board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:39| recognize that they need to look at how they are set up and the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| And, in fact, we have a meeting set up with the chairman on February 5th to continue that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:55| And these ideas that you've brought about the governance, we'll deliver this to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| If you want to be part of a meeting related to that, I'm sure he would be open to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| In addition, like I said, the loan committee, we need to start working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| It takes a while to get people identified, to get them set up, to get them trained really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| to get them realizing exactly what our parameters and our criteria will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| So there is a lot of work that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| So February 1st, not only will we start moving FELIX over, but we will start putting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| we will hit the ground running on February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| We may not get new loans out for 60 days if it takes us that long to get the criteria together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| but we will be collecting loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Think about the loans that already are due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| and there will be no collection service going on for another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| That means we run the risk of increased delinquencies, possibly defaults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| We want to be servicing those loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| In addition, those who are already receiving, who already have loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| we need to start seeing what support services they need, what kind of assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| why put that off for 30 more days when there are people right now trying to make a go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| of their businesses with the existing loans that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| We can start servicing that right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| So there is quite a bit we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| I'm sorry if we left the impression that nothing would be happening for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| In fact, there is quite a bit to do, and we want to hit the ground running on February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| I'm going to go to Councilman Bailey, whose light has been on the longest, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| I had talked to Madeline today as well, and I came here prepared to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| And then I received this presentation from Vice Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| which obviously we hadn't had enough time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| And then I heard a compelling argument by Vice Mayor Brown on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| And I respect his judgment, and I know his heart and soul is in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| So that, to me, carries a lot of weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| But having heard this back and forth, I'm wondering, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| if there's not some things that we couldn't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| that we couldn't move forward and satisfy some of the issues you've raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| Do you think that would be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| And one thing I was glad to hear, a very fresh thing out of Director O'Hara's mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| is that she's going to continue to work and talk with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| So we are committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| Larry and I are committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| And with those of us who have been talking, we want to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| And respectfully, I would say 80% to 90% of what Ms. O'Hara just said needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:29| could be done whether this contract is approved or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| because a lot of it deals with performance measures, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| I don't know why we just can't let folks know you need to start making payments on loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| I don't know why we can't be collecting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| You know, it's very clear that folks support the Urban League, want a contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| So a lot of this stuff, I think, could be done anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| I'm just still, and maybe if we talk about a couple of these issues here on the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| I'm kind of restating myself over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| Councilman Becker, who is getting ready to go back on his word and have something to say now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| So I'm going to allow him, because he's been very good and hasn't said much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| and I'm going to back off and get to the contract, and then we can go to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| because I think people understand where I am and what I'm speaking to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and my concern that we're missing a golden opportunity to really get it all done right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| and get everybody on board at the same time and the ship going in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| and everybody on board instead of, you know, kind of leaving some folk at the harbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| hoping that they're going to get the right ship and catch up to us, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| The amended contract that I have, the performance measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| I'd be coming back to council in some form for us to know what the plan for how to run this right is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| Right, and it's how you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| I'm not sure that that's something that you vote on, but if that's what you wish, we can bring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| But it would come to you in a workshop or however you wish us to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| It also, by the way, goes to the governing body as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| And I think we've all sort of agreed that we're talking about restructuring the governance somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| I know that the administration plan is to keep it with the P&I board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| but maybe to talk about some changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Is that something that will be coming back to us as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| The actual, let me make sure I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| The actual changes to the P&I board you'd like to know about for informational purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| Well, I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| I think it is a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| I mean, I think the vice mayor brings up a lot of concerns about how we're governing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| And I guess my question is, is that something that this board gets to chew on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| Well, we certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Obviously, P&I is a stand-alone entity that has its own bylaws, its own governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| and makes decisions relative to its board membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| The prospectus, which is the governing document for us, along with the P&I bylaws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| we think supports our position relative to strengthening that board from a representation standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2334)|
| 0:39:01| We think we'll be successful at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| The early discussions that Madeline's had with them have been very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| I think with Vice Mayor Brown's help, we will get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| And I think that's very appropriate for us to come back and share with council what we have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| or better said, probably, what the P&I board has done, because it is their jurisdiction in regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:27| I'm going to go to Councilwoman Pelo and then to Councilman Horquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Councilman Horquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Well, what I hear Vice Mayor Brown saying about the governance side of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| and what Councilman Becker was following up on with the P&I board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| I share concerns, I think, maybe not exactly, but maybe, I don't know, with the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| I think those are critical questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| And whether or not we as a council have any say in that, we know that based on the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| and what's already transpired that the decision had to be made as to whether to leave P&I in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| under the existing agreements, et cetera, and the prospectus, of course, identifies that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| or to go with another model, another approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| And what we're hearing is leave the P&I board in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| But given that, I mean, I've certainly expressed my concerns about the board in the past and about P&I governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| And so I think we really do share a concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| And by saying I support moving ahead with the Urban League, I am not in any way minimizing those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:40| I agree with you that we need to be front and center about that and address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Let me just very quickly to the contract ask a couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| With regards to, and one is a housekeeping matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| In the past I've said this, so with regards to I guess it would be 1.6C, the reporting part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| typically if I request in contracts that when we have reports that from whatever entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| or contract we're dealing with that comes to the city, that also a copy be provided to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| And so I'd like to have that added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| And in the past the administration has always said, yeah, we'll add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| I'll put that in in the final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| The other one would be if we go to 1.1B, which is a real biggie for me, the performance measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:29| My question is other than the Urban League, who is going to be involved in identifying, quantifying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:38| and deciding on what those measures are going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| Is that going to be the Urban League and the city only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| Or will P&I have a role in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| That's a question that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Let me start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| And you're correct whatever I say wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| But the development of the performance measures would be the responsibility, we would hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| in concert between the city and the Urban League to do our work together finding the best practices out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:13| and, quite frankly, not reinventing the wheel, looking to some good loan programs that we think are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| and incorporating those into our approach here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| so we have a clear definition of what is successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| Now, we have talked about bringing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| This was an item that was discussed at length at the P&I Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| and we have committed to bringing that back to the P&I Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Now, one of your other questions, and I think Vice Mayor Brown, you'd asked this question actually earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| and that is the role of evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Evaluation has been brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| What changes with all of this is that the evaluation part of this process comes to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2572)|
| 0:43:01| which is what the city, quite frankly, has been doing all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| We had somewhat of a dual track here, a duplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| So the actual evaluation of the Urban League will be the responsibility of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| But in its role as governance, we have committed, and it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| and it's consistent with the prospectus that describes the role of governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| that we will share those evaluations as we will not only with this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| but any other Empowerment Zone program with the P&I Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| But the actual evaluation is the responsibility of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| Did I state all that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| I would just add, though, that as we are working on the performance measures with the Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| and with Larry and me and my staff, I am sure that they would be glad that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| but we have talked about actually bringing this to the council and it was just brought up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| Any member of council who would like to participate, and we want people to know what this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| and why we are making certain suggestions for performance measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| I think the more that people in the community understand what we've learned about best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| then the more acceptance there will be for the final performance measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| So this is not, if you're suggesting, Vice Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| that you would like to be involved in that process or anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| then I would think that the Urban League would welcome more people understanding those best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| and understanding the criteria that, you know, we are recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:35| Well, I would like to ultimately, as I heard Councilman Becker, I think, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| ultimately be apprised of what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| I think there are probably people out there in the Urban League network and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| and Felix and Larry and some folk who may understand those a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| So while I'm not suggesting, hey, let me be on that committee, I'd like to be informed and be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| I guess my question is really going more to the establishment and the evaluation of performance measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| Now, Deputy Martin, I heard you say shared with P&I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| Define for me shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| The question I have is if you guys and the Urban League come up with performance measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| and you share them with P&I board, especially, and see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| this is another reason why I circle right back around to the constitution of the P&I board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| because as you guys go and deal with them, if it is not representative of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| and up and ready and fully functional and ready to go, then I see us getting back into the same old where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| But my question is, does shared mean informationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| or does it mean they're going to have an opportunity to check out, veto, change, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| As well as the evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| I think I used the word, and I may have used it in both places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| Previously, both P&I and the city were doing evaluations, but that will no longer be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| The actual evaluations will be done by city personnel, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| We will, and here's where I use shared again, in the role of governance of P&I as defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:10| just as this proposal, this resolution, this contract went to the P&I board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| so will the evaluations be shared with the P&I board as to how that program is functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| Now, what is fundamental to that working well is for the P&I board to be the board all of us, I think, want it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:32| and I think the P&I leadership want it to be, and that's reflecting the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| I think if all of those things are in place, I think this will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| and P&I will fulfill its responsibility as governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| We'll fulfill our responsibility of evaluating those programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| and we will make the recommendations as to whether to continue or to terminate those programs to P&I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| And the establishment of the performance measure, when you share those with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| is that an informational sharing with P&I, or will they, again, be able to say, hey, we don't like those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| We like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Stick this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| I guess my question is, if that is the case and how you all see this model working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| it just further underscores my concern about the governance issue and the makeup of the P&I board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| And that's why I brought this in this form and fashion today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| because as I have stated to you guys and even to the Urban League Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| my paternalistic side is very concerned to make sure that what I'm sitting on first seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| and looking at things that maybe the Urban League Board doesn't see and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| that they're not in over their head and that they're in a win-win if this is where we end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| The city is in a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| And most importantly, the citizens are empowered, putting input, and are in a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| And this just behooves us to move quickly with the P&I board to reconstitute themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2871)|
| 0:48:00| which they have already stated their commitment to doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| so that the hope would be when we bring these performance criteria back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| that there would be the expanded board and whatever changes are going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| Let me also back again to talk very quickly with regards to the loan committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| and back to my point about what I call non-traditional lenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| and mortgages that they be considered, you know, in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| since it's going to ultimately, if it ends up with the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| if that board is going to determine that we're not just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| with all due respect to First Tennessee and MSF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| they'll just not be a First Tennessee person that we think got the box on some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Also, as you have your discussion with the P&I board and reconstituting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| and as Councilman Holquist said, you know, one of the things I started out with was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| hey, what if we go with a different model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| If we went with a different model, while the name might change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| I still think that what I've suggested here with regards to the make-up of that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| and this is back to Councilman Woodhull's question to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| I think the suggested make-up of the board now makes it a much stronger board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| from a community empowerment perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| Right now we have a board of seven people from the ZACs and seven institutional folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| seven-seven, you know, kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| What I'm suggesting is more of a 12 people that are actually from the ZACs, from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| with three institutional folk being the voting block of 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| and then those five supporting folk of city, county, chamber, UT, TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| and five at-large people who would be non-voting but would be there bringing their resources to bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| So as you look at that, you know, I want to make sure that that's clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| and I would suggest that with regards to those empowerment zones positioned too from each of the area ZACs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| that since the ZACs are not constituted right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| that council members in whose district those ZACs lie, understanding that there's some overlapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| You know, something like the Central District, for example, Central ZAC overlaps with Councilman Holquist and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| You know, we could sit down and confer, and if there's two spots, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| we got some suggestions so that council members who talk to people every day, who see them every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| maybe that's where we go to get that resource of how we get this reconstituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| And having said all that, I know you all are tired of hearing from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| I still, you know, I still want to make my motion to postpone for 30 days as a result of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:33| I'm going to do a, with all due respect, I'm going to do a Councilman Becker and put it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| and if it fails for lack of a second, all right, then I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| There's been a motion and a second to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| We'll make it four weeks just for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| And that's with the clear understanding that all these things that still could be going on can still be going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| I don't see us stopping in four weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| You guys coming back to us and going, we're still at the same square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| I don't see that as being a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| You can still do all these things that we're talking about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| So I'll make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Anybody else like to comment in addition to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| The motion is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| I heard Bailey and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3077)|

| 0:51:59| You know, I still think we're doing a half thing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| and I've made it very clear what my position is and all these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| but because I still think we can do this better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| and because I think we're kind of doing half of it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| I won't be able to support doing this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3133)|

| 0:53:53| Excuse me, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| I've been listening to Mr. Brown way too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| You just paid him a great compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Calling me Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Isn't just way too much of a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| He's going to sleep well tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| Well, I just may just destroy my credibility with him with this comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:16| You know, do you all get to have some supervisory opportunities with these folks when they accept these contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| I thought you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Well, I just have a real little thing that's been a sore spot with me for the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| And I have no idea if it's Denny's or whom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| But it's when they mow these medians, they throw the grass into the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| And I've got some particular areas that I have in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| And I really think it's a dangerous thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Sometimes the cuttings get very heavy and that gets thrown in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| And it is very unsightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| But I think it also is a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| And I just thought this would be a good time for someone to give you the opportunity to remind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| that they need to be cognizant of where their cuttings are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| We will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| And we do talk to them about those type of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| Thank you so much, Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| And let the record reflect that was for Mr. Anderson that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Oh, and that was also for Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3317)|

| 0:56:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Real briefly, this is something that's very important to the city both financially as well as the citizens of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:08| It's my understanding secondhand that even my good friends at Knowledgey support this not happening at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| But one of the things that could happen is, and this is real serious, all kidding aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| is that cable providers would be able to cherry pick parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| My concern is that more affluent areas of parts of town would have a smorgasbord of service providers available to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:37| and less fortunate economic areas would have the check cashing pawn shop equivalent of cable service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| And that's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| I mean, you know, we're here to protect not just the first with the most but the last with the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| So I think this is a very serious matter that we should watch carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| And just for counsel, we are actively engaged on this effort in Nashville and in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3478)|

| 0:58:04| Excuse me, Councilman Hulsquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| How are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Yeah, and I agree with what you said and what Councilman Frost has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I think it's really serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| We could also potentially through this or through the FCC ruling, my understanding is we could lose cable access television at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| That's even a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| There are all kinds of things on the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| And I don't know how many people know about the FCC ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| I don't know enough to speak about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| But there are some real concerns out there, and I'm glad that we are working this actively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3511)|

| 0:58:59| Mr. Hulsquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| I just want to say real briefly thank you to your other Councilmembers for supporting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| and, of course, the companion ordinance for 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| And I won't belabor it, but I think everybody has seen and heard about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| But it's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| We've got a lot of sponsoring organizations, and I won't list because the list grows every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| It's longer and longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| But it's going to be a great event, and I think it will really help us as a region think about how we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3564)|

| 0:59:50| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| An ordinance to rezone property from R1 low-density residential district to RP1 planned residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| at a density of up to 5.99 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| Property located on the northwest side of Eddington Road, south of Cherokee Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Metropolitan Planning Commission applicant first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| Move to postpone this for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Mr. King, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| John King here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| As I said before, a motion to postpone for four weeks pretty well does away with the request for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:37| What I'd like to see is a motion to approve my rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| I came here to say that after this was postponed, there was a motion to postpone it four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:48| I resisted that, and at the behest of another member of council, I yielded to a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:59| It was suggested that maybe I use that as an opportunity to talk to Councilman Holquist and perhaps to Rick Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3659)|
| 1:01:09| I have done both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| I'm sorry that I'm the messenger here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| I think you will recall that I was asked whether I thought it would do any good or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| and I said it depended on how reasonable Councilman Holquist was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| I'm sorry I have to be the messenger to report that in a unique and uncharacteristic turn of events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| Councilman Holquist, it's really a rare departure from the norm for him, but he's being unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| And it persists in his position that he will not support rezoning this unless we agree to annex the entirety of the 38 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:47| in exchange for rezoning this less than one-third of an acre of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| I have had occasion to talk to him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| I told him we're not in a position to yield to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| That's a matter that's in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| It's going to get resolved there one way or the other in due course of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| I respectfully ask that you vote against the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:13| If that motion to postpone is defeated, I would hope someone would make a motion to approve my request for rezoning this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:22| to plan a residential up to 5.99 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| I had a discussion about what this was, what the circumstances of it were before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| I'm not going to reiterate them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| It's been a long evening for all of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| I was joking with somebody and said I had a 45-minute tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| I proposed a place showing all the attributes of the property, but I elected not to show it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| And in due respect, Councilman Holquist, I would ask the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| You wouldn't have fit in your five minutes anyway, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| I ask that the other members of the Council vote against the request to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| Councilman Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| I just wanted to ask Councilman Holquist what was the reason to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| Well, the alternative would be to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| And I thought, you know, we should really get – if we make a motion to deny, then they –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| by MPC's rules, they can't come back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| Now, I guess this Council could take, you know, reconsideration as a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| And that would take six votes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| But someone could move to reconsider at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| And that's certainly a possibility if they were denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| But I thought it may be more reasonable to sort of give more opportunity this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| But anyway, I have more to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| I heard the discussion two weeks ago about annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| And, you know, I, for one, would like to base my decision on the zoning issue on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| has he – have they fulfilled their obligation to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| Have they done what's legally required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| And I don't think it's appropriate to base my zoning decision on annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| So, you know, that's just where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| And I'd like to hear any other comments, and I'd like to hear it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| Councilman Hulkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Well, I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| The reality is this is part and parcel of the entire development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| It's all going to be one development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| And I assume probably since – I think it's for apartments, so it would be one lot, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| and probably end up being one parcel to be able to work effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| I don't really know how they're going to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| But I think it's very reasonable for us to say, yeah, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| we think it makes sense to do this under certain circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| And to me, those circumstances would be where it's all part of the same jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| And keeping in mind this council voted to annex that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| and I think Mr. King was representing the buyers at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| I don't know if they had acquired it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| I don't think they've acquired it yet, but I think they have it under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| But although I think technically they sued through Citizens for Home Rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| but I believe Mr. King was representing them at that point and advising them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| And it's easy to advise somebody that it's, you know, you can stay out of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| and it'll work better for you this way or that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| But part of that is obviously in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| And this council has approved compromises and deals all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| We have given money to people in order for them to agree to come into the city and drop lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| We've done a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| And I don't think it's unreasonable to say let's think about rezoning in the context of the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3954)|
| 1:06:02| rather than this one little piece which will be a part of the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| I think that's very awkward for a little piece of it to be in the city, but it's the same development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| I don't think that even makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| You've got this little postage stamp piece of property that has to be inspected by city inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| You know, all the city rules apply, but everything around it city rules don't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| And my understanding is that at this point they're not willing to talk about even coming into the city at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| So I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| To me, it's very problematic if we have a little piece come in and not the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| So I think it only makes sense to say let's do it as a whole in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| or, you know, we won't try to tie what's in the city to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Well, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Mr. Vail, I think this is a really good question about how we judge zoning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| And I think it's important to keep in mind that it's not the Metropolitan Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| It's the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| And this is sort of related to this issue, but it's bigger, that this is about planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| It's about how the city grows and develops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| It's more than just is this property, you know, is the right density for this property the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| It's a much bigger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| And I think this council for years, probably decades, has not done a good job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| We do zonings of individual properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| and we've had the advantage up until recently of being able to fight things out at a concept plan level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| which we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| And, unfortunately, we have to think much more on the front end about these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| because we don't have that option anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| So I think it is fair, and I think it's actually important to consider options or factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| other than just does this property, you know, meet the density requirements that we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| It's a bigger question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| It's about planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| I just wanted to see if Mr. King had something he wanted to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| He's still standing at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| I do in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Maybe my approach earlier was a little bit cavalier, and I shouldn't have been that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| but it's been a long evening for me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| I have a client here who is not unmindful of the public interest as it relates to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:21| Not being, if you will, so involved in the city versus county issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:32| and what they are doing with regard to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| You know, as a matter of interest to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| and the interest this body should exhibit as stewards for that public interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| my client and one other developer out there, if my client goes forward in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| are putting in about a million and a half dollars to put in a new water system for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| That's new water lines, a pumping station, a water tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| It will solve, if you will, a chronic and existing problem on Cherokee Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| that has been there for the entirety of its existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| It will give them water pressure and water volume and water capacity that they have not had to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| At the same time, it will serve our respective developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| but also provide increased and better water service with better pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| and capability for developments otherwise than these throughout that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| which is in, a major portion of which is in Councilman Hulquist's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| The predecessor in title, Hines, had utilized this property in a fashion suitable for its purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:56| and had done some digging, which resulted in some slippage of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| that belongs to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| We are curing that issue, although not legally obligated to ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| nor are we legally obligated to do what they want it done, i.e., put it back like it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| We've agreed we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| I think that operates to the advantage of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| It's not like we went in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| we're not willing to do some things that need to be done for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| We're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| All we ask is that that one-third of an acre, which, by the way, is being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| if it hasn't already become, is being made part of one parcel of the entire parcel of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| I heard with interest Councilman Hulquist's idea about split zoning on a single piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:50| Well, if you leave this one like it is, you're going to have split zoning on a single piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| and it's going to be a little bitty piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Once again, I think the fairness dictates in this instance that this property ought to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Is there any idea when this matter is set for trial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| I do not represent the client in that particular litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| I know that Ms. Poplin has been talking with lawyers involved about getting some of the cases set for trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:23| This one would be one of the more recent ones filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| So, you know, Councilman, I'd say you're talking two years, three or more probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| I mean, I always try to support the district-specific representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| but I don't remember what Mr. Donaldson said from MPC staff last go-around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:49| And I'm hoping this gets resolved soon, sooner versus later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| because my concern is we have a minor portion of property that is being hamstringing a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4314)|
| 1:12:06| My preference would be that that development was in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| but the fact of the matter is the bulk of it is presently outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| I suspect that there's a speedy resolution one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| so I'm just kind of waving a yellow flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| Councilman Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Well, I would just respond to say that I think we may be able to see if there's a way to speedily resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:33| Obviously, if it just goes on for two or three years waiting to be scheduled and going to trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| it's not going to be speedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| We may have an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| We may not, but we won't know if we don't try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Just real quickly, to refresh my memory, the size of the development, is it 30 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:55| The remaining property, you're looking at it over there to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| I think it's about 38 acres in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| I could look at my own document here, but I figured you could tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| You could tell me 38 acres and the part that's in the city is what, less than 1% of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| The part that's in the city is .34 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| .34, which is less than 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| The motion is currently on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| I just wanted to ask, Mr. King, what's your choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| Should we postpone this or do you want us to vote it up and down, deny it or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| I do not want to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| In fact, the motion before us is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| All those in favor of postponement, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| I heard Holquist and Becker and Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| Holquist, Becker, and Frost in favor of postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| Did I miss anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| I heard everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| So, three to six, the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| I'm going to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| The motion on the floor now is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| Why don't you just call the roll real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Joe, is that a lie or an old lie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| I thought that was an old one, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4466)|

| 1:14:43| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| Three to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| That's all we have now is a negative motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| I'd like to make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4496)|

| 1:17:24| Now I'm from Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Mr. Mayor, you did a pretty good job tonight, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| What happened to Joe Baby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Dude done started talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| It's time to get re-elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| He opened his mouth, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| He said, I've been quiet for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| Shoot, he must be on speed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| But anyway, this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| Mr. Anderson, you know we never give you your props, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| You done helped a lot of people get jobs, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| I ain't gonna thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| But Mr. Mayor, for you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| I know you all, I listened to you on the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| You all into this big waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| As a matter of fact, good interview two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| But you into this waterfront the next 10, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| You said how great it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| And you're going to have to have another legacy, man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| because every part of Knoxville is going to be growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| but East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| I heard one of your council members sit up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| by the night and was talking about one of the agendas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| you all were just recently talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| was that property with the lawyer, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| You go up down Matanoia, man, there's nothing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| but pine shops, nail places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| All this is a bunch of junk up down Matanoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| But you go to other parts of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| everybody's building up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| All of Knoxville's building up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| And I hold this body not fully responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| but somewhat responsible, because all the white council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| men and council women, they making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| that their districts are getting well built up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| and well taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| To me, I could use another bad word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| to say that they really don't give a good flying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| hoop about East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| I mean, I'm seeing the rest of Knoxville shooting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| Purebred, everything else, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| I was out in Fountain City one day, Councilor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| nothing was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Next day, I went back to Fountain City, man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| she found the city looked like Kingston Pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| And you're telling me that Knoxville is growing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| I believe the minorities and whites, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| we're all minorities in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| because there is no growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| And you all are the one that's stunting this growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And man, I wanted to be real negative tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| but I don't think I'm going to be negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| Because I came to shoot down a councilman tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| but it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| But I'm going to get him the next time I come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| Councilman Woodall, you're on my hit list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| And brother, me and you, hey, brother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| don't I got a double barrel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| And when I bring it out, constituents in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| and other parts of Knoxville, they're going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| you know Montgomery got a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| All my years in the military, if I see one of my soldiers down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| Mr. Brown, on the battlefield, I'm going to pick him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| Mr. Woodall, he wasn't no brother that would leave you down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| and let you die, long as he get out squeaky clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| But we're going to take that subject another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| But it's late, Mr. Mayor, but I hope you consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| looking at East Knoxville again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Beth Olsen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Patty, you want to go next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| I can't see, Becca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| If you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Patty Barrier, 807 Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I just wanted to give you something up here and then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4852)|
| 1:21:00| Here, if you'll hand them out, I'll get them around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4862)|
| 1:21:11| What that is, it's just some of the names of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| that are supporting a change in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| That's one of my main issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| I support the waterfront plan overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| I do not want to see all these years wasted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| that we've spent putting this plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Our neighborhood originally, back in 1999,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| actually went through three years of a T&T program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| something very similar to what we're doing here with the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| The Phillips Avenue right-of-way needs to be reconsidered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| in the south waterfront plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| This is an old neighborhood street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| It is not a new subdivision street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| Phillips has houses that are nearly 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| I mean, our house is over 70-something years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| The right-of-way total is 50 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| and that includes pavement, sidewalk, and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| There will be streets that can handle increased traffic volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| These are Sevier Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| and hopefully the new riverfront road that will eventually be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| Phillips Avenue is not a through street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| but this plan makes it a through street with the wider right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| which is in opposition to traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| which should really narrow streets down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| so that people can't just speed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| There would also be a loss of trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| and that's a major concern with actually quite a few people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| both fronting on Phillips and behind on Langford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| but Phillips is the main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| And anyways, there would be a loss of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| The setbacks also would not be able to be met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| and that's really going to become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| If the right-of-ways are taken eventually over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| you're looking at losses on not just maybe a front side of a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| but maybe the side of a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| the back of the house if the alleys are expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| and on residential lots, that's quite a bit of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| that is actually being taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:53| Phillips Avenue needs to retain its pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| of being closed off to Davenport Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| I'm not exactly for Phillips going through to what would be Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:08| However, I understand there are pros and cons to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| but either way, my main concern here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| is on the right-of-way for Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| It would be nice to be able to see it decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| We don't need sidewalks on two sides of Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| We don't need a five-foot sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| We're talking about an old residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| Anyways, I plan on bringing this up also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| at the Oversight Committee tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Dave had asked people to e-mail him by the 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| and I have not yet sent mine to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| which I plan on doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Anyways, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Martha?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| Also, you'll see in the petition, we've got Martha Olson, 601 Augusta Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| The petition is also some people from our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Even though it doesn't specify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| we're also concerned about right-of-way widenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| and people losing their front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| So that's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| It's not just an issue with Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| It's an issue on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| We want the existing homeowners and property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| to be respected in this planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| I'd like to see this go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| I think, as Patty mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| we've got a planning committee meeting tomorrow at 530 next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| There's going to be a lot of big issues to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| but there's a couple of small issues that seem to have fallen through the cracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| that I'd like to bring to your attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| and I've handed you some handouts here from the zoning plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| One of the things that is kind of personal to me is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| it seems we've been around and around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| It used to say no large-scale agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| I said, well, what's large-scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| You know, they said an acre, and I said, well, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Write it in there, and now I'm seeing major agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| and it's got all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| According to my lawyer, it could be construed to say even gardens are illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| and that's sort of something I want to make real clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| that, you know, we've had gardens, that we can have gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| We can continue to have gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| You know, I had a little fruit stand up at Market Square with my extra tomatoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| I grew it in my garden on Blount Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| and at the same time, you know, this had come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| I got a petition with about 40 signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| people saying we need to allow gardens in the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| I've got a property on Blount Avenue I plan to develop in 5 or 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| In the meantime, I'm growing stuff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| I'd like to, perhaps if I had the time, develop it as a community garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| I see community gardens as one of the things that were mentioned as a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| in the workshops, public workshops at the Curbella Temple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| So I would just like to be able to have that, and it be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| So if that's something that we could adjust before tomorrow day somehow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| or talk to the legal director so that I can rest easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| knowing that myself and my neighbors can have our little garden patches legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| because in all the residential zones, even in R1, even in Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| if you read the zoning map, it says that row crops are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| You know, I'm not talking about pigs and chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| I'm talking about row crops, and so I just want to know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| Another little issue that's shown up in the zoning is the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:44| and talks about getting the building permits and that sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| from the South Waterfront Administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| and I'm happy to see that you don't have to go through that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| if you're building a house or a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| I understand for bigger development you do, and that's to be expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| but I have a concern that anybody, any of my neighbors that want to get a remodeling permit, alter, remodel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:11| maybe put on gutters or a storm door or something, and they go down to get a building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| and according to this, it has to go in front of the South Waterfront Administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| and, you know, I know Dave's going to be a busy man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| and I don't know if he needs to be approving everybody's, you know, minor building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| so that's just a little pet peeve that I'd like to see addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| and then, of course, we'll be talking a lot about, you know, much bigger issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| having to do with building heights and roads and things like that tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| but just these have sort of fallen through the cracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| and I wanted to call them to your attention because they are something that's, you know, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| I think if you're trying to micromanage the lives and tell us where we can grow tomatoes and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| that's just not a good sign, and, you know, I think we're trying to be, well, generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5334)|
| 1:29:06| We're having a lot of change being forced on us, whether we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| Some like it, some don't, and, you know, we'd like to be able to retain a bit of our old lifestyle if we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Yeah, I'd like to ask Mr. Hill, will gardens be allowed in the South North for waterfront redevelopment plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:28| I think we'd like to have gardens in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| I mean, like for crops, not necessarily flowers or stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| I prefer the farm machinery to stay out in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| And what about, she did mention a point about the, well, I guess that you have to give approval to any alterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:47| or anything that's done to a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| I really don't think that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| The idea is if you're exempting a single family or a duplex from these processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| why would you expect a remodeling of a single family house to go in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| So we'll go back and double check it, but that's certainly not the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Sorry, we've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Bess Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:20| Bess, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Bess Newton, 511 Mimosa Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Thanks for sticking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| I quickly wanted to say that I have a petition in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| and it's an update from a letter that, or a few letters that Dave Hill gave to you before your prior meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5433)|
| 1:30:40| regarding my neighborhood, which is Mimosa, surrounded by Ashley and Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| We are currently zoned for SW3, which is a severe avenue zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| and we are not severe avenue, which is deemed to be sort of a main street vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| I am excited about a lot of the plans, and I look forward to working with you on them in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| But my neighbors and I are very concerned about the zoning that we've been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| and I have a petition with 26 of those residents that have signed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| a total of 46, which include other neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| So that is on those three streets, and I would like to redo that petition briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| and then leave it with you for further examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| The Ashley Jones Mimosa neighborhood is a quiet residential area of modest scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| The South Knoxville Waterfront Plan currently seeks to zone this area as SW3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| SW3 is not in keeping with this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| While SW2 is marginally better, it is still inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| Both SW3 and SW2 would adversely affect these four blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| SW1 is the only zoning designation that would preserve the character of this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| We therefore request these four blocks be designated SW1 in the Knoxville South Waterfront Development Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| and this will also be given to Dave Hill for tomorrow's oversight committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| And I hope that my neighbors and my residents have been calling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| and leaving nice messages or talking to you about this, as it is of great concern to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| And I'm glad that gardens will still be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| We stand to adjourn, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| I'd just like to ask Ms. Mitch to make a copy of what I gave out, a part of the record in the council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| Having no further business, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070130d2?start=5552)|
