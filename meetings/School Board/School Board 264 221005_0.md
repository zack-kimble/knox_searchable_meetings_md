| 0:00:31| Welcome to the Board of Education's October 5th, 2022 regular session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=31)|
| 0:00:39| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=44)|
| 0:00:55| Please face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=55)|
| 0:00:58| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=58)|
| 0:01:12| Please be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=72)|
| 0:01:20| As Superintendent Reiswick announced on Monday evening, the Knox County Schools fall break is next week, October 10th through the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=80)|
| 0:01:29| And on behalf of the board, I wish all of our students, families, staff and community a well-deserved break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| Also, today is World Teachers Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| So I just wanted to express our appreciation to all of our amazing Knox County Schools educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=98)|
| 0:01:45| And changes to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| Board members, you received an updated version of the superintendent's evaluation instrument yesterday, making the small change we discussed at our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=107)|
| 0:01:55| So hopefully you have had time to review that final document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| Also, Terry emailed my final board committee enroll appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| And that listing has been attached to the agenda for your reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| You also received an updated attachment for item 6D1 via email, which reflected a small legal change to the KUB utility easement we are considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=127)|
| 0:02:18| And I just wanted to know again for the record that item 6D2 has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| Are there any requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| So a motion by Ms. Horne to approve, a second by Ms. Henderson. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| Ms. Coatney. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| Item 5, approve appointment of Board of Education committees and roles for 2022-2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=165)|
| 0:02:55| Motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Horne. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| All in favor say aye. I'm sorry. Sorry, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| Thank you. I did have a question only because of the addition of a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| So there is an addition of the 865 committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| Dr. Roswood, do you want to say anything to that because that is a new committee for the board to be a part of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Yes, there was, and Dr. Wilson may want to add to this, but working through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| there's a steering committee for that process and it just kind of drives the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| And so there was kind of a request that we have a board presence since it's an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| and a future kind of decision of where that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| So I believe that's why that was added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| so that there could be a board presence in that as we meet with other community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| to make sure we're steering in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| All right. So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=235)|

| 0:08:01| Motion by Ms. Horn, a second by Mr. McMillan. And I believe we have a public forum speaker on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| Ms. Paula Hancock, if you don't mind stating your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=489)|
| 0:08:17| Thank you. Paula Hancock, Knox County is my residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| And I am here to express to you all a gratitude and appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| The external backdrop, inflation and cost of living increases for our educators and educational support professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| coming into this school year has been challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Many offer support, but few put their words into action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| So I would like to take this opportunity to thank Superintendent Dr. Roswick for recommending approval by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| to reflect the employer covering the entire increase of the employee health insurance premium rate for 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| I would also like to thank the Knox County Board of Education for their consent and the PECA teams for their collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| Thank you again. We greatly appreciate your commitment. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you, Ms. Hancock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| That concludes public forum for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| So we have a motion by Ms. Horn and a second by Mr. McMillan. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Hancock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| I also wanted to just give my thanks to Dr. Roswick and the administration for making the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| I think it's important that we take care of our educators and our employees in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| Item 10D, approve school zone for new Northwest Sector Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=591)|
| 0:10:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| So a motion by Ms. Henderson, a second by Mr. Watson. I believe we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| Yes, we have public forum speakers for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| First is Patty Saha. Patty Saha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=612)|
| 0:10:20| Next we have Anthony Peters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| If you don't mind stating your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| My name is Anthony Peters. I live in Knox County in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| I live off of Mill Creek, which is back close to the Mountain Hill Lake, which is sort of the further realm of the new proposed rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=634)|
| 0:10:45| And I wanted to take the opportunity to speak to you all this evening before the vote to reiterate the concerns we've already talked to some of you all at the last two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=645)|
| 0:10:54| My main motive is to try to have the rezoning of the new elementary school exclude those of us that live in closer proximity and travel on safer roads to get to Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=654)|
| 0:11:05| than we would be using to get to the new school, which would include all of us that are out off of Gwin and a lot of the folks off Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=665)|
| 0:11:14| Currently, the bus and my wife travel via Swafford to get to the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| Swafford becomes Steel, and then it's right there next to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| So it's pretty direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| No lights, no traffic clog ups or any of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| If we're rezoned to the new elementary school, the quickest route would be to travel via Pellissippi Parkway and cross, I guess, northbound traffic to get to the center and merge into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=687)|
| 0:11:37| and then cross over to get on the Coward Mill to get to the school, which, as you guys know, isn't safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| Or you'd be sending buses down that way, which you all told us that you're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| So at the proposed zone meeting at Carnes last month, we spoke with Terry Mill or Hill, I think is the county commissioner for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=709)|
| 0:11:58| And she said that the county plans on closing those byroads, including George Light and Coward Mill, which would make the commute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=718)|
| 0:12:07| You've got either the option of taking the unsafe way, which is a lot quicker and more direct, or going down Solway, which is a lot longer and a lot more traffic that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=727)|
| 0:12:17| So everybody that lives off the Solway Road in this new rezoning is pulling from sort of the heart of Hardin Valley down here by Mountain Hill Lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| would be traveling on the same route down Solway, left on Hardin Valley, left on Cherahalla, and then back there onto Coward Mill, which is not ideal, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=744)|
| 0:12:35| The two prior meetings left us feeling unheard. We were told that the road conditions, travel concerns, traffic and all that stuff sort of was not exactly y'all's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=755)|
| 0:12:44| I almost felt like it hadn't been taken into consideration, as some of y'all stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| You don't even know what the proposed travel time would be to get from some of these neighborhoods to the new school at that time of morning or in the afternoon when traffic's real bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=769)|
| 0:13:00| So we're real grateful for this new school. The location of it is kind of wacky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| But right now my son's in a double classroom with 42 students, so obviously we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| But I just hope that y'all would reconsider where the zones lie right now and what part of Hardin Valley y'all are pulling from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Next we have Christine Peters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Christine Peters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| That was my wife. It's Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| Next we have Lawrence Allen speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Good afternoon. How are you today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Hello. Good. How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Just state your name and county of residence and you have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| All right. Thank you. My name is Lawrence Allen. I'm in Knox County. I live in Hardin Valley, the Hayden Hill subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| First off, I'd just like to thank y'all for hearing from me today and taking our feelings into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| First off, I just want to mention that this new school is twice the distance from Hayden Hill subdivision as Hardin Valley Elementary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=839)|
| 0:14:09| It makes absolutely no sense to take the Hayden Hill subdivision and move them to this new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| You've got twice the distance. Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| You've got to cross over Pellissippi, not to mention the horrible traffic that's going to be going both ways now on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=858)|
| 0:14:30| Another thing that I keep hearing that between Hayden Hill and Hayden Farms, we're not a part of Hayden Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| Hayden Farms is across the street. That's a different subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| Hayden Hill is 90 percent complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| I think we've got about 25 students at Hardin Valley Elementary School in Hayden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| I just don't understand where 25 students is going to make or break anybody anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| But I tell you what it is going to do. It's going to lower our property values for all of us that just bought homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| Many of us bought homes there specifically to be in Hardin Valley Elementary District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| We did it just to be there for our kids, because it's a great school. We'd like to remain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| Our children just started this school. I've got a kindergartner myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| He had a hard time adjusting to a new school, going to kindergarten and starting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| He had a hard time. I know other parents that I've talked to and my neighbors have had the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| These kids are trying to adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| They've started to. They love their teachers. They love their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| They love being an Eagle. They've got songs about it. They love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| Now you're telling us we've got to go do it again all next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| I keep hearing from the people that plan this that it's all about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Our children are not numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| The people that live in Hayden Hill and Hardin Valley are not numbers. We're people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| They're going to make friends at this new school that they're going to have to leave in a few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| when they go back to Hardin Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| It's not fair to the children. It's not fair to the families and the people who bought homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| It's just not fair. I implore you all to reject this zoning plan and send them back to come up with a better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=976)|
| 0:16:25| It makes no sense for us to be that close to the school and have to go twice as far to get to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| It boggles my mind. I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| We've sent things to legislators. We've sent things to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| We've gotten mostly no response, except for Ms. Henderson and maybe one or two others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| But I ask you all to reject this plan. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Next up, Jonathan, and I apologize if I butcher your name, McShan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| You got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| To state your name and county residence, you have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Jonathan McShan, Knox County, Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| What he said is basically why I'm up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| I have twin daughters that are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| They go to Little Hawks Daycare, and they have an after-school program that picks up from Hardin Valley Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| My wife and I both work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| We were planning to take that advantage of having that after-school program for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| That is no longer going to be the case because they don't pick up at the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| This rezoning has already caused a future financial hardship for us because we have to find after-school care now that's not close to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1051)|
| 0:17:42| When we bought our house, we moved in March 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| We were zoned for Hardin Valley Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| That was the whole sole purpose of us buying where we did, was the daycare, elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Everything was right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| The girls would grow up all the way through the Hardin Valley system, and we'd be part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| Now we're the only subdivision besides Hayden Farm that's not even barely broke ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| We're sitting there in the zone on the backside where we weren't before a week ago or two weeks ago whenever the decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1089)|
| 0:18:19| It makes no sense that we're the only subdivision on Samley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| We have to go to Samley, Downsall Way, through Pellissippi College traffic, take a left on Hardin Valley, go underneath Pellissippi, and back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1103)|
| 0:18:33| Not to mention, I don't know what families are going to do that have kids in elementary and middle school, how they're going to do all that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| There's a doctor in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| She works in the North City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| She was at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| She was begging and pleading that y'all do not do this, because it's going to add almost an hour of her drive time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| because she has to go all the way over to the elementary school, then back to the other side of Hardin Valley to the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| and then try to hit the interstate to get to Lenoir City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| I don't know if all this was thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| I don't know if any of y'all live in Hardin Valley to actually experience the traffic and actually sit there and go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| I know that there has been a request for people to guide the traffic during the school morning, and it's been rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1154)|
| 0:19:23| That would help with the traffic there, if that's part of the issue for moving things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| But the whole purpose of that neighborhood and Hayden Hill, everybody bought there because of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| and you're just yanking and pulling us all out to have future elementary kids and families that are already in that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| It just doesn't make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| The other thing is the bus route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| I asked about that, couldn't get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Well, right now, the buses are on the right side of the road where the entrances are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| The kids just jump right on the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| If they're coming from the other direction, they have to cross over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| So they have to cross the lane of traffic in the dark in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| People fly down Sam Lee and Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| It's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| That concludes public forum for this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| So we have a motion by Ms. Henderson and a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| I appreciate you all coming and sharing some of your concerns and frustrations tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| I do think a good question is being asked, and I don't know that we heard it in the presentation, and I don't think I saw it in the memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| I'm curious, Dr. Adams, has there been any kind of study that looks at drive times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| And the reason I'm asking this is not that you all need to know this, but I live kind of near Fellowship Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| Living there, I'm zoned for Carnes, elementary, middle, and high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| So like I know, when my kids were little, it took me 20 minutes to get them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| And I know that's a consideration for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| I'm asking if it's a consideration in the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| And has there been any kind of study to try to understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| I mean, Hardin Valley does have some wonky traffic patterns given Pellissippi cutting right through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| and not all the through streets being able to get through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Specific studies for drive times, no, not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| I will say proximity-wise, when you look at the proximity between the new school and Hardin Valley Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| the time-wise is exactly the same as far as very, very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| Can you say more about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| I'm not sure I understand what you mean when you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Yeah, so Ryan, would you step up for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| We looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| He's got it down to a science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| He can look at a map and tell you where people live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| But he's got it down to the exact time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| So we did take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| I can also tell you I drove during those peak hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| I used to live close to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| So I'm familiar with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| So we took some of the back roads, some of the main roads in different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Dr. Schaefnacher did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| But when we looked at it, we looked at exactly where the distance was for Hayden Hills in particular to the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| Well, I think it's – and, Ryan, I do want you to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| I do think it's important, too, to note that whenever you create a new zone, drive times will be longer for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| You can't create a new zone and not make drive times longer for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| So I just want that to be stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| But I am curious what you all learned as you kind of looked at it from the traffic pattern standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| So, obviously, we run buses there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| So we kind of live the traffic in Hardin Valley to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| But it was a – I mean, I'm not going to lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| I didn't look at every single piece of property that is being rezoned and recalculate drive times for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| But we did look at some of the larger population centers and what it might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Obviously, time of day matters a lot as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| So we looked at particular at the times that school is going to be running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| And so they're – everyone that has spoken here tonight about the drive time increasing for Hayden Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| in particular to the new school versus the old school, they're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| It is. It's 2.1 miles from the first entrance on Hayden Hill on Stanley Road to Hardin Valley Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| It is 3.2 miles from that same location to the new elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| It is further. It is going to take longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Yeah, but – and when you say 3.2, you mean by actually driving, not the way the road flies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| Correct, on the roads. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Did you say by the way the road flies or are you going down soft way to Hardin Valley Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| On the roads, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| So from the road, it's basically a mile longer in terms of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| And Hayden Hills is a – there's a lot –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| So entrances and exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| And it goes back a ways, so obviously depending on where you start in there, your mileage will vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| So you're talking from the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Correct. There are two entrances, one that is further down Stanley Road closer to Hardin Valley Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| We looked at the one – and we have bus stops at both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| We looked at the one specifically closer to Solway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| I also have a question for Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| With you being in this area, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| You probably have heard more about it than most, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| So I'm just curious what your thoughts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Yeah, so I was actually going to speak to that actually after you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| You know, while I'm very grateful for the staff that put in a lot of time on these maps and included me through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| I'm very grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| And rezoning is not an easy thing to do, and I know it doesn't make everyone happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| I know we're going to have a great school with a great leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| Dr. Schaefknocker was my own children's principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| She knows the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| She's going to be a great leader for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| With that said, you know, I have heard from many families, and I share their concerns as a parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| and I would like to see the current families at Hardin Valley that we've heard from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| those current families have a choice and a family choice of where they would like to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| And I understand the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| But I would like to see them have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| I was rezoned in fourth grade because of overcrowding, so I lived it as a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| I understand it as a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| So for those reasons, I'm going to have to vote no on the zoning plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| Does that answer your question a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| Well, I was going to ask a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| So when you said families who are currently at Hardin Valley Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| do you mean all families that would be affected by the zone change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| or are you speaking to specific neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| The ones that are affected by the zone change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| I do think that a lot of families will choose the new school because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| there's a lot of families that are excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| But the ones we have heard from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| I would like to have a choice from anyone that's affected with the zoning to have that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I'm sure you've mentioned that to Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Dr. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I know we've gone back and forth through different scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| So just so you know, there are 36 homes that have been sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| and those families have not moved into those homes as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| So when we say current families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| are we talking about the 46 students that are currently there at the elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| or are we talking about the 36 students with the additional families who are moving in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| I mean, I would like to see the ones that are currently there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| anyone who moves in afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| But the ones that are currently there, I would like to see, just have that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| Just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| And I know you've gone over the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| I completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| I was just wondering, because those families technically, it's their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| It's their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| They purchased the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| So technically, they're residents of Hayden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| You're saying they made a choice in purchasing that home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| assuming they probably would have went to that elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Well, they're residents of Hayden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| So I'm assuming they would be included in your proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| Like families who have not actually moved in yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| But they've purchased the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Dr. Eisen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Do you mind if I jump in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| I want to make sure of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| It sounds like what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| if you are currently enrolled in Hardin Valley Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| you're saying that you would like for those families to have a choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| to stay at Hardin Valley as opposed to go to the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| So the way I'm hearing that is that would be kindergarten through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| current kindergarten through fourth grade students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| And I would like to see anybody, because I have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| we've heard a lot from Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| I have heard from a couple Carnes families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| I don't want to exclude anybody because it's affecting three schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| So anybody who purchased a home, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| they purchased a home in that zone and have created this culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| and created this love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| They specifically bought in that community to go to these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| So anyone who's affected, I would like to see them have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| So just so I can be, make sure I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| This may be where you were asking Dr. Adams, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| So we're saying not, I think what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| I'm trying to put words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Make sure we understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| So you're saying, so if that would be current students, K through four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| in any of the three schools that potentially would have the choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| I think the question that I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| what I think I heard you asking Dr. Adams was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| say someone has a three-year-old that's not in school yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| are we saying they would be included because they're in the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| or are we saying just currently enrolled students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| I just want to make sure we're clear on when we calculate that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Is that what you were asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| That's correct, Dr. Reiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| And just to clarify, we're not just talking about Hayden Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Anybody who would want to stay in their current school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| Which, you know, may not be feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| but that's where I'm coming from as a representative to these people's voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| And I want to lift up their voices and what I've heard from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| Mr. Watson, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Ms. Henderson, I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| I'm sorry, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| I'm getting distracted because if we have to have conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| if you could leave the room because people in the audience are kind of distracting you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| Yeah, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| I normally get squirreled, too, and I didn't feel it that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| You know, I'm a little sleepy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| So what was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Okay, so the question is, well, I think if we did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| and we opened it up to everybody for choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| I think we would kind of be working against ourselves in terms of creating a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Because not that it would, but let's say everybody chose to stay at their own school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| we would have an empty school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| So I don't know that we could do that, but Dr. Adams, I am curious if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| So I tried to click the link to the proposal and it's broken on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| I can't get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| I don't know if we can put it up on the screen, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| I'd like for you to speak maybe to the numbers again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| because the other night on Monday you did some calculations around the grandfathering specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| If you can maybe speak to a little bit in terms of what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| I know you haven't calculated the way Ms. Henderson is suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| But if you can run through the numbers again, that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| So what we looked at is we looked at the fourth grade Hardin Valley Elementary School students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| This was in our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| We proposed that they are grandfathered in, and we're talking about 71 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| We looked at Carnes Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| We were looking at students in current grades K-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| This is the grandfathering of the siblings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| K-3, grandfathering in for siblings, for any student who had a sibling in middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1824)|
| 0:30:33| We looked at every one of those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| and it was a total of 70 students for Hardin Valley Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| When we looked at grandfathering in students who had a middle school sibling for Carnes Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| we looked at 25 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| And ball camp, it was a total of four students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| The breakdown of every student for every grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1850)|
| 0:31:05| I'm going to have to pull that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| Yeah, I think the server is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| It should be on the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| That's helpful to a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| Sorry, I'm trying to figure out what my follow-up question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| If you find that number, that's what you're looking for to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| Madam Chair, can I add to that if you don't care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| I think Dr. Adams is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| In the initial proposal, those numbers you see there for the 71 from Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| and the 24 from Carnes and the five from ball camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| those were the number of current fourth-graders who would be rising fifth-graders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| who would be affected by the zone that our proposal was let that terminal grade stay if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| So out of that number, we would not suspect they all wanted to, but we have to plan as if they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| If you looked at the other grades, then you'd be looking at three through five currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| and that would just be the full enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| Potentially they could all stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| If that's the case, you'd be back to those numbers of 1407, 595, and 1208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| Whether they all will or not at that point, we'd have to plan as if they would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| knowing that anyone could, and we'd probably have a window to see who would and wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| Just grandfathering those fifth-graders, if you look at that fourth column over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| just doing that would mean we would open the new school with a capacity of 1,200 at 635.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| So anyone who would choose to stay beyond that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Again, that's fine. I'm just going to make sure we all know what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Potentially it could be 500, 400, some of the new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| So the one element of all this that we haven't brought up in this discussion on Monday or tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| it's similar to what your idea is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| It's just more of a proactive, limited step is the transfer window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| So obviously the transfer window, the way I think it works is it's more of a—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| not everybody gets the transfer just because you request it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| It's more limited than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| So has there been thought of what will happen with the transfer window in relationship to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| I think I've heard in the past that at times when we built new schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| the transfer window has been closed for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| I don't know if that's being suggested here or not, but I don't think we've heard about that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| So they would fall in the same category, and I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| We did not pull the numbers because we looked at grandfathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| and we didn't pull the numbers of every student having the option to stay at their current school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| But it would be the equivalency of any student in the transfer portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| So once that window opens, they can put in the transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| We look at it on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| But this was a question that came up with the community listening sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| and what we explain to parents is, yes, we look at everything on a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| but we also consider can their educational needs be met at their zone school as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| So what if we—because I know we've talked specifically about Hayden Hills and that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| Can you pull the map—can we pull the map back up just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| So Hayden Hills is right here in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| So it's kind of on the edge of the map, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| So what if we did give them a choice, because they are kind of on the edge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| I understand some neighborhoods are in the middle, and the zone makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| But if we gave those folks the choice, how many kids would we be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| Would that be a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| So you're looking at 46 students currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| but the unknown is the 36 homes that are purchased currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| So I can give you the exact number now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| but the projected number within a couple months may change drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| And we did get the number for the Knoxville-Knox planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| and basically in the Hayden Hills community there's 291 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| 80 are attached townhomes, and so 111 are detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| Yeah, yeah. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| And we did not confuse Hayden Hills with Hayden Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| I know that came up because a lot of families had that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| but homes are not even built in Hayden Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| No, no, no, they're not. Yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Is this decision time-sensitive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| Thank you, Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| So we are in the next stage of the process where, as we laid out kind of on Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| where we need to name a school and have a mascot for the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| and start building those kinds of things out, as Dr. Shake-Knocker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| So this would be the time frame to get that done now, moving into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| because we'll start talking about zones affected and staffing once we come back in the next semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| and it always shifts some of the staffing from the current schools to where they'll be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| So to answer your question, I'm doing a long answer to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| but those are all the things that need to be done in that time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| and not having that would make that a lot tighter timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Thank you, Dr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| My thinking is that we're doing a lot of projecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| but we could get the contact info for those folks who have purchased homes to find out about their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2196)|
| 0:36:44| and we could also poll the families who live in that zone to find out what they might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| I know it wouldn't be binding in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| but we could have much more realistic numbers if we polled families to see what their choice would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2213)|
| 0:37:03| if they were given that grandfather option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| So I would like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| I guess it's a substitute motion to delay this for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2229)|
| 0:37:19| So we have a substitute motion to delay for one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2239)|
| 0:37:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| And a second by Ms. Weick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| So any discussion on delaying for a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Should we kind of figure out what we would do during that month that would prepare us to make a decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| You know, if we do want to poll parents and figure out what their decision is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| kind of add that to the motion, say this motion is delayed a month pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| I don't know if we can do that, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| saying this is what we're going to accomplish in the next month that will help us be more educated to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| I like your idea of polling parents just to get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| some feedback on how many would choose the new school versus staying around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| And I'll just say that my concern is in doing this with all the growth is that if we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| and then guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| You know, Hardin Valley Elementary is still overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| And, you know, then, I mean, but that would be my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2306)|
| 0:38:39| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I, well, I'm just sensitive to all the rezoning issues that parents have because it's just so difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| And I've seen all the emails that we've gotten, particularly from Hayden Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| And, I mean, I think if we I think we have enough information right now from Hayden Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| from the emails we've gotten to know kind of what the numbers would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| because I feel like we've probably gotten at least 35 emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| So I think we probably have a lot of that information as far as just people weighing in from that particular neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| I would agree with with Mr. Watson that we we really need to have a firm sound that that's trying to open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| Open up a transfer window would just be too difficult at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| I am sensitive to this particular neighborhood simply because of where it is, where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| So let me let me just make sure that I'm clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| My assumption would be if we just so that parents would understand what we're talking about, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| If we zoned that school, if we left the current zone for Hardin Valley Elementary for that particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| I'm sorry. If we rezone the school to the new school, but allowed families to grandfather in at Hardin Valley Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| they would not have bus service. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you, Ms. Horn. I think at this point, all of those things would be typically in a transfer like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2401)|
| 0:40:09| No, we would not provide bus services. But I think Mr. Watson mentioned earlier kind of on the transfer window and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| We have processes in place on counters that do those. However, in this situation, we could do special anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| Right. So at this point, I think, you know, there's there's things that may not fit totally in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| So I think it's kind of to the board where you guys would want us to do. I appreciate what you said to Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| I think as long as as the staff's clear with what you all want us to bring back for next month, we're happy to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| If it's, you know, just ask the 46 Hayden Hill families that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| If it is everybody, what their willingness would be if they had the opportunity to grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| Now, we just need to make sure we're clear from you all that we bring back what you need to make that decision next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2447)|
| 0:40:56| Ms. Ellen. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Normally, we allow any students to grandfather, don't we? Or am I misremembering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2460)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you, Ms. Ellen. It's been different as we went back through the history and looked in our in our most recent schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| Harden, excuse me. Yeah. Harden Valley and Gibbs Middle. Those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| Those were both terminal grade, like the last grade that we allowed to do that and we didn't the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| And at that point, our recollection and looking through that was because trying to relieve the crowding and having to set some kind of parameter on what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2487)|
| 0:41:36| So that's what we did is mimic what we did on the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| Harden Valley and Gibbs Middle both open at the same time. And we tried to follow that our most recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| So but that it's been done different at different times, is my understanding, throughout schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| So you say fifth graders grandfathered, but others did not. Is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| That was my. Well, it would have been seventh graders, rising eighth graders, maybe the opportunity to say the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| But it was that last grade. So that's what we try to mimic with this to keep the the rising fifth graders in Harden Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| Thank you. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| So, Dr. Adams, please understand that my comment is not faulting anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| I think the difficulty in this conversation for the board is we're not presented with any choice, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| What we're presented is here's a proposal that works. We know it works like from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| And then we have to up it or down it. And what I'm curious about is what other proposals did you all consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| I'm sure this is not the first thought you had. Right. In terms of how to map it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| I'm curious about what are those other options that you look like, looked at that would work from a zoning standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| I know you're saying by presenting that I would assume you're saying you feel like this is the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| But I think the board, we don't get an opportunity to really speak into whether this is the best one or this is the best one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| because we don't know what the other one is. And so to me, if we're going to delay, that's what I would want to kind of see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| I don't think it's I don't think we can just give it to parent choice, because if we do that, then you got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| That ends up becoming your mode. And that's pretty hard way to do zoning long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| I just don't I don't think you can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| I'm you know, I'm concerned a little bit about some of the traffic patterns and how you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| But I don't know what other options were on the table. And I do think that whenever we set the zone, it needs to be the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| I think if we set a zone and some in a group is in it and then we say, but you have choice to me, it's like, well, don't put him in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| Like it. So to me, I think we need to have an established zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| But what I don't know as a board member is what are the other options that could work that we could actually consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| I don't know that. And again, I'm not faulting you for that. I'm just I'm just saying this being my first time going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| It's like, oh, that's what I want. Like, I want to see what are the other viable options so I can weigh them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| And I just don't have anything to weigh that against. And then my question is, I know Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Rizal spoke to, you know, the impacts on school name and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| But logistically, what are we doing by pausing this? Because, you know, things start to back up. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| You've got to create transportation plans and all that. So what are the other impacts that Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| Rizal didn't highlight by postponing the decision even by a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| So to answer your question, we did. We did look. We took in parent responses and we looked at what what it would look like if we took Hayden Hills out of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2653)|
| 0:44:23| And of course, we have the numbers for that. But on top of the numbers, I mean, we still have two hundred ninety one homes in that Hayden Hills subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2663)|
| 0:44:33| As far as I'm sorry, when you when you say two ninety one, do you mean that are yet to be built lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| These are two hundred ninety one homes that are currently in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| There are only thirty six homes that are yet to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| OK, so but you're saying of those two hundred ninety one, not all of them yet affected because they don't have kids in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| But it's good long term. That is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| You're saying it's a population center that has to be considered. That is regardless of the current makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| That is correct. Because this zone is going to live for some period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| That is correct. And as far as transportation, you know, if the board at the request of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| if you all would like us to go ahead and create the transportation patterns, we can certainly do that for that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| We normally typically don't do that. That's presumptuous for us to create traffic patterns prior to the board voting and approving or not approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2717)|
| 0:45:26| But if that is at the request of the board, we can certainly look at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| So thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| I think Mr. Watson said what I was getting at much better is that we haven't looked at any other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| And so it's really difficult to say, yes, this is something I'm comfortable with when we haven't seen anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| And I understand when you say that the staff, that we looked at options, but the board hasn't looked at options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| And I think that's where our reticence is, is that we haven't seen what we are really looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| We see this map and maybe, maybe not, but we haven't seen any other options or those traffic patterns I think that would matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2768)|
| 0:46:18| If we could see what we're really looking at, some kind of this or this, and why we are really here, maybe at our quarterly workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2778)|
| 0:46:30| I think that would make me more comfortable voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| So, and I have a question, I guess, for you, Dr. Adams, or maybe Dr. Islick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| Even with your other options, it's still a numbers game, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| I mean, you're probably talking about shifting, and we might have another neighborhood next time upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2808)|
| 0:46:58| And can I just say that South Knoxville would like a new school, but they would probably all be fighting to go to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2818)|
| 0:47:06| So, you know, but it is, I'm assuming that you looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| I mean, I know there's a lot of growth out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| So, a lot of those areas, I mean, and clearly Hardin Valley Elementary has got to have some relief from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2835)|
| 0:47:25| Yes, Madam Chair, to answer your question, you know, our department was tasked to alleviate the overcrowding of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| and we are currently overcapacity at every one of those three elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| So when you look at the concentrated areas, I know, and it's not a students are numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| That is not how we look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| And I can tell you as a former middle school principal who had overcrowding in my school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| and a former high school principal where I had all the room in the world, you know, that is a huge concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| And, you know, we want to have an effective and efficient school and classrooms and movement and everything that we can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2873)|
| 0:48:03| And when I hear a gentleman say we have 42 students with two teachers, I can't imagine what that looks like in a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| And so that was our original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| This is the why, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| And so when we look at that, we take into consideration not projected numbers, but where we are currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| And we look at Hayden Hills is an area where they have substantial numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| And to make things more difficult, they have 36 homes that are currently being built that should be completed, I'd say, by the first of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2905)|
| 0:48:36| So numbers are, I mean, we have to look at numbers, especially in concentrated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| So I completely understand the argument, but I am cautious that we'll be right back to square one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| because I don't see if we continue the grandfathering in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| And what I'm afraid of is we have to come back to the table in a year, possibly in a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| especially with the growth of 100 to 200 students per year, that we'll come back and we'll have to rezone all over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| and look at a totally different zone and possibly pull in more communities and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| I have more of a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| On a substitute motion vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Yeah, we're discussing, well, the substitute motion was to defer for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| And it was made by Ms. Owen and seconded by Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| And then if that fails, it would go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| And I think the question was asked, what would a delay in a month vote do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2976)|
| 0:49:44| I'm not sure if I've heard that answer yet of what would be the impact of the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| And I ask that question because it seems as if the board is not really ready to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| And I'm part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| That's why I'm not quite ready to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| And so I'm wanting to know what would be the problem, what would be a disadvantage of not making a decision tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3004)|
| 0:50:16| given an opportunity to go back and look at other alternatives and then being able to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| Having a quarterly meeting available to us to also look at this and have a better understanding as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3023)|
| 0:50:31| ensuring that we're responding to community issues and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| And because once we make this decision, if you're going to transfer everybody, give everybody a transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| you just defeated the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| So I would support the substituted motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| Dr. Reiswig, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| If you don't mind, and thank you, Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| The one thing I don't know, and I think you were answering the same question a minute ago, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| as far as like what I was saying, the next steps that get delayed are more like processing with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| What I'm not sure of, and Dr. Adams may be able to, and maybe Mr. Shover will speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| I'm not sure if there's anything on the construction side that gets delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| That's the part that I don't know that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| And you may know, Dr. Adams, we might have to get Mr. Shover to come up and speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| But I don't know if there are decisions that need to be made about like classroom things and stuff like that that need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| I don't think that would impact that, but I would just want to make sure, I think what you guys were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| are there any technical pieces to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| That's the only thing I could think of, just trying to brainstorm a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| If there were other things that could be delayed, I don't think so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| but I just want to make sure that we're telling you guys everything we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| So I don't know, Dr. Adams, you may know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| No, certainly on our side it will not delay anything that we are doing currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| I believe what I hear you all saying is you need to see the population of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| I think it would help you all see where it's highly populated, and we can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| We can provide those numbers for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| First of all, let me say I sympathize with the folks that we've heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3132)|
| 0:52:20| and others that were not here that fell into the same category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| However, what I am a little concerned about, there is no good solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| We're not going to solve everybody's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| You might as well realize that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| Now, if we open it back up, depending on what information we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| we could create a bigger problem as far as involving more people, more uncertainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3169)|
| 0:52:59| and then we'd be putting it off another month or two months or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3179)|
| 0:53:07| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| But keep in mind, you're not going to satisfy everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| If we could see the numbers on the map, I'd also like to see the projected numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| if those haven't been looked at, because I think that's concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| that we've not seen the projections for growth also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| and whatever the Planning Commission has built out, I think that would be useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| Those numbers come out after Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| So we've been in close communication with the Knoxville-Knox Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| and they said they'll be out right before Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| So that would be concerning if that changes what we're looking at significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Mr. McMillan, this is to your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| I think you bring up a good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| and I would just caution the Board and the Administration to do a poll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| in terms of what your preference is unless we're willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| and we honestly think that we're willing to honor that preference at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| At this point, I haven't heard us say, hey, we just want to give everybody choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| So unless we're prepared to do that, I think if you poll people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| you're going to come across as disingenuous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| and you're probably going to cause more harm than good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| I think at the end of the day, this comes down to population centers, traffic patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Although we're all elected by the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| we can't make a zoning choice based upon an individual family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| or an individual neighborhood in terms of what they want or don't want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| not that we don't consider the implications of their situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| But being in social work, I know sometimes you end up doing polls that you regret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| because you really can't honor the intent of what the poll was in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| and you cause more harm than good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| And I would just caution the board against doing that in the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| I appreciate your comments, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| but the only comment I would make is in situations, similar situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3320)|
| 0:55:30| even when I was on the county commission when we dealt with zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3330)|
| 0:55:38| for you to put it off and give somebody hope if it's false,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| if you know that it's not going to help the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| that makes the situation much worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| Ms. Helen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| I agree with all of that, and I don't want to give anyone that false hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| I want to be sure that we understand what we're doing more than anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| and right now I don't feel that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| So that's really where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| I'd like to really see what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| so that we can all say that we fully understand what that choice is that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3382)|
| 0:56:33| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| I was just really going to agree with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| I don't want to extend folks false hope if there's not any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| so I agree with what's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| Because if we were going to vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| what I would say, what I would be in favor of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| would be to include this neighborhood in the zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| but grandfather the existing students into Hardin Valley Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| and that way you address those folks that are currently asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| But we know that with the growth in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| we're going to need 291 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| I mean, from what I can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| we're going to need those 291 homes to be zoned to the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| So for what it's worth, that's kind of what I'm thinking right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| And so I'm kind of torn as to whether to not vote this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| because I would make folks have more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| I'm definitely not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| I'm just in the camp of I'm concerned about offering false hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| And I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| The other issue is, coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| are we going to have a whole other neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| So my question, I guess, to Dr. Adams or Dr. Eiswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| so and I took notes last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| I didn't label them very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| But if we take Hayden Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| I had written down 71 fourth-graders and 26 siblings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| That was just if we were grandfathering in fourth-graders and their siblings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| So if we did, I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| I guess my question is, if we grandfathered in Hayden Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| kept the zone as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| what would that look like at Hardin Valley Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| I mean, as far as those two teachers in one classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| Or do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| When you ask, what would it look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| I mean, like, if we grandfathered those students in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| what would the overcrowding situation look like at Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| I mean, would it still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| Point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| So the 71 kids that would be grandfathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| that was for the entire zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| So the 71 kids is for the entire zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| The 46 kids currently live in Hayden Hills, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Yes, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| So how many kids are we looking at in Hayden Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| So my understanding, Dr. Adams, is if we, so the two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| I think the numbers of 71 and the 46 may be getting confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| So the 71 students are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| if you took all of the students who were fourth-graders, rising fifth-graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| like we'll even Hayden Hills out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| I mean, they're part of that, but they're not part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Then there would be 71 kids who would be eligible to be grandfathered in fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| Separate and apart from that, I think there are 46 students, K-4 currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| that are in Hayden Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| I think that's the number that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| So your question on the impact of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| My question is, is that, if we kept it and we grandfathered in Hayden Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| the students that are already enrolled there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| is that a manageable number for Hardin Valley Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| I can't say that's a realistic number because we have rising kindergarten students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| and you have several homes that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| So that number in itself, I mean, I can't speak to that number exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| but it's, once again, without projecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| I don't know how to address that particular number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| because that's not a realistic number for when we open school next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I've got a point of clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| I think this is where Ms. Christie is driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| Some portion of those 46 kids is represented in that number of 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Some portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| Those 46 are the total number of kids from all grade levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| currently going to Hardin Valley Elementary who live in Hayden Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| So your number of 978 would be less than 50 would add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3678)|
| 1:01:26| if we kept all of those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| So to clarify Ms. Horne's proposal or recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| I think I like where you're going with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| but I think we have to be real careful because it is a population center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| and I think you'd have to be really clear that it would be only kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| that are currently zoned and currently going to that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| Let's say you have a third grader and next week that mom has a baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| When that kid turns six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| just because they're in the same family, in the same household,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| doesn't mean they get to go to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| It is the way I would propose it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| is that it's only current kids who are in that zone, in that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| and even if they're in that same family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| who's not in that school at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| even if you're living, you would not get the chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| I think it's going to be really important to be super clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| That's where I'm kind of going with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| because a lot of those emails were please just grandfather in my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| I know we have one that we heard from last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| that their child was in a track program there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| So it would be the kids currently enrolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| Yes, that was what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| And also, to your point, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| those students that decide...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3762)|
| 1:02:49| I mean, they're in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| So if, let's say, families had other children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| and they decided they wanted to go to the new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| that would be fine because they're in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| At this point, we have room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| so I would assume there would be no problem with a transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| and they could then decide to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| from Hardin Valley Elementary to the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Go ahead, Kathleen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Can we pull the map back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Because I do have another question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| that I'm not sure we've covered yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| And I know the projections aren't out yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| but how do we know in this zone change, if we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| the projected growth in what is Hardin Valley now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| for students to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| Like, what development is going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Because we're already, if we're grandfathering in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| we're getting that number a lot closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| And then what does that look like in three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| when more development happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| that's in that green Hardin Valley zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| that's farther out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| So are you talking...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Well, I can tell you the Hayden Farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| will immediately...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I mean, right now they have 153 detached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| But that would be in the yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Oh, I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| So I'm saying, like, in the green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| what is not yet developed but will in the next year, two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| that will add to Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| and then push that number back over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| And we'll be in the same boat we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Need a weigh-in on that, Dr. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| I'll say, I think I'm going to go way back to the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| of the first thing we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| and I'm going to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| So, you know, when we put this proposal together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| it was, again, for two purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| One, to relieve the overcrowding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| but to give the maximum amount of space for future growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| And I think you guys have hit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| If I'm doing my math correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| and I think this is what we had done to Dr. Adams' part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| on the pre-work on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| if you grandfather the 71 kids in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| and you allow the 46 kids from Hayden Hills in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| that puts Hardin Valley back to over 1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| probably about 1,024 with a capacity of 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| So it gets us close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| I mean, it may not be exact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| but if you account for the 71 and the 46, it gets you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| So to answer your question about Hardin Valley is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| for the area north, I'm going to say north of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| I don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| So I'm saying you've got about 200 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| before you're back at capacity there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| and then the flip side would be if you put Hayden Hills in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| and again, we're totally fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| We don't want to have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| We're trying to put the best model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Then I think for all of that green development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| that's where they think the future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| could happen out through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| You would be opening the new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| with probably about 500 students with a capacity of 1,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| and I guess our thought would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| that over time you build out the rest of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Because I think we were at, back to the numbers of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| how we got, if you had the 71 plus the 46,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| that gets you over 1,000 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| that would be back at Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| and we don't really know totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| what that future growth north of that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| But you then have the school with about 500 kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| the new school opens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| will have a capacity to add about 700,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| and I think that's where projected growth is too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| So, again, every time you add back, and that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| we can add as many people back as you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| or grandfather them back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| but it does, to Dr. Adams' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| mean that we may have to come back at some point and rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| if new growth happens in the current Hardin Valley zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| and I think that's why our proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| was to try to give maximum space for overcrowding first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| to get it back to a reasonable number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| knowing there's going to be more build-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| and then also understanding that green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| is probably open territory for future growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| So I think that kind of gets us to where those numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| Ms. Owens, you may be doing the math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| and getting closer than that, but that's what I'm seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| I appreciate that, Dr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| I think we'll have a little bit more than 500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| I don't know exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| but I think it's also important to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| that this grandfathering, if we should do it for Hayden Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| is at max a four-year problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| So every year, a portion of those kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| will go to the middle school somewhere, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| And so as you're moving in, you're going to be replacing kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| As you move in new kids with new growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| you're going to be replacing kids that we grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| So to Ms. Bikes' point, I do think it's a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| I think it's a short-term issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| and I think that's what I'm wrestling with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| is this a good fix to address a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| and we'll have a short-term cost from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4049)|
| 1:07:37| Ms. Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| To Dr. Roswick's numbers, I'm glad you said those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| because I wasn't sure enough of mine to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| So based on what you're saying, it looks like if we lift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| let's assume for a minute that all 71 of those fifth graders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| are separate from the 46 and just add those together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| then I got 1,017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| So that would still give us wiggle room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| which it's not a lot of wiggle room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| but of 183 students before we hit capacity again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| That seems like just looking at growth patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| that I've seen in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| it looks like something that could even out over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4100)|
| 1:08:38| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| My thoughts, I know the map is going to be a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| no matter where you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| The question is really if we can give parents choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| And I guess the question for me is we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| if we have the capacity to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| because I don't know that we have asked specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| And I know to Mr. Watson's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| a survey that may or may not happen gives false hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| I understand we're not going to make every person happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| in every part of that new district, that new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| But I just wonder if we can get a survey, get a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| and then we have kind of a real data number to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| over the next four years, this number will fall off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| so we can do this or it's well above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| it's going to keep Hardin Valley above capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| And I think that the parents would understand in that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| that something's got to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| And I know something does need to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| but maybe there's enough that would choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| to go to the new school from some of these places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| that would alleviate that overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| So for me, I would be okay waiting a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| but only if we have some new data coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| that will help me make that decision better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| Did you have something, Ms. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Okay, so any other discussion on the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| which was to defer for one month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| And I believe you mentioned discussing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| at the quarterly workshop, which would be the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| Dr. Ricewood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Sorry, I hate to keep talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| but I want to make sure we're getting you guys what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| As part of the, and I know you have to vote on the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| and do that first, I would just, I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| that the staff captures everything that you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| to Mr. Trippel's point to bring the right data back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| So I've heard a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| I've heard potential different geographic options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| like looking at, you know, if not Hayden Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| then XYZ neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| and is there another way to slice the pie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| I've heard, I think, different options on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| like, grandfathering and or number of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| And I've also heard, I think, projected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| what we have from, like, the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| what's projected in some of these unpopulated areas right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| so we can see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| I just want to make sure we cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| so we're bringing back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| what you have to be able to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| So if we can capture that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| or maybe Ms. Coatney can or something at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| so we can make sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| I guess it doesn't have to be part of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| I just want to make sure we don't leave, and I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| As far as what I was asking, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| I can see us looking at other maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| but I don't see that solving any problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| because I feel like it's going to bring another community here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| that's not happy with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| And so I was just looking at it from the standpoint of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| you know, most of the people I've heard from are Hayden Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| grandfathering in not the 36 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| where people haven't moved yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| but the existing students that are currently enrolled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| and what that would look like at Hardin Valley to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| I mean, I can't speak to what everyone else was asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| but that was my ask on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| because that would be the one thing I would consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| but I do think looking at other maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| it's just going to keep...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Another thing, then the other issue with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| is you're going to have two neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| that might be kind of arguing amongst themselves now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| Because if you redraw the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| and this other neighborhood is suddenly in that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| then you're kind of hitting neighborhoods against neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| which is not a good practice either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| So that's where I was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| I don't want to have a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| on a whole bunch of different neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| I would just like to see some clarity on why this zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| and what was considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| and how those considerations played into this choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| so that we can fully understand that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| So I'm not looking for, would you rather do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| or would you rather draw the circle here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| I don't want to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| because we'll never agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| I would just like to really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| how this is what we've come up with and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| I'd like to make a substitute to the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Mr. Dupler says I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| Mr. Dupler, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| Just so you know, I asked beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| I was supposed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| That's what Mr. Dupler said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| What he asked was when's the best time to bring it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| And I suggested that before you vote on the substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| would be a good time to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| What you can do is you can ask for an amendment to the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| You can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| Getting into what Mr. McMillan is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| substitute to a substitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| yeah, that can be a problem under Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| But I encourage you to go ahead and offer your ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| I felt like you led me astray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| I'm just going to put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Well, you can discuss your idea, then we can vote on the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| Well, the idea has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| And I just want to put it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| that I'd like to see that become a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| Now, I know we have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| so I guess I'll offer as an amendment to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| I don't think we can get into withdrawing maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| Dr. Adams, I'm sure this conversation has been an education for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| in terms of what this particular board is looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| And I think in the future, as we consider zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| it would be good to see population density and centers on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| So I would offer an amendment to the substitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| and that is that we allow for any current student at Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| in Hayden Hills to remain at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| Exactly what we were discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Did I not say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| And then we move forward with the rest of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| Is that an amendment currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| or is that a discussion of a potential amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| I mean, I'm happy to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| I thought we'd been discussing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| and I was putting it on the floor as a suggested course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| Mr. Butler, Reverend Butler, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| So my thought of the substitute motion was to delay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4520)|
| 1:15:28| so we could discuss all of that versus putting that in the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| as if we have decided it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| So I would call for the previous question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4536)|
| 1:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| If that's what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| We're just going to vote on Ms. Bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| Or Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| Ms. Owens and Ms. Bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| To delay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Just state the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| To delay for 30 days or for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| Was that the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| And that was made by Ms. Owens and seconded by Ms. Bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| I will say that I will vote against that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| not because I want to be difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| but I think the more you do it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| you're creating some false hope here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| And you're getting more people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| So we have the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| So let's do a roll call vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| And then if it passes, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| If it fails, we'll go back to the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| which was to approve the sub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| Mr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| Yes, on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| Ms. Owens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Ms. Bikes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| That's five yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| So the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| So we are deferring for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| And we will discuss it at our quarterly workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| at the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Item 10E, approve proposed framework for annual action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| plan for Knox County Schools District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4664)|
| 1:17:51| So we have a motion by Ms. Horn, a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| Can we, are we able to pull things up now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| Looking at the action plan, and I'm going by memory here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| because I don't have it up, there were three things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| that the superintendent offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4692)|
| 1:18:22| And one of those was, number two, eliminate disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| And also, under create a positive culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| effective communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| I'm not sure if one of the items there was public engaging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| the community engaging the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| But one of the things that the district had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| was the disparities on education outcome, steering committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| and the alliance for education equity steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| And that dealt with the disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| But I know in the superintendent's priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| did not include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| So I wanted to know if you were able to speak to what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| district will be doing to ensure that we communicate with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| community, with the public, about eliminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| those disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| Dr. Eiswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| Thank you, Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| So, I mean, that is part of our success for every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| to walk through those priorities of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Eliminate the disparities within all of our subgroups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| and our student groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| From students with disabilities to economically disadvantaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| to our black, Hispanic, and Native American subgroups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| that are identified by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| That continues to be our work and continues to be things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| that we're assessed on and things that we're looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| by the state on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| So we'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| None of our direction for success for every student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| will move off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| And so we'll continue to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| We've talked about different ways, and I think in the retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| we were talking about if the board wants to hear reports on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| if they want six-month or quarterly reports on where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| with regard to the annual plan, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| I think those would be great places to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| I think there was some interest in talking through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| at that point, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| So we don't have a problem presenting those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| throughout the year to the board, if that's what the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| Also, as we talked about kind of what my community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| plan would be, we talked about that at the school level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| and that being important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| We talked about the regional level, teacher councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| and also family community councils would be a place where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| all of the work of this annual plan will be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| and input will be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| And as well as my councils, I'll have a superintendent council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| on accelerated learning, accelerating learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| that speaks to that and speaks to all of the four priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| that include that work in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| And then also CEO champions, we talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| and also our principal advisory that we'll be meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| And so all of the work of this action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| as well as the work that you guys will be evaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| in my evaluation tool, will be the work of those committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| and will be the work of how we'll share that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| and ask for ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| As I've said before, it's not acceptable where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| and we need the community to be involved and to speak into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| in ways that are meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| But I do feel that the school is what we in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| can do strongly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| We have a lot of disparities that exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| and we need to do better in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| and I'll say as broad as the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| And so what we have direct control over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| and what we can impact are those educational outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| that are going to change the future for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| And that will be part of that work, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| and everything that we do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| So if I could just ask one follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| The engagement at the school level, the district level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| or the regional level and the district level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| will they be planned or they're scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| or how often will we be doing those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| So our plan will be to start those, I think the teacher one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| in each of the five regions will start in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| and then the family communion will be in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| will be our first two, and then we would alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| every month of the school year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| We haven't made a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Usually in the summer we take those off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| but we'll be alternating months in each region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| the teacher and then the next would be the family one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| And then my committees would be quarterly committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| for my accelerating learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| one that I would have as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| And the CEO champions, we haven't set that one for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| It's probably going to be a quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| It's still developing because part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| is part of the 865 Academy's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| And then our principal advisory is one that we meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| We had one actually yesterday to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| So that will be the time frame for how those will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| And I hope this is the place to ask this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| but can you speak to the region, you have five regions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| and four of them are under one assistant superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4990)|
| 1:23:19| and then one is separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Can you speak to the strategy of that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| I appreciate you bringing that up, Mr. Ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| because I think there's been some confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| in the community about some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| so I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| And that was something that we had a good discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| I think, at the board retreat about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| So the way that rationale was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| so we have Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| who's the assistant superintendent of student success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| and then we have Dr. Wilson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| who is the assistant superintendent of academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| And so I think it made perfect sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| when you guys brought it up at the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| It made sense in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| We hadn't communicated it well, and I own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| So every one of those five regions has an academic team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| Matter of fact, Region 5 has some of our supervisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| of those subject areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| like our English language arts supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| who oversees all of our other supervision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| is on that Region 5 team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| as the English language arts representative for that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| So all of those academically have all the same supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| They have a special education person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| an RTI for intervention person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| a science and social studies, a math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| a special education, all on those teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| That's the same whether you're in the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| that reports to Dr. Wilson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| or the one that reports to Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| Same is true of the other regions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| because in Mr. Myers you have special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| RTI, ELL supports, all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| That is the same across all five regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| They have those supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| The rationale for putting Region 5 in with Mr. Myers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| was around his programming that he oversees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| as everything for school culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| which was Janice Cook and her team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| and the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Special education, ELL, RTI interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| are all direct reports to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| that, again, serve all five regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| But our thought was that we have a higher concentration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| in Region 5 that need those supports and those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| So it's not taking anything away from the academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| They get the same or more, as we're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| in some of the areas we were able to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| an additional math coach and some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| to that region as well in Region 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| because that's where the need is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| the data showing the need is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| But also provides Mr. Myers, who has direct support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| over those other support systems that are needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| probably even more so based on the demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| and the data that we have for that demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| So in no way was it a takeaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| It was actually meant to be an add-on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| Thank you for your response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| One other question was, in the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| since the last meeting, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| we found out that we have schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| that are on the state list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| and they're in District 1, Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| So can you speak to how this strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| will help address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Definitely. Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| We did, unfortunately, with our data this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| I think we have 27 schools that have fallen to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| and this is going to get real educational, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| so TSI or ATSI status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| which means they're a focus school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| which means one or more of their student groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| is not performing where it needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| And again, I won't get in the weeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| on all the different designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| of how you get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| because it gets a little complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| We have four schools that have fallen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| into what's priority status, or CSIs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| is the term for that that's used by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| And that does mean that those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| those five schools against their peers in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| are performing in the bottom 5% on achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| And those four schools are in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| Now, with that comes some additional dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| and comes some additional support from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| also additional accountability on our end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| to work toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| We also, part of this whole master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| is we have Dr. Murphy who runs that region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| again, working for Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| Our whole plan before we got that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| was to work on a multi-year strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| for that region, K through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| And I know Dr. Murphy's been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| with those teams of principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| to think about how do we build a cohesive model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| for the time the kids begin at kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| to the time they graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| that we're thinking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| and we're thinking about continuity of programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| continuity and communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| between the elementary and the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| and the middle and the high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| but really to build out a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| that lives longer than any one leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| because we know sometimes leaders change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| and vision and direction change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| We want to make sure that we have something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| especially in our most vulnerable populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| that actually outlives all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| for a multi-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| So that was the plan before we got those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| and we're not going to move off that course at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| We've had success in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| kind of limited success for years here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| that we've been able to pull schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| where they're not in that bottom five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| but we want to make sure it's a sustainable plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| that lasts beyond just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| I was fortunate and blessed when I was at Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| that we were able to do some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| We were on a state list at one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| and they haven't been back on in 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| and they've had great leaders to continue a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| that we build out for that very thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| to build around students and around the supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| that they need so that we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| the high academic standards that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| So I'm confident again, and Dr. Murphy and Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| that we can get that done again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| and with the leadership that we have in those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| And let me ask one other question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| or one other thing of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| There is a concern in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| about the status of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| So what does it mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| Some are concerned that this means the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| is going to come in and take over or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| Can you speak to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| Great question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| I've got some of those questions myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| so that is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| So thank you for letting us address it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| So when you are a priority school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I think there is that first concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| that the state take over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| and those kinds of things are going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| We have never lost a school to state take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| Other large districts have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| We don't intend to do that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| and that's why we're being proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| to build this plan out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| And so everybody understands this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| Those are typically three-year designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| The state always tweaks things a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| but typically three-year designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| And for a school to qualify for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| they would need to be on for two cycles of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| Now, again, some of that could be changing from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| but not in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| So we will have some time to show that progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| that we need to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| and annually we'll be able to show that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| to show that we've earned back off of that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| So we need to be intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| and we need to make sure, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| that it is a K-12 plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| and it's one that addresses the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| And most of those issues, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| are going to be back to those core foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| If we can make those gains in third grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| it makes fourth grade, fifth grade, and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| a whole lot easier to be able to get that done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| so that we're not doing interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| all those times before there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| So the community knows we're not in a state takeover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| for those four schools at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| Sarah Moore Green is an example of a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| that was on that list previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| that actually earned off of that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| through some of the things that Robin has done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| as a great leader of that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| And so we want to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| make sure that we're doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| across that whole feeder pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Dr. Roswood, I just want to echo something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| that we talked about at the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| So, you know, we, at different times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| and different seasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| we hear groups of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| really elevate their voice, right, to an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| We saw that through COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| We've seen that through other times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| where, for a moment, people kind of rise up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| and say, hey, this is something that needs to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| I think there's probably few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| at least in the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| that has had as consistent a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| as addressing the disparities in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| I mean, formally, at least since 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| there's been a consistent, elevated voice on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| Sometimes when you have a consistent, elevated voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| it doesn't sound as elevated as it once did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| because it stays at the same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Does that make sense, what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| So what I'm proposing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| and what I want to offer again as advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| is when disparities in educational outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| that group, that steering committee became the AEE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| that was a pretty minor shift in strategy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| You're suggesting a very major shift in strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| which is great, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| And I think you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| hey, I want to get at this a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| I think because that community voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| has been elevated for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| when they see a major shift like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| it's hard to bring them along in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| because it's such a major shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| You can believe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| oh, you're not even addressing it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Does that make sense, what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| So what I would recommend is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| the things that you're trying to articulate verbally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| around how you and your administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| is getting at these disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| is to really articulate that in written form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| to do that in a way where the community can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| all right, I see the plan, I see the strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| And also, too, we know that those disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| don't just live in one district or one region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| They really live across Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| in different pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| And I think it would be important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| in the regional strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| that there's a component of each of those regional plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| that speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| here's how we're specifically trying to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| the disparities in this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| and correlate that plan to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Obviously, that plan will address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| a lot of other things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| But I think it should be a called-out element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| in each of those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| And I think that what that will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| is it'll help the community understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| okay, we just jumped on a totally different ship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| but I understand where it's going, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| Like instead of we're just on the same ship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| that just took a little slightly different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| I'm not quite sure how to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| During our two-day workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| we discussed the reorganization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| and we discussed continuing that in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5560)|
| 1:32:49| Looking at the objectives in number 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| regarding reorganizing central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| I want to be very sure that if we accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| this annual plan right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| that we are in no way validating anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| that we agreed to discuss in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5586)|
| 1:33:13| Do I need to make that more clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| So we've...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| Okay, Reverend Butler would like to see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| on the screen for number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| If someone could scroll up there so everyone can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| So the discussion last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| was that we would bring those policies that we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| that were related to reorganization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| and superintendent duties back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| and then discuss that and the current restructuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| and also kind of cleaning up those policies, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| Is that the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| I want to be sure that we are not validating something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| that we don't mean to validate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| prior to the discussion we agreed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| Mr. DuPort, do you have a thought on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| Well, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| I believe Ms. Owens is asking that if the board agrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| to the action plan under 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| and it's got language in there about reorganizing central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| and creating regions...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| Well, yeah, mainly just about reorganizing central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| is that going to predetermine or validate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| or basically make the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| I think what she's asking is it will make the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| at policy review academic, just invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| I mean, that's what she's asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Is this going to predetermine that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| And I think you're just asking for assurances from the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| that that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| Another way to say this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| I want to be sure that when we are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| if we choose to adopt this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| that we are adopting it under current policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| and that nothing here would supersede current policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| Is there a better way to say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| Otherwise, we need to have a discussion tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| instead of in policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| and I'm not really prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| I don't think anybody is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| I want to be sure that this applies to just current policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| and that it's not going to validate anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| that we have had questions about in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5757)|
| 1:36:05| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| I would think that we will be the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| who will be discussing the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| and whatever policies we decide to implement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| this board has the authority to change whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| So I think that's always the answer that Mr. Duplo gives us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| So if we have a policy and we end up needing a change on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| then we would have the authority to request that change, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| Again, with changing those policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| I want to be sure that we don't inadvertently validate positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| that have been created that are not within current policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5799)|
| 1:36:50| We can discuss that at policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| I will tell you that I am going to support this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| I support the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| It's been very intentional and very thoughtful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| and I'm happy to have that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| but it's not going to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| I still am going to support this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| and to support the work that Dr. Reiswick has done for the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| But I'm open to discuss anything if that's what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| I think I would be in agreement with what you've said, Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| that I support the superintendent's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| and the reorganization organizations that have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| so I can't see myself being in favor of policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| that would be outside of support for that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| So I would agree with what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Yeah, I would also agree with John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| I appreciate the work he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| and I appreciate the reorganization and feel like it was a valuable move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| I'm excited to see kind of how that plays out long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| But I also know that we have policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| and if we want to make a change to the policy, we're happy to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| and Dr. Reiswick would be happy to make some adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| if he felt like that was necessary based on policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| But, again, I will support this plan and support the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| Am I hearing that we are not going to have a valid conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| about whether policy has been followed or not in that policy review meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5899)|
| 1:38:27| Because we still don't have all of the information that has been requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| so if we're going to make that decision without the information, I'm very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| I want to be sure that when we vote on this plan tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| that we are not taking that conversation off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| when we don't have that information yet that's been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| So if we're just going to go ahead and make a decision without having any information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| then I guess that's just the way it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| But I would like this board to tell me that we are going to have an honest conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| that we agreed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| Well, as I stated last week, I believe that we have very different interpretations of that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| which is one of the reasons we put it on policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| But, I mean, we can honestly discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| I think my interpretation of it was very different than yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| But, again, any board member or any board can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| and put anything on the agenda and change it with five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5977)|
| 1:39:46| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| One, from my recollection of that conversation at the retreat, I think there was two issues at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| One was the question that you're bringing up is, was policy followed in the reorganization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=5993)|
| 1:40:01| And I don't know that we adequately had that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| and I do think the intent was for us to discuss it at policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| The other part of that question is, are there things that we, given this experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| are there things that we want to change in policy that might impact the way that this is done in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| The question that I don't know that I have the answer to or am prepared to discuss is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| what if policy was not reviewed or was not followed, what would the implications be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| And I have no idea if the policy was followed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| My interpretation of it is that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| I'll just put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| But I know we haven't had a robust conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| I know that I think it would be pretty hard to go back and change the reorganization now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| I'm not sure that you're advocating for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| But I think in good faith we can have a conversation about the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| even though some things have already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| That's my perspective of it, and that's the way I would enter into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| Yeah, I would agree, Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| I think what you're wanting is, are we going to have a discussion about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| We're happy to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| We discuss policies at every policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| and we've decided that this is one we want to discuss and clear up, so we will definitely discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| Again, I agree that I don't think the, in my reading of the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| I don't think there was any issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| I think it was followed and I have no issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| But if we want to clean up the language some, I'm happy to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| So it won't change the discussion, no matter what we vote here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6080)|
| 1:41:28| So I just want to make sure that we understand what 15 is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6088)|
| 1:41:38| So are we saying doing this annual report or this annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| are we going to reorganize the central office again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| Because are we saying that the reorganization has already happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| So what are we saying in terms of, and then the other thing I think, as I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6113)|
| 1:42:06| I don't necessarily, and I'm looking at it as close as I can with the vision that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6126)|
| 1:42:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6133)|
| 1:42:30| So I guess the question I have is, does this speak to policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6150)|
| 1:42:38| or is the policy the reorganization of the central office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| Is that the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6163)|
| 1:43:00| So Ms. Christie, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| I'm assuming that you have that in there as an objective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| but you've already completed the bulk of that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| So there are pieces to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| So to answer Mr. Butler's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| the plan is not to rehaul and reorg the whole organization again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| But to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| I think the way that reads is organize and reorganize the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| the central office and the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| I think that part is that phase one that we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| kind of the reorganization and the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| as we talked about in the retreat, the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| and then the function is the second part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| which is concentrate district resources more intentionally around those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| So I think that is still in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| As we have these regional teams that are now around the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| and we're working those things out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| that's still a lot of give and take and a lot of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| How that's working, we're making adjustments to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| We're getting a lot of positives on those things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| We haven't even done our first budget yet to talk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| What does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Is it something we're going to look at by region?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| And those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| So I would say to answer your question, yes, the structural piece is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| The functional piece to align the resources to make sure that it's getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| close to the schools is still in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| Madam Chair, my follow-up then is that my understanding at the meeting last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6263)|
| 1:44:32| was that there was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| It was not resolved, because I remember I asked, is this resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| It was going to be resolved at the policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| So it hasn't been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| So I could see that the reorganization of central office to regionalize schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| has already been done, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| So that's the question of whether or not that was done in accordance with policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Now, I understand as individual board members we all have our ideas or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| of what the answer is, but as a board we didn't answer that last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| And so I think the question for Ms. Owens is that if we vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| are we saying that we're voting on the policy is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| or are we just voting on the part that he's carrying on as it is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| And if we determine as a board that the policy is followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6330)|
| 1:45:37| and language needs to be fixed to make it more clear, then we continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| If we determine it was not followed and the language needs to be made clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| to see that we need to move forward and we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| But I think the question is when we go to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| is it still considered unresolved like it was considered last Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| We're still thirsty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| So personally I see this as two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| I see this as an action plan that we're voting on tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| and I see that as a policy that we have agreed that we are going to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| and address as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| So the policy issue is still unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| We just voted on the action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| I think we need to clean up the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| I do not feel like the superintendent violated the policy, if that's what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| I did not say that, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| I'm just asking the question, is it unresolved like it was last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| That's the only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| And if the answer is yes, then I think we're moving on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| Mr. Dupre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| And I think Reverend Butler has a point, which is, I mean, there was no voting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| So really, I mean, it is unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| I mean, you all talked about taking up at policy review, and you can still do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| And if you all feel like this is separate from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| you know, I mean, obviously, you all have differences of opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| and that's part of what a board comes together to do, right, to vote one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| But if you're treating it as a policy question and treating this as separate from that policy and action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6433)|
| 1:47:22| and to the point that's been made tonight, if this board wants to take that policy in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| and change it to the point where you don't feel like you have this question in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| then you can do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| So what would be the best way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| I mean, if we wanted to clean this up tonight, is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| Could we put that motion out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| I mean, if people are feeling like this policy's been violated, does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6466)|
| 1:47:54| No, I see what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| And I believe what you're proposing would be a separate motion to take up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| whether or not the district reorganization was proper under the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6483)|
| 1:48:11| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| I think there's some underlying issues, too, that are not quite being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| and I don't think it's necessarily anybody's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| I think it has to do with the timing of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| So nobody wants, in our position, to rubber stamp any annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| Like, that's just not what we're elected for, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| And you, as the superintendent, coming in when you did, you got to work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| And that's part of what your responsibility is, what we hired you for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| Now, as a part of our contract with you, it says we are going to approve an annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| Some of this feels like we're rubber stamping things that have happened because they've happened, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| And then there's other things that are yet to be done that, by approving it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| we would be validating and saying this is our intention for you and the school district, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| So this annual plan has a little bit of a mashup, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| There's some things that have started happening, there's some things that are not complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| and we're kind of ratifying some things, and then we might be validating some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| I think in the future, I think all of us would want, or at least I know I would want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| an annual plan that has not yet been enacted on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| So we can fully look at it and consider it for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| We don't have that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| So to clean up the issue, and I think I understand why the issue's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| is I would make a friendly amendment to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| and that is to remove the second bullet point from Strategy 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| The work's been done, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| And also an annual plan, I think it's important for everybody to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| everything that a district does is not going to be represented in this annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| There's lots of things you do and your team does every day that's not going to be in a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| So just by removing it does not mean you can't continue to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| All it would be doing is saying we as a board are not putting that as a part of the official annual plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| because there's unresolved issues that need to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| So I would offer a friendly amendment to remove bullet point two from Strategy 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6592)|
| 1:50:00| Does that apply to second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6603)|
| 1:50:10| So that's an amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| So the motion was made by Ms. Horne and seconded by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6612)|
| 1:50:20| Well, so, I mean, the board can have a discussion on the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| and then at the end of the discussion then you would vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6624)|
| 1:50:34| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| I was just going to call for the question before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| I've had my light on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| I didn't realize that we were going to have all this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| I guess I'll have to vote against it, the amendment, because, you know, I want it left intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6646)|
| 1:50:59| They can add anything that anybody wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| You can discuss whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| But what's been done has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| And I don't think that it was a violation of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| And, you know, I stated that, I think, the other day at the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6674)|
| 1:51:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| Ms. Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| I don't care if it's in there or out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| I just want this board to say that this is completely separate from what we discussed last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| and that we will have a valid conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| However, we've had so many board members say that they are not willing to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| because they've already made up their minds without seeing any of the information that has been requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| that it really doesn't matter either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| All I'm asking for is for this board to say that we will have a valid conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| and that this in no way changes that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| that this in no way validates anything that that conversation might determine otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6721)|
| 1:52:09| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Ms. Owen, I see them as two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| So I think that we've said that we're going to have a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| I think that's what the board, you know, talked about last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| And so I think that we should have a conversation about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| because I think that, as Ms. Christie stated, we are seeing it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| So we need to have a more robust conversation around that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| And I think that's the time for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| Can we clearly say that this is in no way related to that and that this is separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| and that this doesn't validate anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| Can we say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| I mean, that's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| You know, I'm looking at them as two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| So we're going to have a conversation about policy, and we're approving this this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| So I guess I have a question for you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| And I'm with Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| I see them as two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| But I feel like when you say that, you're going somewhere else with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| I would love to say that they are two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| When I have asked our law director's opinion about whether this would potentially validate anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6790)|
| 1:53:18| and make that a moot conversation next month, I've been told that it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| So what we need is for this board to actually say that these are two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6803)|
| 1:53:30| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| I think what I'm struggling with, and I understand, I think, your intent, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| What I'm struggling with is what is the means by which we would officially say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| Because even if we all make individual comments right now, that doesn't mean it's the action of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| That's why my friendly amendment was to remove it, because by removing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| then it's no longer an issue on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| And we should be able to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| It couldn't validate or invalidate it, because it's not a part of the question then if you remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| So all I'm trying to look for is a means to assure you that we can have that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| without all of us individually just saying we're going to have a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| I'm just trying to look for an official means to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| And is there an action you're pushing for or you're hoping for that you are worried about if we don't say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6850)|
| 1:54:21| I guess that's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| I'm just trying to better understand that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| Since we don't have all the information that has been asked for, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| I don't know what we're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| I don't know what we're going to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| But I want to be sure that we don't do anything tonight that causes us to not be able to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6876)|
| 1:54:45| Ms. Henderson, I think you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Mr. McMillan called the question, so I'm going to call the question again so we can vote on this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| and we can discuss this again in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| It's been thoroughly discussed last week as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| Prior to him calling for that question, a friendly amendment was put on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6897)|
| 1:55:06| So we've got to vote on the amendment prior to we vote on the previous question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| Well, if I may, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| So it was originally presented as a friendly amendment, but then Reverend Butler seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| So at that point, it's an amended motion, and the board needs to vote on the amended motion prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6923)|
| 1:55:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| And is that the question we're calling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Ms. Bight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| She's had her light on before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| Does that matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| I know we called the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| I think that this friendly amendment helps us move forward so we can still go with the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6944)|
| 1:55:51| and still discuss and not have any issues, whereas I think if we don't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6951)|
| 1:56:00| it seems like there's a lot of stuff still up in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| So I would be for kind of taking that off and moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| Reverend Butler, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| We have a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| Ms. Coatney, would you read that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| So the motion is to approve the annual action plan with bullet two under number 15 removed from the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6981)|
| 1:56:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| Will you do a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| Clarification, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| Did you say number 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| Bullet number two under item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| That would actually be the entire motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| So the amendment is simply to remove that bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| And then we go back to the action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| Then we'll have to vote on the action plan with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| So the first vote is to whether or not to remove that second bullet point from 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| Roll call vote, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| Ms. Bight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Ms. Owen, did you want to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| That is three yes votes, five no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| So that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| So we are back to our original motion, which was made by, I think, Ms. Horn and seconded by Ms. Henderson to approve the superintendent's action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7048)|
| 1:57:40| Is there any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| Ms. Coatney, do you want to do a roll call vote on that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| Ms. Bight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| Item 10F, approve superintendent evaluation instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7095)|
| 1:58:23| Motion by Mr. McMillan, a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| Any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| I'd like to make a friendly amendment to delete supporting evidence on performance objective 11, discipline numbers by student group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7112)|
| 1:59:02| How do we have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| Objective 11, under the supporting evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| So do we have a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7149)|
| 1:59:32| So which parts are we taking out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| So I would like to delete just the portion that says discipline numbers by student group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| Okay, that one bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Under the supporting evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| So your friendly amendment is to approve it with removing that one bullet point, the discipline numbers by student group from performance objective 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7181)|
| 1:59:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| So we either need a second to that or Ms. Henderson and Mr. McMillan need to accept the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7200)|
| 2:00:09| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| So Mr. McMillan, would you accept that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| So we have a motion to approve the evaluation, removing that one performance metric from performance objective 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7220)|
| 2:00:34| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| It looks like Ms. Owen, you were first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| I'm confused about how we can address challenges for all students and know that they're being addressed if we're not breaking out those numbers by student group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7240)|
| 2:00:52| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| I'm not suggesting that we not look at it by student group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| I'm suggesting that it not be part of the performance objective because I feel like, and I've spoken with several administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7257)|
| 2:01:05| I don't think that the number needs to be a target number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7265)|
| 2:01:11| I don't feel like we need to be trying to hit a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| I think that just as we have an individual student, academic plan for each student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| I'm sorry, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| I'm getting distractions again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| So I would ask if you would be respectful of the board in our discussion and if you want to discuss it amongst yourselves to step outside, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7285)|
| 2:01:35| I'm sorry, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| I think that our administrators understand that students need to be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| I think that from the administrators I speak with, they clearly understand students need to be in school so that we can achieve the goal, the academic goals that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7303)|
| 2:01:54| However, I think if principals feel like they are being told they need to keep a number to a certain point or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7314)|
| 2:02:03| I think that it plays into decision-making factor, which is what I said last week at the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| So that is my reason for asking that to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7329)|
| 2:02:17| Mr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| So let me understand what you're saying that you want to do under Objective 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7341)|
| 2:02:31| You want to remove discipline by student group, and that's the only one that you want to remove?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7351)|
| 2:02:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| So the other numbers are all right, but that number is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| The only reason, the major reason why I disagree with that is because in the annual plan we talked about disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7367)|
| 2:02:57| So how can we measure disparities if we are not keeping the numbers of disparities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7377)|
| 2:03:04| So the annual plan calls for us to measure for disparities or to address disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7384)|
| 2:03:11| We've got to measure it to know if we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| And the other thing is that this is not an evaluation of school administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| This is an evaluation of a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| And the question I ask is, are the numbers being kept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| And I think the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| So let's look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| One of the things I've learned is if you're going to fix a problem, first of all, you have to acknowledge the problem exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7410)|
| 2:03:38| And then once you recognize the numbers exist, take ownership of it, and let's see how we're going to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7418)|
| 2:03:46| and we keep score or evaluate how we've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| Now, we're looking at the same time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| So if there is issues, the reason why this may have been something that we didn't hit the number we wanted to hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7437)|
| 2:04:05| whether it was academically or behavior in any other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| we can come to an understanding of the superintendent has done his job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| even though we may not have the numbers we want, just like any other level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| But my thing is that if we just approve the action plan, which the three major areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7459)|
| 2:04:31| and the second area was disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| how is it that we're not going to measure them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| To me, that's illogical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| And so I do agree that we don't want to give anyone the impression that they have to do their job by keeping a certain number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7478)|
| 2:04:46| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| But that's a cultural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| That's not a measuring thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| But disparities, we have a problem with disparities in behavior in certain groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| It's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| So we have to measure it to see if we're going to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| We want to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| And I believe in talking to our superintendent, he plans for it to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| So let's see how we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| I have a question for Mr. Hartzell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| I know you probably weren't prepared to speak, but since you're in the room, I want to take advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7521)|
| 2:05:27| Mr. Hartzell, can you identify your role for everybody in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| Just tell them what your role is in the district and how long you've been working in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| Yes, I am Brian Hartzell, Disciplinary Hearing Authority for Knox County Schools and Director of Enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7535)|
| 2:05:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| Would you say that you're probably the person that is close to it, or if not, the most knowledgeable about our discipline data in Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7542)|
| 2:05:52| One of four or five, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| Yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| So you're up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| As far as you know, have schools and individual schools and administrators ever been given target suspension data to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7557)|
| 2:06:06| this year you have to hit ten suspensions, and if you go over, you or somehow the school would be penalized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7566)|
| 2:06:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| So you can also understand, though, where some people might feel that pressure from a lot of different factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| but it's not something that's been communicated from your department or the school system as a whole, as far as you know, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| We have addressed the issue as it relates to disparities and being aware of equal punishment and consequences received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7589)|
| 2:06:37| but not a specific number divvied out to students as it relates to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| Thank you, Mr. Hartzell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| And over the last few years, you've done a fair amount of work in terms of community engagement around this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7603)|
| 2:06:50| and even a few months ago had an equity team that was specifically trying to address this issue, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7610)|
| 2:06:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| And is the reason for that because of our current three-year strategic plan that talks about eliminating disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| is that one of the reasons why you focused so much on it, because you were directed to by the superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| That is the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| My concern with removing that from this performance evaluation, and Ms. Warren, you lifted the same issue up at the retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7634)|
| 2:07:23| is really a matter of output measures versus outcome measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| So I know I bring this up several times, but in my day-to-day life, I'm kind of in the social work business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7647)|
| 2:07:33| and I'm trying to help communities, and there's a difference between outputs and outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| An output is a description or a measurement of what you've actually done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| how many times you've done a thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| So the output measure in this supporting evidence is the number of schools with established whole child support teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| What the district is saying is our strategy to help address the mental health obstacles and challenges for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7671)|
| 2:07:58| and one of the indicators of that might be discipline disparities, is to develop whole child support teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7678)|
| 2:08:05| We cannot measure the effectiveness of that, which is the outcome measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| unless we measure the discipline numbers by subgroup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| If you don't have the outcome measure and the output measure both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| you can't make strategic decisions to move forward on that particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| And so if we only have the output measure, all we're saying is we're doing a lot of a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7702)|
| 2:08:30| An example that everybody would recognize is if you're in Knox Area Rescue Ministries or another shelter like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7710)|
| 2:08:38| 25 years ago what you would have said when somebody said how are you making a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| they would say well here's how many people we fed, here's how many people were in our beds tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| None of those are outcome measures. None of those are descriptions of what changed because of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| They're all output measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| And so Knox Area Rescue Ministries and others in the social service industry have said we also have to measure outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7732)|
| 2:08:58| And as a school district with a very specific strategic plan and performance objectives that say we want to address this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7738)|
| 2:09:04| if we're not holding the superintendent to the outcome measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| then all we're asking him to do is do activities and not help us understand the impact of those activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| So if I felt like your concern was prevalent in the sense of our school system is telling principals you have to hit these targets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7755)|
| 2:09:26| then yeah, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| The reason I asked Mr. Hartzell to come up is I'm fairly certain that's not been a message of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| Now whether or not people are getting that message or not, I think that's a cultural issue like Mr. Butler brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| and we need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| But I just, in good faith, I can't understand how in the world we would remove an outcome measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| and only have an output measure because we'll have no way to know if the output is effective or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7786)|
| 2:09:52| We won't know, and we won't be holding the superintendent to that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7792)|
| 2:09:57| I would not be in support of that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| I'm not in favor of removing this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| However, I do want to say that Ms. Horne's concern is very valid regarding school-level discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7809)|
| 2:10:22| And I have only anecdotal evidence. I don't have anything quantitative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7822)|
| 2:10:28| I know that many years ago, not recently at all, back in olden times when I was teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7828)|
| 2:10:35| we were very clearly told that we needed to change our discipline numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| It was to the point that our principal came to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| your discipline numbers in this class are too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| And when we pointed out, we have a double classroom right now with double the number of students and two teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7852)|
| 2:11:02| Are you counting our numbers the same as the other classes, our two classes, the same as one class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7862)|
| 2:11:11| Yes, they were. They did not care, and they wanted our numbers to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| So that's not something that I ever saw communicated from central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7877)|
| 2:11:24| But in the idea of looking good in the eyes of the district, the principal felt that their numbers had to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7884)|
| 2:11:36| So I believe, yes, we do need to measure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| We do need to see those outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| But we also need to see, we need to hold our superintendent accountable for making sure that is very clearly communicated to administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7904)|
| 2:11:58| And I think that's something that we will have to take responsibility for watching very closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| so that if we hear that that is happening, then we need him to know that so that he can handle that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7924)|
| 2:12:14| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for those comments, all of them. I appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| And I think that we do, it may be a cultural issue, an expectation issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7939)|
| 2:12:27| One of our other biggest concerns is that we're losing teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| And I think that we have to make sure that we're not sending administration and teachers mixed messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7952)|
| 2:12:40| and that we are having even-handed discipline and appropriate discipline to address student behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7960)|
| 2:12:48| And so that's really my concern, is to make sure that we are sending clear messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7968)|
| 2:12:56| And I don't disagree that we need to review the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| So I'm not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| I think that my issue is more that we don't have administrators trying to make the numbers look good, as has happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7982)|
| 2:13:12| And I think there are probably still mixed messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7992)|
| 2:13:15| And I don't know that that's the fault of the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| I think there's a lot of people that are doing various things and responsibilities for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=7998)|
| 2:13:25| So that's my concern, is that we don't have mixed messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8005)|
| 2:13:32| So that's really my biggest concern, is that we hold students accountable evenly across students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8012)|
| 2:13:43| And so that's kind of where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8023)|
| 2:13:51| Okay, and I would agree, and I spoke to that last week, Ms. Forney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| And I'm not saying right now, right, I think that that pressure, be it spoken or not, has somehow been communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8036)|
| 2:14:07| And it's not just this year, but we're struggling with behavior probably now more than we ever have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8047)|
| 2:14:15| And that is, when you talk to your teachers and your administrators, that is typically the number one concern I hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8055)|
| 2:14:25| that kind of disrupts the classroom or the instructional time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| And I do think that that has been the message they have received over the last two, three, or however many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8072)|
| 2:14:44| So I do think we need to monitor it, and I do think we need to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| But I do like removing it because I don't like the pressure and stress that I feel like our administrators are feeling from hitting those targets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8090)|
| 2:15:05| whether it's been spoken or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8105)|
| 2:15:12| Mr. Watson, I think you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| I think we're, at least everybody that's spoken, I think it's been a theme that we're all in agreement that we shouldn't have targets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| and we shouldn't be holding schools to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| I want to echo what Mr. Butler said, that this is not a teacher evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| This is not a principal evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| This is the evaluation of our superintendent who is tasked with developing strategies to, or tactics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8130)|
| 2:15:39| to be able to address our strategic plan and the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8139)|
| 2:15:45| And I do think if we are going to understand that Dr. Reiswick's strategy of whole child support teams is effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8145)|
| 2:15:55| we have to know how it's impacting that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| So Dr. Reiswick, I guess I'm going to ask you, since it's your evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| if we keep discipline numbers by student group, are you going to feel some pressure by the board to create targets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| and send that message to districts or to the school systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| And then the follow-up with that is, or are you hearing that message clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| and you understand that we need to make sure that regardless of whether or not this is in the performance evaluation or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| that our schools need to understand that's not the expectation to hit certain targets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8187)|
| 2:16:34| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8194)|
| 2:16:35| You know, as far as pressure on an evaluation tool, I'm just going to be real honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8195)|
| 2:16:41| I take this job very seriously, and I'm going to be personal for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| I feel called by God to do this job, and I'm going to bring it every day for what I think is best for it to happen for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8206)|
| 2:16:53| I'm not going to feel pressure based on an evaluation tool or anything else for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| So to say do I feel pressure if something's on or not on an evaluation tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| I would have to answer that to say I'm going to do what I feel is right, what I've been called to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| to lead in the ways that we need to lead moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| And I've been really clear with everybody I've talked to with the same message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| and I believe 100% that it is our staff's job from the TAs and custodians all the way up to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8234)|
| 2:17:21| that we work hard for kids to help teach them the right things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| and to help tell them what the right things are for them to be productive in society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| and how they need to interact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| Sometimes kids listen to that, and sometimes they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| And when they don't, I believe in consequences too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| And I'll continue to do that, and I'll continue to support teachers and principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| who do that within the bounds of what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| And then I believe 100% that in grace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| and I believe that our job is to restore people back to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| and give them second chances and third chances if they need that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8269)|
| 2:17:52| So that's the message that we've shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| That's the message I believe in my heart, and that's what I think that our staff is meant to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| So to your question of do I feel pressure one way or another if that's on there or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| you know, this is what I answer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| And again, I don't think I've hidden that at all in my interview process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| when I've come in to answer any of you guys individually or in a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| but that's what I'm going to be about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| Thank you, Dr. Rosway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8299)|
| 2:18:20| I appreciate you answering that, and I appreciate your perspective on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| As somebody who gets evaluated as a head of an organization much smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| a thousand times smaller actually than this organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| I'm going to be led by my convictions and my values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| I also need to know what is the expectations of those who oversee my work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| and for the system as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| And if you're not going to feel pressure from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| I think it's even more reason to put it on there, because if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| then if you say I'm just going to do what I know I need to do based on my values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| we don't need any supporting evidence or any objective, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| If you want to follow that line of argument in terms of a logical argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| so my guess is that's probably not what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| We're saying, well, we do need to measure you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| and we do need to have supporting evidence for some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| And I would say that, again, if this is a part of our strategic plan, which it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| then we have to have a measurement regarding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| At some point, if it doesn't remain a part of our strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| then that's a completely different conversation around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| But I don't know how we can hold you to a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| and not understand the implications of it based upon data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| So we have the amended motion to approve this performance evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8379)|
| 2:19:48| removing discipline members by student group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8388)|
| 2:19:54| that one bullet point from performance objective 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8394)|
| 2:19:59| And that was a motion made by Mr. McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| and seconded by Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| and Ms. Horne made the amended motion, and they accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| I'm sorry, I have a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| This tool had to be discussed between us and the superintendent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| So do we need the superintendent to tell us that it is okay with him to remove that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8418)|
| 2:20:33| I'm asking, do we need to ask him whether he would prefer to have it in or out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| Contractually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8438)|
| 2:20:39| Yes, contractually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| That's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| No, no, we can't take a break right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8448)|
| 2:20:54| I mean, normally I would say that the board can make the motion either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| but because of the contract, yeah, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8460)|
| 2:21:07| Superintendent Reiswick does have to weigh in on this, and I think he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8467)|
| 2:21:12| and I think his response was either way is good with him, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| I'd rather hear that from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| I mean, my understanding of the contract is to bring that to the board, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| My job is to bring to the board those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| and then the board, I mean, you know, again, I've shared where I am with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| If the board at this point wants to subtract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| I'd do what the things that they feel like they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| I mean, I don't have a problem with what the board needs to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| So with that, the board would vote on this motion, which has been friendly amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8502)|
| 2:21:49| so it's just one motion, and so the vote would be up or down for this particular motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8509)|
| 2:21:56| Mr. Miller, Reverend Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| So the superintendent brought this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| He brought it to us with disparities numbers by support, by student group rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8523)|
| 2:22:11| So he brought it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| So if he brought it to us, I wouldn't think he would bring it to us if there was a concern from him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8534)|
| 2:22:23| concerning administrators feeling threatened, and especially after this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| he's going to make sure that the message is that we're going to do the whole child support team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8549)|
| 2:22:38| and that includes applied discipline with all the other parts of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8558)|
| 2:22:48| to ensure that discipline is applied with equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8568)|
| 2:22:53| I just feel like that if this board does away with this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8573)|
| 2:23:00| then you're sending a message that disparities does not matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8580)|
| 2:23:06| because what we hold the superintendent responsible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| we really are holding the district responsible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| because the truth of the matter is so goes the superintendent, so goes the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8594)|
| 2:23:20| If the superintendent is successful, the district is successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| And as a board member, I want our superintendent to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8604)|
| 2:23:29| I really believe we have to really think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8609)|
| 2:23:35| If we put it in our annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| if it's important enough to be one of his three points in his annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| it has to be important enough to measure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| If not, why is it one of those three major points of the annual plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8627)|
| 2:23:53| We really have to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| And the deal is that I really don't take it personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| because I know we all come from different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| But I do know there is a group of people who behavior disparities exist for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8645)|
| 2:24:14| And we are lying to ourselves if we say that they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8654)|
| 2:24:21| They exist. I know they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| And all I'm saying is let's have our superintendent do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8665)|
| 2:24:32| that I believe I know he's capable of doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| We have a plan to do it with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| And also, let's evaluate the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| Let's measure the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| Not just because of something I believe we should do, but because it's in our annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| So I will vote for it because I voted for it in the annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8689)|
| 2:24:56| And I hope that you all will say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| Ms. Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| Being reminded that the superintendent brought this to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8705)|
| 2:25:10| we know that the superintendent serves at the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| However, this is part of your contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| And so I think it's important for us to hear whether you prefer that this be in or be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8717)|
| 2:25:32| Well, I mean, I think, Ms. Sullivan, I've kind of expressed that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| I mean, I brought the tool in as I was asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| And at this point, you know, again, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| I know the board can weigh in and do what they want to do as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| So, you know, I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8745)|
| 2:25:48| To put this together was quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| I mean, we worked hard to try to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| And I think, you know, now we turned around a plan pretty quick, too, off of the retreat to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8753)|
| 2:26:00| So, you know, again, this is, I'm sure it's not a perfect tool, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| it's a tool that we put together feeling like it was true to what we set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| So, again, a lot of these things are things that the board can look at and feel they want to measure different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8768)|
| 2:26:13| I mean, that's part of the discussion all along, even when we talked about it in retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8773)|
| 2:26:17| I think there was a pretty robust discussion at that point, too, about what needed to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| or what was missing or what needed to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| And, again, I think that's where this tool has come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| So, you know, that's why this tool is what I brought to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| And you'd like it, so you're saying that you'd like it to go forward as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| I think my statement probably stands where it is right now, so I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8793)|
| 2:26:43| So, again, this is the board's meeting, and we have business to conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8803)|
| 2:26:49| so I would ask you to respectfully step outside if you want to discuss it among yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8809)|
| 2:26:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| Thank you, Madam Chair. This is my last comment on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| So, Mr. Butler, this is not to correct you, but I do want to point out that the specific measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8821)|
| 2:27:08| that's being presented to be removed from the performance evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| is not in the annual plan that was just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| So the objective reads similar, and I'm not saying that this was intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| and it was an oversight on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| I should have called it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| My understanding was that the performance evaluation measures were going to align with the annual report measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8842)|
| 2:27:30| but they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| So, do you see it, Dr. Roswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| You see on number 11 how it's not there in the annual report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| So I just want to make it real clear for the public mainly, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| because I don't know that this is going to sway folks on the board about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8862)|
| 2:27:46| but I want to make it real clear that if we remove this from the performance evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| there is no measure related to this in the annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| and there's no measure related to it in the performance evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| So we can say all we want that, yeah, we think we should measure this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| but there would not be a place in either the annual plan or the performance evaluation for that measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8880)|
| 2:28:07| And so I think the way the community will hear that is lip service, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| I think what they'll hear that as is the board is saying they want to measure this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| but they haven't codified that in written form anywhere in an annual plan or performance evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8896)|
| 2:28:21| And so, again, I'm not sure that that will be very persuasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8901)|
| 2:28:25| For the board itself, so those comments are mainly for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| I just want to identify that, that I think that's a particular challenge, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| because we've highlighted tonight already, Mr. Hartzell has, through our dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8913)|
| 2:28:37| that this has been an issue and a concern for the community for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| And I know in the prior discussion around the new sector zone for the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8922)|
