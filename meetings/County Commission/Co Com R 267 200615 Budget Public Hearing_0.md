| 0:01:30| I am at 5720 Woodburn Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=90)|
| 0:01:38| I am the board chair for the Knoxville Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=98)|
| 0:01:45| I joined the Rescue Squad in 1980, and I've been around for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| I did spend 20 years in Texas, but I've been a part of that organization all the time that I've been living in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| I moved to Knoxville in the 60s to live with my grandparents in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| And on my day job, I worked for a company called Appra's Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| We managed 43 of the prescription drug monitoring programs, including the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| We worked with the Department of Health and the Board of Pharmacies all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| And on the public safety side, we have a victim notification platform that we have for law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| I say that just to say that I have been a paramedic for a long time in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| I was a vehicle rescue instructor, and I've spent many, many years serving this community, and I love this community dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=150)|
| 0:02:41| Graduated high school here, went to college here, raised families here, went to a couple of different high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=161)|
| 0:02:48| both Central High School and South Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| Shout out for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| My sons went to Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| I can't believe that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| Every day as a board chair, though, what I think about are things that we need to do to take care of the people that live in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| I'm sure you saw the horrible accident in Middle Tennessee last night of a country music singer who lost his daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| flipped a boat trailer in Middle Tennessee, and it's just tragic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| Having taught my sons to drive, and now I've got some bonus daughters I'm teaching to drive, I think about that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| You could be on a boat in the water any day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| You could have a plane fly into a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| You could have a gas explosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| What we deal with most of the time are automobile accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| We had another horrible accident today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| We have about 80 people that support this organization day in and day out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| and I want to recognize a couple of the leaders that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| You may know Dr. Frazier, Chief Frazier, who's the chief of the organization, Deputy Chief John Whited that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| The people that serve this community day in and day out do a fantastic job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| and all I wanted to do tonight was to come and say thank you to each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| As an elected official, I certainly respect what you do day in and day out, but we could not do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| We could not serve this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| We could not take care of people that we need to take care of if we didn't have the resources to do what we have to do day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| We have never been more prepared to serve this community than we are right now today, never more prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=256)|
| 0:04:25| and I say that in that I joined in 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| I know these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| I know the community and the resources that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| and I just want to applaud collectively the group that served this community day in and day out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| but we couldn't do it without you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| and so I'm just here to say thank you very much for your energy and your support for this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| We need you, and we will continue to be here to support the people that we serve day in and day out every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| Okay, next is Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Sir, could you come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| I do have a couple questions, but first I want to say thank you to you and to the organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| to the team members that are with us and everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| You do a tireless job and are really a vital part of our emergency services across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=325)|
| 0:05:34| I think there would be a lot more support across all of our community if they knew half of what you all did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| but I think that's the nature of EMS services is you never quite know until you need them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| and then you know more than you want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| So first off, thank you, and thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| I know you also wear – several of you wear different hats in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| You're not just with the rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| You're with our sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| You're with other organizations, and so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| Could you help me understand what level Knox County has supported you all financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| and then where do your other financial resources come from as an organization, and how are you structured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| Knox County is the primary funding source for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| I might be off $1 or $2, but it's roughly $450,000 I think this year is what our budgeted amount is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| We get funding from United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| That's continued to be a challenge, obviously, in the profile that we have for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| We've been a recipient of United Way funding for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| We also receive some funding from the city of Knoxville, a much smaller amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| But those are the three primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| We continue to get donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| We continue to have individuals that have supported us individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| We've been around for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| That used to be the only mechanism we had for funding, but Knox County is the primary funding source for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| And do you – what does your service footprint look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Is it purely Knox County, or is it Knox County and other surroundings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Well, we serve all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| We continue to have mutual aid responsibilities and supporting, in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| especially specialized rescue with the city of Knoxville, but all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=434)|
| 0:07:23| And then we have, on occasion, responsibility from a mutual aid perspective to serve the East Tennessee region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| And we certainly have done that historically through the years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| But our primary service area is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| Are you structured as a nonprofit organization, or how is it a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| We are a 503C, not-for-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| 501C3 with a board of directors, and how many – do you have staff members, or is everyone a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| Yeah, we have roughly 80 participating members today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| We have funded positions through a mutual aid agreement that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=476)|
| 0:08:05| And then we have a host of volunteers that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| We currently staff three full-time vehicles each day, 24-7, which is phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| And then we have, as you may know, we have experts in specialty rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| So we have a significant number of volunteers that work regular full-time jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| that if a plane hits a building or we have some specialized event, trench rescue, water rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| to support another rescue agency, we have people that will come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| And then we have a substantial amount of equipment, rescue resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| that encompass very heavy technical rescue that we maintain for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=519)|
| 0:08:48| What's your approximate total annual budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| We're in roughly $750,000, I think, annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| Does the town of Farragut provide any resources for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| I should have mentioned them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Yes, we do have some funding from the town of Farragut as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=549)|

| 0:09:17| No, that's simply a mutual aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Mutual aid, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Just as if they were to come here likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| And that doesn't happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| It used to happen more with search, search and rescue, and sometimes trench collapses outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=564)|
| 0:09:31| So it doesn't happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| But if you recall the very massive automobile accident somewhere in the, I want to say, the mid-'80s or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=573)|

| 0:09:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=591)|

| 0:10:34| The property on Governor John Spear Highway, which is owned by the schools, and I believe you all lease it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| I've noticed some construction work going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| What are you doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| That's a conversation I can't speak to exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| I may have to, if I can defer, I can, to our chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| I know we have an upcoming meeting, I think, with the school board to discuss what's taking place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| But that's a building that we have maintained for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| Yeah, I've been, every time there's a call board meeting, I get an invitation, but it's during another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| So I'm not, I'm very interested in what's going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| And pouring a concrete pad and, is that going to be a training center, chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| You want to speak to that or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| It is planned to be a training center, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| And if that training center, will that be open to all departments of the, maybe the sheriff's or the Seymour or Carnes or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| is that going to be an area-wide training facility or is that just going to be a rescue squad facility only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| I'm going to defer to the chief for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| And, Chief Frazier, if you could please state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=712)|

| 0:11:58| The current property in South Knoxville, we've leased from Knox County Schools for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=718)|
| 0:12:06| Rural Metro Fire Department has currently provided some funding to do some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| The initial plan is to do joint training that would be open to any fire department emergency service in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=732)|
| 0:12:24| So anyone that wants to come out, wants the training facility, if it so happens to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| anyone can call you and set up a schedule to come out and do training that's in Knox County or outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| That is my mission and hope, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| It could eventually be a regional training facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Sounds awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| I think that that would be well needed for, you know, to teach these firefighters to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| in a building that's on fire or smoke inhalation, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| So I kind of guess that's what it was, but I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| I've not been able to attend a meeting, but thank you for what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=779)|

| 0:13:26| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| My name is Sarah Bateman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| I live at 700 East Quincy Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| I'm a teacher at Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| I am here tonight on behalf of Kindred Futures, a group of teachers and community members that advocates for the education of our immigrant students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| and for the Latinx Student Success Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| I come to express our concerns about the long-term future of all students in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| We recognize that the financial outlook for our county is bleak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| and we acknowledge all of your hard work on this commission to provide the best support for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| However, we are concerned not only about the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| but the long-term outlook and potential inequalities for our children that the budget decisions will create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| We request that you find means to fully fund our schools for the 2020-2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| After reviewing the budget for Knox County schools for FY 2020-2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| it is obvious that the Knox County administration has assiduously prioritized teacher retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| which we are very grateful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| We are also very heartened to see an increase in the school counselors in elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| and the creation of a newcomer academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| However, we are particularly distressed by the cuts that the administration and the school board felt were necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| The reduction of the funding for the fee waiver, educational materials, and administrative allocations to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| all have direct impact on our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| In addition, the cuts to elementary school funding and the reductions for every single subject area alarm us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| Because teachers already supplement so much instruction with their own resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| these cuts will negatively impact the quality of instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| We are grateful to Knox County Schools Administration and School Board for working very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| to make very little stretch as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| but the ramifications of these cuts could have far-reaching effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| We understand that Knox County faces an unprecedented crisis and that sacrifices have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| Nevertheless, we respectfully reiterate our request that the County Commission and Mayor Jacobs fully fund our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| and grant our children the resources they need to fully embrace their potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| Students will need so much more than just a device and internet access next semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| They will need more counselors to help them process this crazy new world we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| They will need more fine arts classes with enough supplies to teach them to express their feelings through different mediums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| They will need more community liaisons to help make school communications accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| for the nearly 100 different languages that we have in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| While I believe that the Knox County School District did their utmost to provide these resources within their limited budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| their initial findings identified $44 million of additional needs for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| Instead, they had to cut out $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| We recognize that there are no easy answers in this era of economic hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| but the decisions made this year will affect our students for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| We encourage you to delve deeply into a search for alternative resources of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| to remedy the deficiencies we have expressed above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| We recognize and applaud all your research, your hard work, and your conscientious efforts on behalf of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1000)|

| 0:17:31| Unfortunately, our schools are not what they were when they were in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| During the fall and winter, Knox County School staff carefully reviewed the needs of its 60,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| The staff identified the need for $44 million of additional funding to meet those needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| including more school nurses, school counselors, social workers that are to meet the children's needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| additional special education teachers in pre-K classrooms to serve our children with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| better pay for school security officers and bus drivers to assure the safety of our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| improved pay for Knox County School staff so that teachers and aides don't have to take second jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| in order to support their families while supporting our children, and many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| These needs didn't just appear from nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| They've been growing over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| Despite being one of the largest and most prosperous counties in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| Knox County spends 8% less per student than the state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| The state average that includes many, many poor counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| We invest between 10% and 30% less on our students than Shelby, Davidson, and Hamilton counties do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1122)|
| 0:18:51| Do we really value our children that much less than these other communities do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| Of course, the pandemic and the resulting recession have caused a decline in sales tax and some other revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| Actual revenue has gone from higher than was budgeted to less than was expected in just a matter of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| leaving anticipated 2019-2020 deficit or shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| It's been covered by the fund balance and millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| Of course, the current revenue predictions for 2020-2021 are lower too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| Rather than a much-needed increase in funding for Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| the board was forced to adopt a budget with a $4 million cut for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| With revenue down, we might assume that cuts to our schools are unavoidable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| and our children will just have to deal with poorer schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| That assumption is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Sales tax revenue decline is undeniable, but cuts are not inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| For instance, Knox County property tax rate has been cut five times since 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| Each time, our county commission chose to cut the tax cut rather than maintaining investment in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| Now, Mr. J and others are concerned about infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| and infrastructure is also being hurt and other services that our counties because we haven't funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| Each reduction in property taxes made the county and our schools more dependent on sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| If the commission had chosen to retain the 2000 property tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| Knox County would have better roads, smaller debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| and our children would have great schools rather than schools that struggle to keep the buildings clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| This is not to say that restoring property tax rates is the only or even the best solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| but it makes it perfectly clear that inadequate funding for our children's schools is not inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| It's a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Yes, the economy is bad, but we adults need to man up and do what needs to be done to protect our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| We can't always protect our children from disaster, tornadoes, floods, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| but we can and should protect them from harm that comes from underfunding the services they need, namely their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| I urge you to provide the funds for our public school children so they can probably serve our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| All right, is there anybody else who has not signed up that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Okay, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Todd, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| Sorry, I thought I had signed up, but Todd Fromeyer, 1551 Lawrence Glen Lane, Knoxville 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| Mr. Chairman, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| and I'm glad that I get to follow this gentleman because I'm talking on the same subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| The mayor in his video announcement of the Knox County budget described this budget as not pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| He says the last couple of months have been anything but normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| He also described this situation as unprecedented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| The mayor says there's some good and some bad in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| and maybe the sense of this budget is a little bit of shared sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| Some items may be the same as last year, but there are lots of cuts across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| But first, look at schools, the schools part of the budget, which has some serious holes, about $4.4 million cut there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1336)|
| 0:22:25| It looks like from the news reports they're looking to cut 20 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| They say they're saving $700,000 on five-day furloughs for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| There's a $1 million cut from school allocations that supplement costs for supplies and materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| and they're reducing funding for professional development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| There's no doubt that the schools part of the budget is not only the largest chunk of Knox County's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| but it's the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| I think this commission should seek to amend the mayor's budget to fill in those holes from the schools budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| and it seems you can do it one of two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| The first option is to draw down the rainy day fund some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Now, here's where maybe you can answer some questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| In the video, the mayor said that they would be drawing down the rainy day fund by $3.7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| and that would leave three months of operating funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Now, there's a chart on page 38 of the budget document, which seems to show the rainy day fund from 2008 until now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| and if I'm looking at the right chart, and I might not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| that means that the rainy day fund was at about $39 million in 2008 and got up to $68 million in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| The proposed budget from the mayor would take the rainy day fund back to about $62 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| Again, correct me if I'm not looking at the right chart here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| but if that chart does reflect the rainy day fund over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| I'd like to hear some better explanation for why more of that rainy day fund can't be used to offset the cut from the school's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| I mean, we're calling it a rainy day fund, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| When you describe the situation as not pretty and unprecedented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| and you say you might need to come back for multiple amendments to the budget over the course of the fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| which the mayor did in his video, that seems pretty darn rainy to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| Of course, you don't really need to touch the rainy day fund if you can't possibly go below the $62 million that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| There's another way to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| As the gentleman over here mentioned, you raise property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| Yeah, I know the mayor's got this pledge not to raise taxes, but how about some reality here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| The mayor's budget document states that one cent of property tax is equivalent to $1.274 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| In the last 20 years, property values in Knox County have gone up, but Tennessee has something called the certified tax rate law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| This says when your local property assessor says your property is worth more, that can't mean the county gets more revenue from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| so the property tax rate has to go down to compensate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| So in Knox County over the last 20 years, the property tax rate has gone down from $3.32 to $2.12 per $100 of assessed value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1490)|
| 0:24:59| In other words, it's gone down 120 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| So here's my two cents, pun intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Increase the property tax from $2.12 to $2.14 and use those funds to fill in the holes in the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| That's about $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Maybe let the teachers have their professional development funding back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| or that seems like that would be a way to help attract and keep quality teachers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| Or how about you put back the $1 million for supplies and materials so the schools aren't having to scrimp and run fundraisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| and teachers aren't having to pay for things out of their own pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Or maybe 20 people don't have to lose their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| So it's just two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| If you've got a $200,000 house, that's an extra $40 a year, if my math is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| The commission is not bound by the mayor's pledge not to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| I don't think you should just balance the budget on cuts alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| The Knox County Charter says that the commission has the legislative power to amend the county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| and fix all county tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I think this commission should do just that and send that extra money to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| Are there any other citizens who would like to address the commission under public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| I'm sorry, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Mr. Caldwell, could you address the fund balance and the three-month threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| and what that equates to in real dollars, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1587)|
| 0:26:46| I think he was referring to page 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| I know 2020 and obviously 2021 are purely estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| But I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| We've talked about that a few times on what does it actually look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| and what are the requirements from the state or what are our own internal requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| Yeah, let me tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1624)|
| 0:27:22| So the commission two or three years ago at the request of the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| adopted a fund balance policy that requires that we keep at least three months of reserves in our fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1651)|
| 0:27:43| and do this for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| One is having that helps with the bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| So they look at that as being responsible from a management standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1669)|
| 0:27:57| that we have a policy that goes above and beyond what GFOA recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| That's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Two, when you talk about the unassigned fund balance, also known as rainy day fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1686)|
| 0:28:15| keep in mind that this is liquid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| It's not set aside somewhere just for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| And so for us, as we get into September and October, our unassigned fund balance can get fairly low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1703)|
| 0:28:34| Last year it got down to about $30 million, I believe, and while that seems like a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| if you think about what it takes to operate our county every day, that's not really a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1722)|
| 0:28:51| And so for us, that is something that we put in place was this fund balance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1731)|
| 0:29:00| What we said was you should spend fund balance on one-time expenses and not recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| That's basically common sense, but that's what the fund balance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| What happens, though, is every time we issue debt and we have Moody's and S&P do our bond rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1753)|
| 0:29:25| they come back and say that our above-average debt burden that we have is offset by our above-average reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1765)|
| 0:29:40| And so you run the risk, if you drop those reserves too much, of affecting your bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| And if you affect your bond rating, then Ron and myself have to pay a higher interest rate on bonds that we borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1786)|
| 0:29:56| And so I think ultimately we've done a good job of building up what I like to call the unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1796)|
| 0:30:07| And I think what it does for us is it does help offset the negative points that rating agencies look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1807)|
| 0:30:17| when they look at our portfolio as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| And what does it, I know it's a fluid number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| but what does it approximately take to run Knox County Government on a daily basis or a monthly basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| Brian knows this answer, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| A little over $2.5 million a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| So it's a big operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1836)|
| 0:30:45| I think for us this budget is physically conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1845)|
| 0:30:58| I think ultimately not knowing what revenues are going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| And so we may get good news on sales tax for April, and it was better than what we forecasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1863)|
| 0:31:16| But every month since February, property tax collections have been lower than they were the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1876)|
| 0:31:24| Yeah, the previous year for the previous month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| Will tax has been lower than they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| Court collections are nonexistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| Excess fees are lower because if fee offices aren't collecting fees, there's no revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| And so for us, it is true that you talk to the state and they kept on saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1904)|
| 0:31:54| do not submit a budget that's a continuation budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| We don't want to see a continuation budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| And so you hear that over and over and over, and you start thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| okay, we don't do one anyway, but why are you saying this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| I think they were preparing for a budget number lower than what was there for 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| That's what we did, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| And in doing that, I think what we expect to see is delinquency rates on property tax collections to be higher than they are normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1940)|
| 0:32:30| Normally we collect 98% of current property taxes in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| I think that number, that 98% will be lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| And so what does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Then that eats up our growth in property tax growth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| And so if you talk to Assessor Whitehead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| he would tell you that he projects new growth of $5 million before zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1970)|
| 0:33:00| Well, what we said was we're not going to hit our property tax number for FY20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| and we think that delinquency rate is going to be higher for 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| so we kept property tax as a budget per penny the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1990)|
| 0:33:19| And so this budget does use more unassigned fund balance than we normally use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=1999)|
| 0:33:30| It's actually $12 million this year, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Correct, and it was $8 million overall, if you look at all funds, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| And so we've got expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2017)|
| 0:33:45| I think if you look at the one place in the general fund that saw an increase in their budget, it's IT, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2025)|
| 0:34:00| And so can you argue with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| I mean, can you argue putting more money in IT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| I would tell you that Zach's website, we need more, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| And so that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I mean, ultimately, Ron and I sat down and we looked at revenue as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2054)|
| 0:34:23| and I think we're comfortable with these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| And if we get into the fall and they're better, then let's look at it and adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| And that's what the mayor was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| The mayor was saying, you know, if we get into the fall and they're better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| then let's get to December, we're six months in, and let's make adjustments, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| Let's increase this budget and invest where we want to invest in and where the superintendent wants to invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2084)|
| 0:34:56| If we get to the fall, okay, think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| We get to the fall, and let's say UT isn't having sporting events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2099)|
| 0:35:07| Let's say there's not kids on campus at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| Do you think these numbers are accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Not even in the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| I mean, not even in the ballpark if those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| And so then you're going to look at me and say, where are we getting that money from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| It's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| And so I think you've got to take this budget, it's a moderate investment in revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2127)|
| 0:35:36| and so there are some increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| The school has an increased value in BEP, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| And so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| Property tax, we've kept flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Sales tax is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| And so if you look at it, you know, it's not what anybody likes to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| but I think ultimately not knowing what's coming, I think it's the right approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| because, you know, ask Kim Bumpus at Visit Knoxville what her numbers will look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2165)|
| 0:36:17| if there's not your traditional football at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| And then what I would tell you is that has a dramatic impact on Ron| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| because their budget is driven a third by sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| If sales tax is not there, it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| And so last year the growth in the school budget was $20 million or so, give or take, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2196)|
| 0:36:46| That's because sales tax was great, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| And so when sales tax is good, it's good for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| When sales tax is not good, then it's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| On the flip side, with general fund, it relies heavily on property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| Property tax never has a lot of fluctuations, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| That's about a percent and a half growth every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Right now that growth in property tax is down to like a half a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| And, you know, see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| I just think ultimately when we're getting letters from businesses saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| they would like a reprieve from paying property taxes for the upcoming tax year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| you've got to pump the brakes, and I think this is what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| Just one follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Could you please provide a copy to the commission of the fund balance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| so that we're up to date on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| How was it originally determined, the percentage of the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| that is reliant upon sales tax versus property tax, that delineation between one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| Is that something we said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Is that something the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Why has this community decided to tie its educational future to sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| and not to growth of residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Referendum on the ballot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| So in the 60s, there was a referendum on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| where a whole penny of sales tax went to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| In the 70s, there was another referendum on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| where half of a half penny or quarter penny went to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| and the same thing in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| And so basically 72.228% or 13 eighteenths if you like fractions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| is what goes to schools as far as sources of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| And so we didn't set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| You all didn't set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| It was basically set for us many generations ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| And so what that means, and so we talk a lot about, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| the town of Farragut pays 50% of sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| which is what the state requires you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Why don't they pay what the city and county pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| The reason being is Farragut wasn't incorporated when those were on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| So nobody set that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| It's kind of as a referendum on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| And so ultimately when the economy is good, I think Ron's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2361)|
| 0:39:31| When it's not, then he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| And it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| I think it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| We have yet to have a real discussion amongst the commission about tax rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| and a really deep dive into understanding our tax policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| I do think it's interesting that we as a society or as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| have tied our educational system to the prosperity of who buys what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| But you can't change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| If it was a referendum on the ballot, unless you go back to the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| you can't change what was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| No, no, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| I think none of us were there when that discussion happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| But the idea that the prosperity of our schools and the education system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| is a floating bobber is not how you invest in long-term strategies for education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2420)|
| 0:40:30| for infrastructure, for students' well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| So I'll yield the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| I appreciate the time, and thanks for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker, then Anders and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| That's the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| I recognize the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| This question is for Mr. McCoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| The reason I'm singling you out is just because we've talked on the phone before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2451)|
| 0:41:00| but we're now receiving emails from constituents saying, please fund the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2460)|
| 0:41:08| My question is, because I'm kind of a numbers guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| what is the dollar amount that you want to have for the school's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| It's at $508 million now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| What's the number you guys want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| And is that for just this year, or is that for the next five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| What is the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Because you can't say fully fund the schools unless you give us a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Well, I'm not the expert on what the schools need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| But as I noted, the school staff looked at the needs for what they anticipated for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2497)|
| 0:41:48| and they came up with they needed $44 million more than they needed for 19-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2508)|
| 0:41:57| And if they say it, I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| I don't have any independent way of evaluating if the school looks at what their needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| I know our teachers are underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| I know a lot of our staff are underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I know our classrooms are too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| There's too many students per class because we don't have enough money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| We don't have nearly as many social workers, counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| The things that our children need, we don't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| And I don't know what the ultimate number is, but I can only go on what they did, what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| They looked at it hard, and this is what they needed for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| So that's all the best wisdom I have for you on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| So it's about $552 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Well, I didn't add them up, but, yeah, probably, whatever it is, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Yes, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| I wanted to make a point to Commissioner Jay's point about sales tax being driving our education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2576)|
| 0:43:04| Sales tax drives the whole state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I mean, they don't have a property tax or an income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| I mean, there's pros and cons to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| Are we seeing an uptick in our sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| I mean, you talked a little bit about sales tax inside us where we're getting with people not shopping in the box stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2597)|
| 0:43:25| They're shopping at home, getting delivered to the county addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| We're seeing an uptick in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Can you talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| No doubt that Internet sales tax has helped our sales tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| We have saw it kick in from about October of this fiscal year onward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| There's also a bill in Nashville now that would lower the threshold of the Wayfair Act from $500,000 down to $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2627)|
| 0:44:00| which they think would pass the Senate, I'm sure it will pass the House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| that would produce about $27 million more for local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2647)|
| 0:44:16| And if you just do percentages, our portion of that, if it were to pass, is a little over $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| And so your point is very valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| Our state, for right or wrong, has decided to ride the wave of taxes via sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2668)|
| 0:44:38| And so they have basically made it unconstitutional for an income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2678)|
| 0:44:46| And so I think what our state has done is they've relied heavily on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| And so just for us, just looking from 2009 to 2019, which is the last full year that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2693)|
| 0:45:07| it was about $48 million new for sales tax growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| And so that's $48 million new, and property tax went up about 43 in that same time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:30| And so I think ultimately, though, yes, Internet sales tax has helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2730)|
| 0:45:40| I think it has offset, if you look at the collection in April, which we have saw in total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2740)|
| 0:45:48| the state showed a 15% decrease on state sales tax for what they call May, but it's for April collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2748)|
| 0:46:00| We got a report last week that the local option sales tax for the month of April for 84 of 95 counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2760)|
| 0:46:14| were increased over the previous April, which to me is just baffling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| because if you remember everything that was closed in April, right, it's just really odd to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| I think, though, if you look at some of the counties that were down, we were down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| but we were only down 5%, which is not bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| Davidson was down 22%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Sevier was down 59%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| And so I think, though, that goes back to your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| It's Internet sales tax, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| So how many people drive in from other counties to work here or Davidson or places like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| and they actually have stuff shipped to where they work and not home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| And so if you're home, then it goes to your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| I think that's why some of those rural counties saw increases in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| And so it would be interesting to see what our sales tax numbers can continue to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| to see how we end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| If you looked at the Tennessee Department of Revenue put out an estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| that they thought that to end, at the end of FY20, we'd be about 2.1% less than we were in 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2839)|
| 0:47:31| and 21 over 20 would be 3.1% less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| So the state is really indicating that they see a recession coming, if you look at those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2857)|
| 0:47:46| That would be two consecutive years of decreased sales tax for us and for anybody in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| And going back to our conversations and our meetings that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| I think what we talk about, a 2% increase for employees not school would be 2.5 million, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| 2.5. If you just look at county employees, it's about 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| It's about 1.2 million per percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| And I think Ron would tell you per percent at school is about 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| Okay. So, you know, this is an awful budget nobody wanted to put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| but, you know, as we vote on the budget, I won't be here in December and some of us won't be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| but I hope that your emphasis on reinvestment, because the numbers weren't as bad as we projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| for March and April or April-May for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| And so if those numbers continue not to be as bad and our projections are conservative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| which I think they should be, I hope that you invest in the employees first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| because I think that it's something that we had planned to do prior to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| part of COVID slashing our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| So I hope that the next commission, a few of us won't be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| but I hope as we look at November, December and the projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| I hope you reinvest in the employees and find those dollars for that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Just to your point, I think Ron and I were in a meeting with the superintendent and the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| and I think that was our direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| And so I think what we have continued to say is we're going to be looking more closely at revenue and expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2970)|
| 0:49:39| as the year goes on, not only to finish 20, but as we get into 21 than we probably ever have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| because ultimately we want to make what are the best decisions for the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| and that's most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| And they're both really big on investing in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| Thank you, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| Chris, stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Ron, perhaps you and Mr. Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Is Mr. Snyder in the corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Joe's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Joe, come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3011)|
| 0:50:22| How are you doing, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| Doing well, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| The school budget has Title I, Title II money from the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| I think the amount is somewhere around $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Title I is probably more like about, I'm doing this off the cuff, maybe $14-15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| Title II is not going to be that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| And then there's the cafeteria fund, which is also federal money, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| Well, it's a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| So there will be some USDA reimbursements in there, plus user fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| or purchases of school lunches and school breakfasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| No tax dollars, but it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Backing those off the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| can you give me a breakdown of where your budget comes from as far as state BEP money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| local property tax, and local funding as far as sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| So sales tax is going to be almost a third, probably about 31%, 32%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| BEP is, Joe's going to correct me here if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| BEP is probably about 48%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| And so property tax I'm thinking is maybe 20%, 21%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| So those three components are probably 98% of our budget or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| And the BEP is a function of the 6% state sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| That would, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| I don't know the number right now, but I did at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| But of the 95 counties, how does Knox County rank as far as local funding towards schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| Well, we look at that every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| I can tell you that it's really, really low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| At one time, this was years ago, 136 school districts, we ranked 136.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| Oh, you're talking about BEP funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| No, I'm talking about the local portion of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| The local portion is probably, I'd have to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| I'm going to say on a per-pupil basis, probably 11th or 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Is that right, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Of the 95 counties, but of the 120-some odd school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| 140 districts, whatever, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| That's all I need from you two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| I can ask you a question, Joe, if you want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| I'm not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| You're not done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| You've still got the light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| The light's still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| This is to Chris now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Chris, when people talk about a rainy day fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| I think there's a lot of misconception of what that actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| You know, and maybe I could ask Joe this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| but there are two months of the year we do not receive BEP money from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| and part of what that fund is for is to bridge that lack of revenue gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| I know since I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| I know we've been down in certain times of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| certain times of the year, to $5 million, $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| I know at one time we had an agreement with the development corporate, the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| to have access to funds that were in their bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| I also, and a lot of people say it's just go ahead, it's there, use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| It is there to use, but we're in a lot of uncertainty right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| We don't know how fast the economy's going to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| and if we use it all now, we're not going to have it possibly in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| A lot of times that money is used for natural disasters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| things that you can quantify exactly what the end of it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| Where we're at right now, and if you want to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| we don't know if we're going to have to go into a second shutdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| We don't know if we're going to have activity and tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| and people back out in restaurants in the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| So I prescribe to the budgeting philosophy of it's better to amend up as you learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3248)|
| 0:54:16| and as you see what's happening than it is to put out a real rosy budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| where everybody gets what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| and then we're back here three months taking things away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| Let me speak a little bit to how COVID-19 impacts us a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3266)|
| 0:54:35| We have spent to date, just on the county side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| a little over a million dollars related to response to COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| that we feel like we'll be reimbursed for, but we haven't been reimbursed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| And so not knowing how quickly that reimbursement comes, that impacts cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| So when you bring us getting down really low in cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| that has always been in our mind about how quickly we may get reimbursed for CARES Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3305)|
| 0:55:15| and what's reimbursable, what's not reimbursable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| Can I interrupt you one second, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| It's like a property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| If you were to address the property tax and the BEP, how they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| and how our expenditures are pretty well scheduled, but our inflow comes in chunks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| So to Brad's point, we spend basically $2.5 million a day to run our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| so that's never going to change, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| It'll go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| It won't go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| But our revenue from the standpoint of the property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| we collect 88% of property tax from October through February, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3350)|
| 0:56:00| So if you look at what our cash reserves are at the end of February, they're really high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| but then they just drop off the rest of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| And so BEP, they get BEP payments for 10 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| I believe it's July and August that they don't get BEP payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| So think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| No BEP in July and August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| We're not getting any property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Sales tax is what it is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| And so that's why we get low, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| We still have expenses, and so we have to watch for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| I think it's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| You go back to we don't know how low we're going to get in cash, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3402)|
| 0:56:51| And so sales tax is still going to be down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| It's not going to be as bad as we were expecting, but it's still going to be down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| If property tax is down, those two BEP payments don't come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3419)|
| 0:57:07| And then you have other expenses that happen, and then we spend down some of our amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| That gets kind of tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| And so I think we just got to be cautious on how low we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| because we don't want to have to liquidate investments and potentially sell at a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3440)|
| 0:57:31| That's not a prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| And as far as use of fund balance, we plan on using some fund balance to end FY20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3454)|
| 0:57:43| We think we're going to use fund balance in FY21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| We know we've got estimates around what we plan on using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| Could be more, could be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| And so I think, though, if you run the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| like it's recommended that we keep two months' worth of reserves in debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| We've never talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| We've never adopted a policy on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| We're going to get very low to that two months this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| And so while nobody cares about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| it can be a little mark if you're S&P or Moody's to say, well, look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| They've spent that down on that, and why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| And so while we're very fortunate to have a AA plus bond rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3506)|
| 0:58:36| we don't want to do anything that would jeopardize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| and make us pay more interest on our outstanding debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| And I just think ultimately when the mayor and I sat down and did this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| it was let's be cautious, let's be cautious, and let's see how this thing plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| Because, you know, Revin, I mean, just think about it for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3538)|
| 0:59:07| Davidson County, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| I'm not going to pick on them, but I'm going to use them as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| What were they saying in December with Davidson County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| You may remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| We'll take you over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| We're broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| The state's going to have to take us over, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| Then what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| A tornado, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Then what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| And what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| So it was bad before you had a tornado and a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| So, I mean, we don't need to spend all of our reserves down not knowing what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3582)|
| 0:59:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Commissioner Daley, then we'll go to Jay, then Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Just one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| We spend $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Is that on 365 days a year or is it business days of like 245 or whatever, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| For their raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| We spend $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| I think it's based off 365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| I think it's, you know, if we try to get, you know, we're simple here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| So if I try to get into actual days of work, I may get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| So I'm pretty sure it's 365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| 365 is about almost $900 billion a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| Think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| So that's grants and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| It's a big operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| I mean, think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| We're a big, from a, from the standpoint of revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| Ed Schaus has over a billion dollars a year go through his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| It's a big operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| It's just a big operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Commissioner Jay, then Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Mr. Caldwell, I've heard for the last at least two, maybe three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| from my commissioner down at the end, Mr. Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| that we are operating where we are borrowing more than we take in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| Are we echoing that again this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| So if you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| And is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| You've said that statement in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| There are years where we have borrowed more than we paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Borrowed more than we paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Sorry, you're saying it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Are we in that same position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| So I would tell you that the next two years for 21 and 22, that will be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| And the reason for that is for the construction of Lonsdale Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| the construction of the new Northwest Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| and the construction of Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| Those three items lead us to borrow about $31 million more than we'll pay down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3715)|
| 1:02:05| Now, I would tell you to be a little less than that because we'll get premium on bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| and we'll put that back towards the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| But then by the end of this five-year capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| we're only about $7.2 million upside down is what I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| And so if you take all of our premiums and our refundings, that number won't be negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| But we always like to show a gross number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| And with the – I mean, we won't know what future budgets look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| but, I mean, would it be fair to say that as more schools need upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| replacing, or growth in the county continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| I mean, do we see that that trend is going to change anytime soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| I think you can see it get back to what we would say is if we get back to where we're borrowing about $40 million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3767)|
| 1:02:56| which after 21 and 22 we do, then we have the ability to pay more than the 40, so we're paying that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3776)|
| 1:03:07| I would tell you that I think you could get different answers from anybody you talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3787)|
| 1:03:16| You may talk to Ron, and Ron may say, as long as we have the ability to pay, I'm fine, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| And you may talk to somebody who says, okay, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| but I would rather be spending that on operations and not on paying down debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| So you've got both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| And so historically, would the mayor like to pay down debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| Yes, but you also have needs you've got to meet, so it's kind of, it's a balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3821)|
| 1:03:50| But we came from 2011 having about $691 million in total in bonded indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3830)|
| 1:04:04| At the end of this five-year plan, if we stuck to the five-year plan, I think we-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| I think you're referring to page 55 on the budget proposal, just for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| So we're staying pretty flat in that 650 area, but we've stayed flat and built these three schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| and then we also build two middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| So we've done Chaud Road, which I know has been a long project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| So we've done some things, but I think definitely we have the ability to pay about $42 million to $45 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3874)|
| 1:04:44| of your own debt service, so you'd like to keep it below that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| And that represents, I think in this budget, $76 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| which is the third largest budget expenditure goes to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| For sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| And so we preferably would like to keep that number under 10%, which I think it is under 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| But I think, you know, the lower that number is and the more you have the ability to move those pennies to help with operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3902)|
| 1:05:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Back to you, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Yeah, one quick observation or question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Over the weekend, I noticed for the first time looking over the budget document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| the school system's state required reserves is going to be $4 million short at the end of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| How are we going to sit with that with state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| It's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I have spoken to the comptroller's office about not only about the 3% reserve, but also about maintenance of effort, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3936)|
| 1:05:52| And Ron has done the same thing with the Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| No doubt that we're going to fall below the 3% required minimum we expect to end FY20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3956)|
| 1:06:05| This budget also doesn't really meet maintenance of effort, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| And so what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| So we've asked the governor and the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Chris, it would be a nice time to point out that the state doesn't require BEP to meet maintenance of effort, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| I don't want to point out all the state's faults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| So we've asked the governor and Department of Education and the comptroller's office, can you waive these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3988)|
| 1:06:38| Can you waive the 3%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| Because we won't be the only county going below the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| And can you waive maintenance of effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| Because there's a lot of counties like Sevier that relies heavily on sales tax who can't meet maintenance of effort either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4007)|
| 1:06:57| It's surprising some of the answers that you'll get when you talk to some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| If we're going to be impacted by maintenance of effort where they're going to threaten to hold sales tax from us or BEP payment or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4024)|
| 1:07:18| I mean, I have heard, I won't say I've been told, but I have heard, well, just artificially inflate your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4038)|
| 1:07:27| Just artificially inflate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Just add it to a revenue line item to where you hit maintenance of effort and just plug it in an expense line that you'll never spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4050)|
| 1:07:40| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| You're shocked that you heard that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| Think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Artificially inflate your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| Then we won't harm you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| Then we won't harm you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Artificially inflate your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| We've not done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| You know, I've never done anything like that, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| I don't know if you have either, but he can speak to some more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Real quick, Ron, before you go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| So your cash flow is different than our cash flow, I guess, when we talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| It's pooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Okay, so when you're short on your reserves and your cash flow hits, you're on our cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| That's correct, but I will add one piece of clarification on 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| So what we have done is we actually budgeted for the FY21 budget to replenish $4 million of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4106)|
| 1:08:34| So what we actually have done is budget $4 million less in expenditures than we did revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| So we're addressing if we should fall below that 3% mark in FY20, we have addressed that in the FY21 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4120)|
| 1:08:49| So we purposely reduced the budget just so we could replenish the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| And there has been some discussion on if the state were to waive the 3%, I believe that probably would require acts of the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4133)|
| 1:09:02| But I would just say, at least from my standpoint, I'm not sure I would want to do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| Even if the state waives that 3% requirement, I don't know that it would be in our best interest to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| So we actually are very aware that we need to have an amount sufficient for that 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4155)|
| 1:09:23| The state certainly will allow you to spend into that 3% for emergency purposes, and certainly we're in an emergency now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4163)|
| 1:09:32| What they would frown upon is if we or any other school district began to budget into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| And so that's where they would put the brakes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| So we recognize the importance of the 3%, and so we've taken purposeful steps to address that in the FY21 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4181)|
| 1:09:51| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| All right, as we work through here, I'm going to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| Chris, have you got anything to kind of wrap this up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| No, I'm here answering anything that you all may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| We've still got some other items to move through on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| But Commissioner Daley, you've got another follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Yeah, I guess change the subject a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| What's the status on our furloughs and the furloughed employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| How many were brought back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| I think we had, what, 340 furloughed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| We hadó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Do they need to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Just give us a quick update, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| We had about 374, I believe, was the total number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| Lobberies brought back about 103 a couple weeks ago, and there have been some that have come back since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4233)|
| 1:10:44| One of our target dates to bring back employees is July 6th, and so that will be a date where employees get brought back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| It can actually run through July 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| That's when the, I think they call it the pandemic unemployment, runs through July 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| And we've had some employees that have asked to be extended through July 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| And so we'll try to honor those requests as need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| And so once we get done with all those furloughs, we'll try to come up with a calculation on savings, and we'll share that with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4275)|
| 1:11:29| The state's actually paying through the CARES Act a portion of the unemployment expense that you have as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4289)|
| 1:11:40| And so we'll get a rebate from the state for the number of people that we had on furlough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| And so that will help to make that savings bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| And so what that did as we looked at furloughs and what kind of got lost in the shuffle was we were looking ahead at cash flow in October, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4311)|
| 1:12:02| because it wasn't about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| I mean, I'm not worried about cash flow now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| I'm worried about cash flow then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| And so that's what we discussed when making that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| and also the fact that we knew it could be a period of time before libraries or senior centers opened back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| And so we wanted to do what we thought was the prudent thing on behalf of the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| and we do think it was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| Okay, Commissioner Schoonmaker, and then we're going to move to Item 3 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| This was just an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| You were talking about the streamlined sales tax where they're going to drop it from the $500,000 down to the $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| Apparently it was on the subcommittee for the finance ways and means for today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| and they've put it behind the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4372)|

| 1:13:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| Hopefully they'll get the budget passed and get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| Sorry, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| Hey, Ron, I hate to drag you back up here, but since you started to ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| at one point we were at $136,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Where do we rank now on the state's BEP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4396)|
| 1:13:24| We would have to run those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| I can't give you exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| I can speculate it's probably going to be four or five from the bottom, if that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4410)|
| 1:13:39| It's probably accurate, but it's not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| The information or the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4425)|
| 1:13:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| The discussion was prompt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| We had several of our guests speak tonight around educational funding, and we went deep down that, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| But we do need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| And the item number three on our agenda is receive input from interested county officials and department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| So if there are any department heads that wanted to share with us, I'll look to the audience on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| I see Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| So, Sheriff, if you could go ahead and approach the podium and formally state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4462)|
| 1:14:30| I know it's a dark time in our budget, but I'm just wondering why half our room is in the dark here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| It's dark here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| I'll smile a lot bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| It's dark times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| We can get PBA to turn these lights on over your head, or somebody knows how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| I'll be real brief, or at least I think I will be anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| What I am coming to you all to ask you all for is we will have some surplus left over within our salary budget, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4497)|
| 1:15:07| and I'm going to ask you all as a commission to at least look into letting me be able to use some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4507)|
| 1:15:15| which according to my finance director, Alison Rogers, is telling me that we've got a little over $3 million left over in surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4515)|
| 1:15:23| and I would like to take anywhere from 1.6 to 1.8 of that to be able to give a compensation to our employees of $1,500 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4523)|
| 1:15:34| I understand, and we've done what we have been asked to do as far as cutting a percentage of our budget, which we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| It was tough, obviously, and we all understand that times are tough right now, and we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| And let me turn around and say, teachers, thank you all for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| With that being said, I just think that if that money is there, I want to be able to take that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| Now, I understand, too, as has been told, and I know Chris is going to come up here and get on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| They may say that we need whatever is left over to balance the budget, but if it's been budgeted to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| I'd at least ask you to at least entertain that and let me be able to do that for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4572)|
| 1:16:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| I've got some lights up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| There are going to be questions either for you or Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| In order, I saw Anders and Jay's lights over here came on first, so in that order, Anders, then Jay, and then over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4587)|
| 1:16:34| John and Michelle, your lights came on at about the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| So, Michelle, I'll go with you first and then John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| On this subject matter, the order will be Anders, Jay, Carringer, Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| I guess the question is for Chris, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| I mean, it's a line item transfer within your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| I don't know that we would have to approve, but the question would be from Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| So, what I would say, and he's already heard this, so it's not that big of a deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| is, yes, he would show a budget surplus in his budget and salaries of budget more than a salary expense, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4629)|
| 1:17:19| But it doesn't mean that that money is there to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| And so what we did when we went to the – when we entered, I guess, the era of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4643)|
| 1:17:36| we met with everybody and said, listen, and we sent out a memo that said there's a spending freeze, a hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| We're not going to cut your budget because we're going to – we're just going to monitor it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4664)|
| 1:17:52| and watch it because we think we can control it that way without cutting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| So there is truly only a surplus if your revenues are greater than your expenses, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4677)|
| 1:18:05| And so if we end on June the 30th and revenues are equal with expenses, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4685)|
| 1:18:19| and then that means that we have not impacted fund balance at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| he'll still show he has a $3 million salary surplus, but if he spends that money, it eats into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| So ultimately, from my seat, while your budget may show you have a surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4713)|
| 1:18:41| nobody truly has a surplus unless revenues are greater than expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| I will tell you I get departments every day that comes to me and they'll say, I'm going to turn back in money to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| And I always want to say, no, don't you – what do you generate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| And so, you know, so we have to look at it as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| If it was a fee office, it's a completely different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| But as the general fund, we have to look to see, and this is what I've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| let's get to the end of the year and see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Let's see what revenues are to expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| We may be to the good, but as of right now, we won't know because most of our revenue is coming in arrears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| So if revenue was up to the tune of $2.5 million, you could give a one-time bonus of 2% to everybody in county government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4765)|
| 1:19:36| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| Theoretically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| And in theory, you know, if there is truly a budget surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| which is when all of revenues are compared to all expenses, then by all means, yes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4782)|
| 1:19:50| And so that's how we do designations every year, when there's truly a budget surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| And so he's not wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| His expenditure reports are going to show that he has money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| But really, it's not – the revenue is not set aside to start the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| It's how it comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Commissioner Stangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Not getting back into is there money and revenues and surpluses, but let's just assume there was real money there at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4820)|
| 1:20:30| You mentioned $1,500 to each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| Is that each uniformed officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Is that each person within the – tell me what people these would cover, what employees in the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4838)|
| 1:20:46| It would cover everyone in there except for the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| What I didn't originally cover was some of our administrative people, which I probably should have at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| But I'm talking about not giving anything to at least administration, those chiefs and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| our captains and below who I'm looking at, those people working in corrections, those being out on our patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| Those are the people that I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| And approximately how many people would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| Allison, help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| You said, what, 865?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| Well, I always support our men and women in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| And they're one of the few – they have been the ones on the front lines during all this COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4893)|
| 1:21:43| And they were not furloughed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| And the things that they have endured in the long hours and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| So if there's any way possible to do this for the men and women that are out there, I'm totally in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4910)|
| 1:22:02| So I think if there's any way Knox County or that we can come up with giving the officers something that this is really something they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4922)|
| 1:22:12| Because I don't know any officer that doesn't have a second job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| They all have second jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| So I'm in total support if there's any way possible that we can do this for our men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| We need to do it in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Mr. Caldwell, if, if, big if, if we had a budget surplus, we would know that by September 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4952)|
| 1:22:43| Normally, I would tell you yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| The state, of course, has delayed payment of all income tax, excise tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4966)|
| 1:22:55| What else, Perry? Am I missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Gas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Not really gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| So how quickly they turn them back to us will be key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| Historically, yes, by September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| And we may get estimates from them that would give us the ability to know if there's a surplus or not, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4986)|
| 1:23:14| And so I think ultimately it would be great if we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| I just know that if you look at revenues as a whole right now, it's not been, it's not been what we normally see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=4999)|
| 1:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| Commissioner Daley and then Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Chris, might as well just stand up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| I'll echo Commissioner Carringer's sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| I think that during this unprecedented time that, you know, and the Sheriff and I have talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5026)|
| 1:23:53| and the ones that are out, I call them the foot soldiers, the ones that are really out there battling the bad, bad guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5033)|
| 1:24:01| yeah, we need to really take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| So say we get six votes and the Sheriff gives his 2.5 million, was it, Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5043)|
| 1:24:12| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| Whatever the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Whatever the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| What does that do to our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| It technically could reduce fund balance by 1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| I don't think, I mean, I can't tell you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Don't think that I'm against what he's trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| That's not the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| I think I have a fiduciary responsibility, and that is to say what is in the best interest of Knox County from a financial standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5070)|
| 1:24:39| And what I'm telling you right now is now is not the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| We need to look to see where we end this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| I mean, I'm sitting here saying we furloughed 370 employees, but then we're going to give a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| And I think, I just don't think it sends the right message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| and I think you've got to wait until you end the fiscal year to see where you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| and then that gives you a better indication whether you truly have a budget surplus or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5102)|
| 1:25:11| You know, we're not the federal government or I want to say TVA or Oak Ridge or whatever that there's the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5111)|
| 1:25:21| Let's spend it while we've got it and use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| But like I say, I'm with Commissioner Carringer that there's a possible way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5124)|
| 1:25:34| I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| Unlike the federal government, I don't have the ability to print money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| I tell that to people all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| We have no printing press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| And so ultimately, I think if we wait until the end of the fiscal year and see where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5146)|
| 1:25:53| because like I said, from a fiduciary standpoint, the prudent thing to do is to wait and see where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5153)|
| 1:26:01| because if it's really bad, then you've made yourself worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| I don't think we want to be in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| And I appreciate the sentiment, Chris, of making sure we are financially stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| But could somebody speak to the issue of morale for county employees as well as employees in the Sheriff Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| In the middle of the critical service area, people are experiencing, because I like to hear that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5186)|
| 1:26:33| and I also wanted to hear from the library services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| As we serve the public, that really is the first line of response from our teachers to our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5195)|
| 1:26:44| to our county employees who serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| And I just really like to see where we are, because that is who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| And it represents the finest that we have so that people can understand that we are actively seeking to serve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5216)|
| 1:27:07| public's welfare in the best possible light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5227)|
| 1:27:15| Was that a question to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| I'd just like to hear, how are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| How are our people doing in the middle of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| Morale-wise within, and I'll speak for the Sheriff's Office, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| The morale is uncertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Uncertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| And with that, I mean, there's some in here, if they'd like to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| they're more than glad to come up here and tell you what they hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| We've got some patrol people out here and some of our human resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| We've got several people here that hear what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| I'll tell you this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| I don't care to tell it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| My fear is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| And I'm not sure how that will hold up, and I think that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| Just to give you an idea, I have 25 people that are eligible to retire today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| I'm not sure what will happen if that were to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| Obviously, I think you would see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5292)|

| 1:28:14| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| He started to come at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| The morale issues you're speaking of, do they stem from the COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| or the riots and the sentiment towards police officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| All of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| You know, the men and women were out there during all of the COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| Obviously, they didn't slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| They weren't able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| And I'll speak to the furlough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| We did furlough our court officers because our courts closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| I called them back yesterday, so they're back at it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5316)|

| 1:28:44| But, yes, I didn't know if anybody had walked up behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| You have one of your teammates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5328)|

| 1:28:59| Give my address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5339)|

| 1:29:06| Gabe, you do need to give your address because you have a tough night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| I was getting motivated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5348)|

| 1:29:17| It's pretty frustrating, and it eats at you to watch a man like this up here battling for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5357)|
| 1:29:26| Because I'm going to be like I was the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| I'm going to be pretty blunt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| Everything is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| How is this one man supposed to have every single answer to everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| How is one man in a uniform supposed to have an answer to everything in a split second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| It's not going to happen, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| And it's like the things I talked about the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| It's these small things where we can recruit and we can bring the right people in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| the educated people, the people that are listening to how law enforcement is having to change day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| That's what Knox County needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| I told you the other night about how unbelievable our training is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| It's top-notch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| I'll put it against anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| I will take our guys and go toe-to-toe with any agency that wants to go as far as training and education goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| But the one thing we don't have are the key things to get people here and to retain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| Just like I spoke the other day, roughly $124,000 in three and a half years we're putting into one officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5424)|
| 1:30:32| to get them on the street and they're leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| For Bean Station, now I love Bean Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| I ride my motorcycle through there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| It's a beautiful little place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Knox County Sheriff's Office is losing people to Bean Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| We're losing people to Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| I love Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| They've got great pizza at Big Ed's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| But it is absolutely sickening to watch what we do and train what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| and fight every day for this man right here who stood up here and said what he said earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5456)|
| 1:31:06| We can't get help getting where we need to be to get that retention and to get these people in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| I hope I said what I need to say, but the morale is we know this man is fighting for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5473)|
| 1:31:22| He came up here and said it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| But the morale isn't this man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| The bad morale is not toward this man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| It's that we're not getting the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| You go out here every single day and the people in the community, they love us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| They appreciate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| But do they value us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| I'd love to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| I was born and raised in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| I've never been anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| But it's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| It's frustrating because we're answering all these new things every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| especially these new people coming out, 23-, 24-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| If we're not able to give these kids something that they need to keep them on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| and to keep them motivated about law enforcement, it's a losing battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| Because those numbers are dropping drastically who wants to come do this for what we're paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| So the ones that do want to come here, we've got to keep them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| because it's a smaller amount every single day and they're going other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| Commissioner, you had asked a question earlier, but I know Commissioner Bussler has just weighed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| That's the first time his light has turned on tonight, so we've really got to go with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| Go ahead, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| I want to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| I'm glad that government and private sector is private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| because in the private sector, if you do a good job, you get rewarded for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| But in government here, if you do a good job, you just get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| You don't get rewarded for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| If there's some way that if you gave, say, the Sheriff's Department a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| and at the end of the year you said we're going to have this amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| and he didn't spend his budget and you did have money left over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| why couldn't we reward him at the end of that physical year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| But we reward bad behavior by still giving them money if they overspend their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5606)|
| 1:33:37| In the private sector, you get fired if you overspend your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| So what we ought to do is find a way to reward people that are heads of the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| and the people that are in that department that work real hard to save taxpayers' dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| the people in the private sector that pays the salaries of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| we should be able to reward them for their good service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| We've got to find a way of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| I don't know how we'll do it, but we should work around it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| okay, at the end of the year these departments did this, these departments did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| these departments did good, we've got a little extra money for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| It's not a lot of money in the whole scheme of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| but it's something those employees need to know that we value their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5662)|
| 1:34:29| And Sheriff Spangler, I hope we can find that money for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5674)|

| 1:34:39| Anybody else want to add anything in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| Sheriff Spangler, any final comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| I just want to say that's the kind of passion by Gabe is what this agency is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5685)|
| 1:34:52| And just to let you all know that I'm proud to be leading that ship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| but I'm more proud of those men and women for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5696)|
| 1:35:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5709)|

| 1:36:11| It is a challenging time, and with furlough of staff and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| I think staff is doing very well and dealing well with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| Response to our opening was overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| Our first few days were absolutely astonishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| I got to work the book drop along with a lot of other things that I don't normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| But it was overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| Our public was glad to see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5793)|

| 1:36:43| We currently do not have public use computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| and we do not have magazines and newspapers, the dailies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5806)|

| 1:37:08| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| I know all of our public libraries did not reopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| Is it a phased approach of reopening, or is there a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| How many opened out of the total, and how many are yet to be opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| and when would that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| The History Center did not open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| The Lassen-McGee Library did, and then we had seven branches that opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| And it is a phased reopening, and it is phased services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| At some point, we hope that it will be the right time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| to bring back public use computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| We have a lot of questions about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| and also our dailies, newspapers, and magazines, what we call communal items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| So we will have to see how things go and when we will bring those things back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| And so what branches are still not open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5878)|

| 1:38:27| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| And when is the plan to reopen those locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| We'll work with the mayor's office and others on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| to develop a plan for the next phased opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5919)|

| 1:38:42| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| I guess the closed libraries are still on furlough, those employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| And hopefully when we get back, they'll be called back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| Hopefully so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| But there's still a lot of activity going on out there in those branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| They're returning materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| and we're having book drop teams to work those branches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| and to take care of the materials coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| And so it's working well, but it's a challenge for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| I've got one question for one of our department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Commissioner Daley, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| I'll go to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| If you've got a follow-up question, go ahead and finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| I'll change departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Go ahead, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Well, I'm not going to line item anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| I'm not doing a deep dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Don't stick a swab in your nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| Dr. B, your office has been asked to do a whole lot, a big heavy load this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| I mean, it's been hard, I know, both emotionally, the physical work, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| And while I could easily go down the path of asking about morale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| it seems like I know your team is really committed to protecting our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| But, you know, we've been drawing funds from your – you had a few folks that were furloughed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| that were not really being utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| Like, for example, people weren't going to see our health department dentist areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| But I guess, you know, how's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| I mean, and I say it really is a question of endearment to you for all of the hard work you all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| And as we're going through this budget, you know, one thing that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| one of the things we've already approved and sent forward on consent tonight was a line item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| and maybe it's always been in there, but it was like paying for security for your department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| I mean, so just kind of, if you don't mind, heck, I know we've got two minutes until 9 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| and it's late, but I just felt like I wanted to check in with you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| fiscally and otherwise and how your team is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| So my team is working hard and working long hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| We're being very conscientious to allow folks to have time away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6053)|
| 1:41:00| and making sure we've staffed up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| We're really grateful to other county departments that have lent us some of their team members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| so that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| We're working, you know, seven days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| just like lots of other county departments have to work seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| So staffing that in a way, my staff has been creative to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| so I'm really grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| They're tired, but they know this is a marathon, and, you know, they're dedicated to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6083)|
| 1:41:31| They're front line in a very different way than the sheriff's office staff are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| They're testing folks who are at risk and putting themselves at risk of getting sick in doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| and being very professional and caring in all that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| So thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| But they're committed to our mission, and they understand what our role is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| And as far as our budget goes, we were able to meet the request of the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| by eliminating some unoccupied positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| So those were vacant positions we were able to let go of to meet that demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| and made a few other changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| You'll see some other big changes in our budget, but that is part of something really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| Our IT folks moved under Zach and his team, which has been a really great shift for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| and hopefully it's been a great shift for him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| But, you know, their money followed them, so that's happened already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| Chris didn't let us keep the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| He'll be there to take Zach's temperature when he needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| So thanks for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| They're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| My team is working really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6162)|

| 1:42:44| Yes, Mr. Snowden, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6164)|
| 1:42:51| While Mr. Snowden's coming, I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| This department, Engineering and Public Works, there's more with less than anybody I've ever seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6175)|
| 1:43:02| and I brag on this department quite a bit, along with Parks and Rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| never being refused to help serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| So, Jim, I buttered you up to hit you hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| I noticed in our budget here we're moving fire prevention, soil conservation, building codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6196)|
| 1:43:22| codes enforcement, all transferred to your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| Give us a little synopsis of it, why we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| I know it's going to be, I think it'll be better efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| So give us a quick breakdown, if you would, of your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| Historically, that's been in Fund 101, which is, I guess, the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6215)|
| 1:43:41| It's never been in Fund 131, which is the highway fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| And when Chris and I were talking about it, because it's hard to transfer, you know, we're one department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| but it's hard to move that money around because you're separated due to those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| And when Chris and I talked about it early on, we were like, we don't really know why that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| but it makes sense to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| So that's why we've decided to move that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| There is a pretty glaring difference there with position down in 101, but then an uptick in 131.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| It just gives us a lot more flexibility to work as a team amongst those divisions, fire prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| codes enforcement, building codes, and soil conservation are the ones that are moving into 131.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| And I'm excited about it because it gives me a lot more flexibility as that manager to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6264)|
| 1:44:30| just to move money around there without having that barrier of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6270)|
| 1:44:36| How many in all these departments were furloughed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| In EPW?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| Yeah, EPW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| Twenty-two was furloughed in EPW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| Have we called any of them back or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| We're probably maybe waiting July 31st, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| I hope. I need to sit down and talk to some of my managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| It's a possibility that I may be asking the administration to bring a few folks back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| but certainly there still will be some that will be furloughed until the 31st, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| I really appreciate you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Jim, John's got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Jim, how many people now are under your direct department, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| It's around 185, give or take, between 185 and 200, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| I don't remember the exact number, but that's a rough estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| I have a schools question if we're moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| Ron's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| He's sticking it out with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| Mr. McPherson, in the budget presentation by our mayor, he mentioned that this budget preserves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6348)|
| 1:45:55| I believe he said, a 2% raise for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| But my understanding is that that is tied to BEP and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| That's not in this budget, and that's since changed in the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| Could you help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Because I want to make sure everybody's very clear that we're not talking about 2% for teachers anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| So when the state or the governor proposes something like originally it was like in February a 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| and then in March it was 2%, and now the Senate has approved his proposal, which is 0%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| When we hear that, what that really means is that there is a 4% increase in the salary component in the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| And so in Knox County, we are far from being fully funded in the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| We have a considerable number of positions that are not even funded through the BEP formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| plus there is a fiscal capacity index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| So when it's like a 4% increase, when that's the recommendation, that in no way translates to a 4% increase for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| So I appreciate you mentioning that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| So that was part of the governor's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| He has since reduced that number to no percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| which means it's just the same component that they used in the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| That could mean, if that is approved by the House, when the state will run that BEP formula again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6432)|
| 1:47:24| that could mean as much as a couple million dollars less for, when I say less, less of an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6444)|
| 1:47:31| Currently it's about an $8 or $9 million increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| It could mean a $6 or $7 million increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| So we're taking a hard look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| I will tell you that, and Chris has talked a lot about this, that sales tax appears to be trending better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| So our hope would be that we don't have to go back into the budget and identify another $2 million worth of cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6466)|
| 1:47:54| The hope would be that we'll take a hard look at sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| and there may be some capacity there where we can nudge that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| So what we would probably try to do, if the numbers track accordingly and like we hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| we would probably try to cover a lot of that through an increase in the sales tax projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| But that's pretty speculative right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| That's something, again, we would have to continue to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| But I appreciate you mentioning that, Commissioner, because I think there's a lot of confusion there sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Do any of my fellow commissioners have any follow-up questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Yes, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| One request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| I'm sorry, Chris, would you give us the defined services contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| what those totals are for the rescue squad, fire departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| You can e-mail them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| Don't even start looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| Just e-mail them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| They're in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| I would tell you that the defined service contracts are in your book, and I'll send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6522)|
| 1:48:49| The fire, the mayor formed a fire and tactical rescue task force, I believe is the title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6529)|
| 1:49:00| and there is five or six people on that task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| and they will be recommending funding to the mayor as it relates to fire and tactical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6543)|
| 1:49:12| So we don't have those numbers yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| but once that task force makes those recommendations, we'll send those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| Do we know a date when they're going to get back to us or to you, to the mayor, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6558)|
| 1:49:25| I would say in the next week to ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| Would you e-mail that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| First of all, I'll ask the department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| Does anybody have anything you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| If you do, step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| To my fellow commissioners, do my fellow commissioners have any other follow-up questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Our next item on the agenda is discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| We've been doing a lot of discussion tonight, but I think that horse has just about ran its last race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200615-budget-public-hearing?start=6593)|
