| 0:03:00| Their leading member had moved out of the state with her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| They've had some difficulty getting their paperwork in, but they've finally gotten it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| I'd like to ask that it be put on this agenda and voted on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=189)|

| 0:03:17| I guess it would be 12R, I guess, 12R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=197)|

| 0:03:40| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=220)|

| 0:03:49| and I'd like to suspend the rules in order to do that and have that done at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| So if I could have a motion that I do this resolution, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=240)|

| 0:04:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| It better be a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| I never voted on something I didn't know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| This is a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Is this the adjournment of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| Remember, I'm running the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| It is with great pleasure that this council has the following resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| And would Ms. Terry Faulkner come to the stand, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| Or the podium, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| You're under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| You don't need to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Whereas Terry Faulkner has been a resident of Knoxville for many decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| and whereas Terry Faulkner for years has been involved in neighborhood issues in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| and whereas Terry Faulkner may best be known for her involvement in leadership with the Bearden Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| and the Bearden Village Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| and whereas the Bearden Village Plan began in the late 1980s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| where volunteers such as Terry Faulkner began working with city planners, state and local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| developers, institutions, and nonprofit groups to develop the Bearden Village Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| and whereas the purpose of the Bearden Village Plan was to increase pedestrian use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| encourage sidewalks, and create and care for greenways, all for the betterment of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| and whereas the efforts of Terry Faulkner and others have resulted in hundreds of trees being planted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| sidewalks being constructed, bus stops being improved with benches and shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| and appropriately scaled commercial signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| and whereas Terry Faulkner's wonderful can-do attitude and unwavering professionalism and politeness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| made it very difficult for others to say no to her request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| and whereas the Council of the City of Knoxville appreciates the countless volunteer hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| that Terry Faulkner has unselfishly given for the betterment of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Council of the City of Knoxville and its beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| the Council of the City of Knoxville hereby officially recognizes and thanks Terry Faulkner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=379)|

| 0:06:36| Terry, thank you so much for all that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=399)|
| 0:06:52| Vice Mayor, I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Oh, I just thought of something I wanted to ask for before we began the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Okay, moving along, consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| We have a motion and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| Consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Mr. Della Vopi, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| I would like to have us take one item, 11H, I guess it is, off the consent item just so that we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=450)|
| 0:07:39| We have probably all received e-mails and comments from folks, and it's probably appropriate to talk about it when we get to that particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=459)|
| 0:07:50| I would move that we adopt the consent items 11I and then 12D through Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=470)|
| 0:08:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| It's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| That doesn't get voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Just one member of council alone can remove something from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| So 11I, a resolution approving the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance to Total Wine Spirits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| It's 11H, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| There's no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Yeah, and I had moved to approve the remaining consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| I don't know if you want to add those two resolutions we added at the very end, 12R and 12S, to that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=511)|
| 0:08:40| 202s for the Forth and Gill community and the Sequoia Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=538)|
| 0:09:08| For the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| That's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Okay, the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| As you can tell, Mayor O'Hara isn't here tonight, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| She's out of town at a meeting of mayors in Chicago about climate issues where Knoxville was a finalist for an international award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=562)|
| 0:09:31| Unfortunately, I have to let you know that we did not win the Bloomberg Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| but it was still a great recognition of our Knoxville Extreme Energy Makeover Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| which provided weatherization to nearly 1,300 low-income households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| So congratulations again to our Office of Sustainability and all of the partners that worked on that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| A few announcements of upcoming events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Tonight is the final city council meeting for the five of us here on the podium after eight years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| I'll have a few more words about that in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| but I want to make sure everyone knows that the swearing-in ceremony for our five new council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| will be here in this room at 11 o'clock on Saturday, December 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| The swearing-in of the five new members will be followed by a brief special called meeting of the new council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| to select a vice mayor, a beer board chair, and a representative to the Knoxville Transit Authority Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| This will be an extremely exciting day, and I invite all of you to be sure to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| And what I'd like to do is the new city council members or the city council members-elect are with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| We had a dinner and a meeting prior to the council meeting, so if they would, if they'd stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=650)|

| 0:11:03| And let's give them a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=663)|

| 0:11:46| Next Friday, December 15th, is the 11th annual Tour de Lights bicycle ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=706)|

| 0:12:25| Also, I'll read that in a minute, but what I'd like to do now is to deviate a little bit from the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=745)|
| 0:12:33| and call on both our two attorneys, if Charles Swanson and Rob Frost will take over from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=753)|
| 0:12:45| Thank you very much, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| We want to say a few things about the five folks who have been our mutual clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=769)|
| 0:12:59| I had the honor of representing all five of these retiring Council members as Council's attorney before I changed positions over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=779)|
| 0:13:08| and before Rob came on board, and it truly was an honor to represent each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| And I want to say just a few words about each of you, as does Rob, and I think there may be a gift or two involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=793)|
| 0:13:22| But at any rate, I just wanted to speak for a few moments about friends of ours who we have lived with for the last eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=802)|
| 0:13:33| and have enjoyed so much the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| And I can tell you right now that Brenda Palmer would rather be at a dentist's office right now than for this to be going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=819)|
| 0:13:51| Brenda does not like personal notoriety, and I recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| And so I'm just going to have to give her one more piece of legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| and that piece of legal advice, Brenda, is just pretend you're at the dentist's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| And this is going to be over very shortly, particularly for you because I know you hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=847)|
| 0:14:15| But I do want to say how much we do appreciate the service that Brenda has brought to this Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| and to the citizens and residents of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| She has been an amazing member of the beer board and the chair of the beer board during her entire time with the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=866)|
| 0:14:39| She has been a no-nonsense leader of the beer board, which is very consistent with her previous life as an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=879)|
| 0:14:52| And she has been very careful as chair of the beer board to make sure that we care about children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| that we care that underage persons do not get served as they should not get served for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=899)|
| 0:15:07| She has been very, very careful about that, and she has gone out of her way on numerous occasions to make sure that that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| We have been grateful to her for both her intellect and for her common sense approach to governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=915)|
| 0:15:23| and we have all benefited from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| And, Brenda, we are going to miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| I'd like to add that whoever is going to be the next beer board chair is going to have some big shoes to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Of the nine members of Council, the person I speak with far and away most has been the beer board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=934)|
| 0:15:43| People really don't realize how much goes on with restaurants and bars and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| and, unfortunately, how much they can mess up or, when they're applying, how they don't do things right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| and they come with different excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| I can't imagine how many phone calls and e-mails Brenda Palmer has received over the years as beer board chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=960)|
| 0:16:10| and that's on top of being a responsible Council representative to the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| It's a job on top of a job, and she handled it very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| and we will definitely miss her leadership on Council and, in particular, as the beer board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Now, moving on to Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=992)|
| 0:16:43| It has been such a tremendous pleasure to be just associated with Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| His style of quiet leadership and effective leadership has been a real example for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1009)|
| 0:17:00| That we have been proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| As you all know, Mayor Brown was the first African American mayor of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1022)|
| 0:17:12| when he agreed, despite his better judgment, to serve in that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| when Governor Haslam withdrew from the mayor's position to run for the governor's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| And Mayor Brown stepped into that position and did just a marvelous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| And we talk about Mayor Brown serving as the first African American mayor of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| but we don't think about what that really means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| And I think we should. We should think about what that really means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| And what that really means is that for a whole generation of African Americans in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1067)|
| 0:17:56| they now know what is possible because of what Mayor Brown has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| because of the role model he has been and continues to be for them in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| We cannot repay that type of debt to Mayor Brown, but we can be grateful for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| and we want to express that gratitude tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| So Mayor Brown, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| To echo a little bit of what Charles had, I would say Dan was a thoughtful person providing thoughtful representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1105)|
| 0:18:34| When people approached him with issues, he was known for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| As everybody is well aware, we just had an overlay issue that became a dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| But it was Dan Brown, Mayor Brown, who listened to people who wanted to have that issue discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| that started the ball rolling, and though he ultimately disagreed with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| he was willing to let those who wanted to have an issue debated to be brought forward where it was debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| So even though he's departing, I will miss my phone calls with him, particularly about baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1144)|
| 0:19:12| But Dan has been just a wonderful person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| He'll have more time with Kathy now, but we will miss Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1158)|
| 0:19:28| I'm going to move on around to Mr. Della Volpe next because Vice Mayor Greene pointed out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1168)|
| 0:19:36| that he's now serving as mayor, and so he can fire me because I serve at the pleasure of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| And so I'm going to save him for last so that when he fires me, then I can just walk on out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| Now, some of you may be surprised to see me saying nice things about Mr. Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| But that should not be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| Truly consistent with his history as a recovering lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| it is true that Mr. Della Volpe never met a controversy that he was willing to walk away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| And I admire that. As a lawyer myself, I admire that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| I also admire the fact that he took it as part of his responsibility as a council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| to provide an educational role to the public and to those who attended this meeting, both in person and on the TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1226)|
| 0:20:37| by making sure people understood what was being considered by council at the time it was being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1237)|
| 0:20:45| And I can say that when Mr. Della Volpe sometimes had me at the sharp end of his verbal sword,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1245)|
| 0:21:01| I always knew that he was very sincere about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| He was sincere about a number of things. He was very sincere about being fiscally prudent in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1265)|
| 0:21:14| Sometimes I felt like he was being obsessed with being fiscally prudent with this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| because he always felt like any project that we engaged in, no matter what that project might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| that we could probably, if we just thought about it a little bit, we could accomplish that project with two men and a truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| Sometimes a hammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Sometimes a hammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| And so I will remember that about Mr. Della Volpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| but the one enduring memory that I think that maybe I have that no one else has about Mr. Della Volpe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| speaks volume about him and who he is and what he has meant to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| The one enduring memory that I have of Mr. Della Volpe is on, I guess, multiple Saturday mornings in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1318)|
| 0:22:08| I would be driving around going from here to there and I would see Mr. Della Volpe at Tank Strickland Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| and he would have his car out there and he would have rakes and he would have other tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| and he would be out there by himself caring for that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| I had my dog, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Him and his dog out there caring for the park and caring for his community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| because he does and he has cared for this community in a very impressive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| And Mr. Della Volpe, despite all of our previous differences, I want to thank you for your service to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| I was thinking the first time I met Nick was probably 17 to 18 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1367)|
| 0:22:58| when he was in front of the Kroger's on Broadway gathering signatures for a petition to ban new billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1378)|
| 0:23:15| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| And if you walked within earshot of Nick, which was about 100 yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| he would call you over and explain the situation why the beautification of Knoxville was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| and he felt that the city of Knoxville did not need any new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| And thanks to his efforts and the efforts of many people, all new billboards were banned shortly thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1415)|
| 0:23:44| So Nick has also, as Charles mentioned, been greatly involved in community parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| trees, planting magnolias on Magnolia Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| and just the general betterment and feel of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| He cares deeply about Town Hall East, Holston Hills, Chilhowie Hills, and the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| He's someone who will be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| Since Mr. Pavlis is not here tonight, he's not going to have to endure this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| And so our last bit of conversation will be about Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| I actually have a statement from Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| I guess what I would say I remember and am going to remember most about Vice Mayor Grieve is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1475)|
| 0:24:49| as the leader of this council, as Vice Mayor of this council, he has been persistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1489)|
| 0:24:59| He has been a man of vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| He has had a vision in his mind about the city of Knoxville that he thinks is appropriate for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1502)|
| 0:25:11| and that many of us agree with that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| And he has been persistent in following through in efforts to make that vision come true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| You will all remember the many years, I think it was three, but it seems like 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| that he worked very diligently through putting together the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| and bringing that to fruition along with your all's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| It was a tremendous work that Vice Mayor Grieve did with respect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| And he had the eye to detail that an architect has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| and he kept his eye on the ball with regard to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| And he was persistent with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| He has also been persistent, of course, with the short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| As you will see tonight, he's not done being persistent with the short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| And all of the things that he has done for the city of Knoxville, for his leadership to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| we are all so grateful and we thank him for his devotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| and for the many ways in which he has led this city to be a better place for the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1582)|
| 0:26:37| I've had the pleasure of knowing Dwayne long before he served on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| He was in the same office building as my late father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| but I also knew Dwayne through Historic Preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| whether it was Victor Ashe's task force on Historic Preservation or the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| As Charles most aptly put it, Dwayne, being an architect, has served this city well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| Long before he was on council, go down Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Take a look at the rehabilitated Millers Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| that had been clad in reflective plexiglass for how many decades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| Dwayne led that. Dwayne got that building looking as great as it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| and absolutely positively transformed Gay Street and downtown Knoxville for the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| Dwayne also volunteered his time in contentious zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| One on Lions View Pike rings a bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| where he selflessly gave up his time and his professional expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| to try to find a solution to a sticky problem that the city was facing long before he was on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| As Charles mentioned, the sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Dwayne's been a driving force for trying to get more sidewalks, less signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| No matter what part of the city that, even though he doesn't serve specifically outside the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| he wants to see the best for all parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| And for that, we will miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| Well, let me briefly, Nick Pavlis called me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| Councilman Pavlis and former Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| He was sad that he was not able to come to tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| It really touched him, but he had work obligations that he absolutely just could not avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| He sent me a note, which he asked me to read to everyone, which I'll do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Due to unforeseen business travel, I will not be able to attend tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| I regret not being present for this meeting in particular, since it is my last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| I would, however, like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Thank you for your unending and abundant support for all the projects I have brought forward to help the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| I would also like to thank the staff for your patience and attentiveness in fielding hundreds and hundreds of emails and calls on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1742)|
| 0:29:10| You have successfully upheld the highest standards of the Council Office by providing outstanding service to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| And, of course, I would like to thank my fellow Council members for their productive eight years that we have served together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| I enjoyed being part of such an effective team and proud to know that we collectively accomplished so much to make Knoxville a better city in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| I leave you with the wise and inspiring words of my friend, Rob Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| You had every right to be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| Most importantly, I want to thank the citizens of Knoxville for giving me the honor and privilege to serve as Councilman for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| Since my first years on Council, I have been delighted to see our city grow and flourish into the Knoxville we now know today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| Thank you for allowing me to be part of such an exciting and memorable process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| And lastly, to all the new elected Council members, don't mess things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| Happy trails. I'll see you around town. Thank you. Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1805)|
| 0:30:15| Then one last thing, because I promised them gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| If you see the white signs in front of those who are departing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| what that means is their name tags have been removed for the last couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| so that Will and the Recorder's Office could put together a lovely gift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| which is a certificate that includes the name tag that was in front of them for the entire time that they were here serving as Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1839)|
| 0:30:48| And each member who is retiring from the City Council will receive a certificate that looks like this one that Will is showing off right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1848)|
| 0:30:59| So, Will, if you would pass those out, I'd very much appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| As Will is passing those out, I'd like to just say a few things myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| I'd like the community to know that it's been an honor to serve, and especially with this Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| It's been an honor to be with this group of people. I'm going to miss each and every one of you, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| But I know what my eventual Tuesdays are going to be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| But I do appreciate the kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| And I want to say that it's been a joy to be part of a thoughtful and respectful and hardworking Council that this group has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1893)|
| 0:31:43| I think that we're leaving the city after eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| I think it's better today than what it was eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| To the future Council, I know in four years that it's going to be even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| There's a lot of things going on, and there's a lot of things that we can be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| And so, again, I just want to say to the administration that I've enjoyed working with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| I don't want to start naming names because I know I'll leave someone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| I want to thank my colleagues, those that are leaving and those that are staying, that it's been a wonderful ride, you might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1929)|
| 0:32:17| And also just the personnel and the people, the employees at the city have been fantastic to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| It's a great group, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| They're conscientious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| They work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| And as a City Council person, they certainly all, from the department heads down, respond to our request and what we have to ask for, you know, for our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1948)|
| 0:32:38| So I want to thank all of you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| And with that, if any of the other Council members that are leaving would like to say something, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| It looks like the mayor is turning on his light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| I would like to say a couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| First of all, I see my wife is here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| I want to thank her for her support during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| And when I served as the first African-American mayor, she also served as the first African-American First Lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| And she did an outstanding job in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| She served with grace and dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Let's have her stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Give her a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| It's certainly been my honor to serve in this capacity on this Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| And it's been a blessing to serve, and it's been a joy sometimes, not all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| But I've enjoyed getting to know the people that I was elected with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| And we've had civility through most of these proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| And I would like to thank a couple of people when I was elected by this Council to serve as a mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2030)|
| 0:33:58| I'd like to thank Dr. Lyons, who I work with very closely, and also in absentia Mr. Larry Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| I work with them very closely, and I think we had lunch just about every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| And I wanted to thank them for their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| So I thank you for allowing me to serve, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| Oh, can I make an announcement now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| I have an announcement, but I'll do that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| I'll call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Brenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| I want to thank the people of the 3rd District for their confidence and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| It's been a pleasure to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| We've had generally calm times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| That district is not as intense as some other districts, such as Councilman Grieve serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| But we have had a couple of really hot-button issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| My biggest disappointment during the time on Council is that Western Avenue is not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| The pedestrian bridge has been a fiasco from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| But hopefully it will be completed during someone's lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| I doubt if it will be mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| But I do think that the Western Avenue with the sidewalks is a huge improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| and the Cumberland Estates area and some of the other neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| will certainly appreciate and value from the better accessibility of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| That project has been 50 years in the making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| so I guess eight years for the widening is not an unreasonable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| I'd also like to thank Mr. Palmer, who has been beside me, behind me, pushing from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2127)|
| 0:35:36| He doesn't push so much anymore, but he's definitely a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| I'd also like to thank Jim Jennings, who has always not agreed with me, but we've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| I remember when we first came to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Mr. Swanson really beat us over the head about some things that we needed to never do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| But mostly we have remembered those things, and I appreciate that, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| I want to thank all of you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| Thank you, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| I also would like to introduce my wife, Marcia, who has, just like Kathy and also Stephanie Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2169)|
| 0:36:18| Why don't you two stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| I'm sorry, Stephanie Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| Stephanie Welsh is over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| You can stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| I think all three of those ladies sitting there can tell you what it takes for a person to be on Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| and how important it is to have their support and backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| They do a tremendous job, and they really are our right hand in all that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| So, ladies, thank you, and Marcia, thank you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| I'll give you a nickel's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| I don't want to take too much time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| I just want to thank the people of the 4th District, who I think really, really try hard to build their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2216)|
| 0:37:04| and their neighborhoods, and to the extent I could serve them, it was my pleasure to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| and I appreciate all the neighborhood groups and the hard work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| And I would be remiss if I did not thank Ms. Donna Dela Voopi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| who fielded a lot of phone calls when I wasn't at the house or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| and reminded me of various things I needed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| I know it takes a toll on the spouses to be in a support role, but I appreciate the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| So thank you all for voting for me and for enduring me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| Okay, I think that concludes the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Well, I just thought I wanted to jump in on this love fest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| No, just to say that just to echo everything that's been said, I really enjoyed working with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| I feel like I've taken one for the team sitting next to Mr. Dela Voopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| I really got to work on my expression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Apparently I'm on TV when you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| A lot of people told me to look interested and not shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2294)|

| 0:41:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| I will be in favor, but I've got a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| Jim Hagerman's here, and I guess he has Mr. Chris Howley with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| I guess that's who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| You know, we talked real briefly about this last time because we were in the middle of an endless meeting, and it came at the tail end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| But this is a really important ordinance, and I appreciate your statements earlier that you're trying to clarify and simplify the provisions to make it more workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2510)|
| 0:41:59| I'm wondering, did you have any reaction from the developer community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| We're kind of a partnership here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| We're trying to put burdens on them but also work with them to get things done right because we don't want to have stormwater either contaminating our water supplies or anything else, damaging property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2525)|
| 0:42:20| Did you have meetings with them, and how's the reaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| Well, Jim Hagerman, director of engineering, we did not have meetings with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2543)|
| 0:42:32| When we made major changes way back in 1997, we did have a whole series of meetings just to sort of make it clear that the direction was changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2552)|
| 0:42:45| None of the changes in this one really have that big an impact on developers as much as operations for us and clarity, so we did not feel it was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2565)|
| 0:43:00| And they also have this process to tune into if they have some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2580)|
| 0:43:09| And you're working out some of the kinks that have been noticed over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| Yeah, and in a lot of ways we're making life easier for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| Do you have many, I don't know, violation citations or hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| Is that process a heavy flow or is that a fairly light situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| Notices of violation are a tool that we do employ, although we try really hard to work with them to fix the problem rather than just give them a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2609)|
| 0:43:50| So they're sort of a last resort, and penalties associated with them are a last, come even after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2630)|
| 0:44:03| But there's, I mean, yes, we use the tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| It is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| It's an attention-getter, because some of those fines are fairly large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| I guess they come from the Water Act, not the city's own power, so to speak, to impose fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| Well, you might want to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| That might be a Swanson question or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| But, yeah, it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| The fines are based, the civil penalties are based on the city's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| It is based on state law that basically allows us or gives us the authority to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| And it is part of our National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| That's our state permit to operate our stormwater system that requires us to have these measures in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| And so basically our program has to have those components in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| and our program is required to be an effective program is the term that they would use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| and an effective program requires the issuance of notices of violations and civil penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| I assume that if you fail to do that, the state will step in or something and do this, because stormwater is a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| If they find that we are not following the protocols that we have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| we could be subject to enforcement action by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| I just spoke to Mr. Swanson that you're definitely not letting him down in terms of the words that he said about you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| so just wanted to pass that on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2728)|

| 0:47:44| Mr. Hagerman, what exactly will this stop look like in connection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| Is there a rendering of it or a drawing or concept, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| I can get you that, but in general there will be a regular bus stop that faces Summit Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2878)|
| 0:48:10| and there will be a pathway up to the higher level in the apartment to access the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| up higher and it will be ADA compliant and will have lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| Okay, because it's pretty steep right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Yeah, it's pretty steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| So is it going to be kind of ingrained into the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| That's why we have to buy a bunch of property because it has to kind of go a long ways in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| order to chase the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| And is that why it's so high, the acquisition cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| It's high because it's downtown property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Mr. Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Following up on that, I guess this is partly in response to the complaints we had maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| six months ago when some of the bus transportation was cut out to those apartments, but we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| all concerned that those people get good service and I guess by having a stop you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| have a better convenience for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| I mean this whole project is in support of CATS planning and their efforts to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| good service to that part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| What's the projected timeline to finish that project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| One moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| That's not the design bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| No, construction will be completed in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| This allows us to complete purchase of right-of-way, but then it needs to get bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| So construction is 60 days after its bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| So I'm guessing say February, March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| After we go through the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3005)|

| 0:51:23| street lighting assets to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Mr. Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| I guess I see Aaron here and we have Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| I'm just curious about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| The LED program is one that you've presented to us and we've had workshops and that's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| of an exciting development, but this proposal, I guess, is to take over some 29,000 street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| lights from KUB and that includes operation, maintenance, rebuilding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| Is there a cost that we think is ongoing beyond this initial purchase or whatever you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| to call this transfer that we're prepared to meet budget-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| This is Erin Gale, Director of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| This is what I would call the second major piece of that street lighting contract, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| if you recall from the capital budget plan, we've allocated, I believe it's close to $17.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Our Siemens contract that you all approved several months ago is for $9.5 million, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| this is the other significant chunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| All right, but the chunk of the $5.1 million goes to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| What about the ongoing maintenance and replacement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| We have to essentially, in order to benefit at all from the maintenance side of an LED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| project, we have to pay off the stranded cost to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| As we do that, it's our recommendation as a city that we take on ownership in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| to control ongoing maintenance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Because if we're going to pay for an asset in that $5.1 million, we want to then have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| control directly in order to control those costs long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| While it is a significant responsibility that we're taking on, we are fully prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| to manage those costs, both in terms of the lights that we're going to be selecting, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| are warrantied for quite a long time, and looking in the experience of other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| we find that you can absolutely reduce maintenance costs quite significantly through service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| contracts, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| We are prepared to take that maintenance cost on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| While there will be an ongoing operating component and costs associated with it, it'll be far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| less than what we're currently paying KUB in the form of a facilities charge, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| is in the tune of $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| So we're anticipating at least 50% savings on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| You're clearly going to save money over running those old-timey lights with the LEDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| So there's an energy piece and a maintenance piece, and so this allows us to maximize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| maintenance savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| I wonder if I could ask one of our council, either one, what happens when someone runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| their car, truck, whatever, into these poles and gets injured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| Are we going to be in lawsuits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| And how are we dealing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Is just tort immunity law, we pay a limited amount under the statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| Well, we're always going to be in lawsuits, but we're going to defend those under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| Governmental Tort Liability Act, and we're not going to be negligent in putting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| So hopefully we're going to win those lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| We take on traffic signal assets currently, and so it's a similar process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| It's an extension of that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| People run into assets all the time, and we manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| So, again, I don't want to totally discount the responsibility that does come with taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| on these assets, but we have systems in place to deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| And all this is in the capital budget and the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| So it's already covered under the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3286)|

| 0:55:34| Council, we have three individuals who will speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| Do you want to hear them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| I want to make a brief comment to set this up, I think, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| The reason this was taken off the consent memo or approach, yeah, addendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| was that there was some concern expressed by competitors, I guess I'd have to call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| of Total Wine, and the nature of the complaint was such that it was about what they perceived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| as bad conduct elsewhere, whether it's in Wisconsin or Florida or Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3368)|
| 0:56:16| This company has a number of stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| I think that Mr. Seymour pointed out that the most recent ruling was that they did not do anything improper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3379)|
| 0:56:27| and they were entitled to a license in the jurisdiction, I guess, is that Wisconsin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| And so that's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| But the question that was raised was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| is this a big company that kind of shifts profits from one jurisdiction to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3398)|
| 0:56:45| and runs people out of business in an unfair competition sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| And I don't mean to say that I believe that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| We all want competition in businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| But that was the allegation, that these people were, like, misusing their, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| antitrust kind of rights by subsidizing underpricing of goods to hurt the competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| And I think they're here to discuss that and to clarify it, but it's worth talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| Mr. Mayor, or Vice Mayor, members of Council, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| I am here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| I was going to discuss the legal issues involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| I think you've got a packet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| But here with me is Mr. Robert Trone, one of the owners of the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| And if you all would prefer to hear him first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| I think he can address all of the complaints that you are talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Councilman Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Would you prefer to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| It's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| It's your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| It's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Well, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| Here's the process we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| And Mr. Swanson, the city's attorney, and Mr. Frost, your all's attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| can correct me at any time on this if I do not state it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| Retail liquor store licenses are issued by the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3490)|
| 0:58:19| And this is a preliminary step in obtaining that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| City of Knoxville has an ordinance, Article 3, Intoxicating Liquors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| that sets forth certain requirements that a retail liquor store must meet to operate in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3511)|
| 0:58:40| One, you've got to be in a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Two, you've got to be a certain distance from another retail liquor store, parks, churches, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| And these are all set forth in the municipal code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| The applicant has gone through a lengthy process to complete this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| It has been reviewed by your finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| And as I understand from discussing this with the finance department, they meet all the requirements of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3547)|
| 0:59:18| If you all approve this, they then take this to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| and in 60 or 90 days they will have a hearing before the Tennessee ABC, as it's called, T-A-B-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3562)|
| 0:59:33| And they will make further investigation and make further findings and either issue the permit or deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3573)|
| 0:59:43| or tell them they need to correct certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| So the ultimate permit will probably not be issued for 60 to 90 days if there's smooth sailing in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3586)|
| 0:59:56| So the issue is, I submit right here tonight, do they meet you all's ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| And I think they clearly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| This is an issue that comes up with you all the time on renewals, transfers, and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| Tonight you had two items up here, Bob's Package Store on a transfer of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| A lot of nights I've been here you have three or four applications involving retail liquor stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| and are all approved on consent because there has been compliance with the city ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| and vetting by the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| Now, what disturbed me was you all received a packet of materials from a lawyer in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3635)|
| 1:00:49| who set out some outrageous allegations, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| One, there was a hearing up in Minnesota, Bloomington, Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| He set out the opponent's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| without submitting to you what the administrative law judge found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| which I sent a letter to you all today, and the administrative law judge says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| they have shown by preponderance, the opponents have not shown by preponderance of the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| that the applicant is not of good moral character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| That the applicant's application have not shown by preponderance of the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| that the applicant is not of good moral character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| And the administrative law judge issued or told the city council to issue the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3698)|
| 1:01:47| Mr. Seymour, you have less than a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| If I had submitted that to a tribunal, Chantry Circuit Court, and omitted that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3710)|
| 1:01:58| I would have been contemptuous of that court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| There was other information that was submitted that was incomplete, did not give you follow-up, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3723)|
| 1:02:11| So for those issues, and I'm about to sit down because my time is running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| I'm going to turn this over to either Mr. Trone, who will address these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| and tell you about their business, and Mr. Schaefer, the general counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| Robert or David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Robert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Robert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Definitely Robert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| I'd like to spend just a few seconds giving us a little background of the business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| and what we do and what we like to do in the fine city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Oh, name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Robert Trone, 9829 Avenel Farm Drive, Potomac, Maryland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| My brother and I grew up on a farm in south-central Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| After the farm, I went to college, then went to law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| After law school, my brother and myself opened up our first wine and liquor store in the state of Delaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| It was approximately a 1,500-foot store, a very small store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| I worked every day in the store, gradually was able to expand that store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| and purchase a second store in the state of Delaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| My brother and myself have been very successful in helping the consumers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| providing great selection and service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| and we gradually continued to build our family business over the last 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| Today, we're very fortunate to have 173 stores located across 21 states in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| being the largest family-owned wine and liquor chain in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| We have done this really by serving the consumer, giving the consumer great selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| great customer service every day, clean, well-lit stores, desirable shopping environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| having great staff on our staff, helping customers with their purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| providing them the information they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| having a very friendly business environment for consumers to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| So I think it's really selection, service, and certainly offering fair prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| Each of our stores have a large educational room to help educate the consumers on wine and spirits and beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| also have a tasting area to provide tastings in states where it's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| So really our focus is how do we provide great customer service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| I will admit that sometimes that does create competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| but from our viewpoint, we should let the consumers decide where they want to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| If my brother and myself can offer a better shopping environment and consumers choose our stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| that's good for the consumers, no different than recently, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| consumers being able to shop in grocery stores for wine, that's bad for some stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| but it's good for the consumer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Two is I think one of our key focuses has always been prevention of sales to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| That is our key focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| How do we abide by the law in all 21 states that we're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| Certainly from my legal background, that's our number one focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| At the end of the day, we have to abide by every local law, and that is critical and key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| Yes, we do make some mistakes over the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Over the last seven years, we've had five sales to failed five stings across 171 stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| While five sounds like a lot, but if you think about 171 stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| basically that means we had 166 stores, perfect record over the last seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| and five that made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Five mistakes is too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| We're certainly focused on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| We have a program in our stores to provide our cashiers a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| We basically pay the cashiers a bonus for carting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| We pay them even a higher bonus for turning someone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| Our key number one goal every day in the morning huddles is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| how do we prevent any possible sale to a minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| That's fundamentally the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Second thing we like to work on in each community is how do we give back to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| And each year, last year we gave back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| We dealt with 4,200 different nonprofits located throughout the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| giving to those nonprofits in both goods and in cash approximately $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| So, again, really how do we fit in with the community and really give back to that community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| As we look here in Nashville, that's really our key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| And I think that's what we're here to do is serve the consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| I know, you know, I read some of the material that was sent to the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| newspaper articles, allegations, things that never came to fruition, such as in Minnesota,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| where the findings of fact were sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| The license in Minnesota was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Today we have eight licenses operating in Minnesota, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| And if you went through the other allegations and every one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| we've never been turned down for a license, you know, and continue to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| So I look forward to working in Knoxville with everyone here, supporting the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| and really providing the consumers what they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Happy to take any questions if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| Before you leave, what do you say in response to that predatory pricing allegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| that somehow the parent company, the holding company, kind of subsidizes undercutting fair pricing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4029)|
| 1:07:17| And I don't know that it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| I'm just saying, how do you respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Because that was the thing that frightened me a little bit was, is that true or not true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| or how do we deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Yes, we went back, and this allegation comes up times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| In a day, we're a family company, so there is no parent company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| There's my brother and myself, so just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| RSSI or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| RSSI, so the company that we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| The key is, is that, you know, in some markets, some competitors' sales are affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| but if we went back and looked at the number of competitors that are very close to our stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| no one goes out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Everyone stays in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Our stores are destination stores drawing from a wide area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| The local packet store is serving an individual small community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| Our stores bring from a much wider area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| And so I think it's just never has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| And, you know, so I think that because we're destination stores, we're not a local neighborhood store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| Yes, I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| You have a pretty major operation across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Approximately, just ballpark, how many employees would you employ here if you opened a store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| Okay, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| We will have approximately 50 to 60 employees, of which 75 percent will be full-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| and those will offer full benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| What type of pay range are you paying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| Our pay range is raised depending on whether they're salary or hourly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| but it ranges usually somewhere between, depending on the market, between $11 and $17 an hour to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Yeah, my question is to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| So there's been, I guess, bring us up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| So there's been a state law on the books for quite a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| that you had to be a resident of the state of Tennessee to own a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| That's been challenged in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| There's been an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| And give us the process of that and how that pending appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| and where that is and how that might affect this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Well, there is a residency requirement, as you are aware, that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| It was challenged in court, and the federal district court found that the residency requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| was in violation of the Commerce Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Our state attorney general has also given an opinion that it violates the Commerce Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| The residency requirement does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| And so that makes it, from our perspective, an unenforceable requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| unless and until some court of competent jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| be that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals or some other court of competent jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| determines that the residency requirement does not, in fact, violate the Commerce Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| That has not happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| And until it does, we do not believe that either this council or the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| is in a position to enforce the residency requirement that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| So is it on appeal now? Is that where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| I've heard it, but I haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| You haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| I received a communication from someone that said it was on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| but the city's is not because it's not in our caseload of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| Is that our jurisdiction to say this is what we think state law is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| or is that up to the TABC once this goes to Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| I think that's really up to TABC when it gets to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| Unless it's our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| If it's our case, obviously we defend it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| But we defended our case and lost our case long before I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| and so we have not enforced the residency requirement since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| We have not enforced the residency requirement for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| For years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| For years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Is this the first Total Wine store in Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| Mr. Schaffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| You'll state your name and address, and you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Robert Schaffer, 6600 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, Maryland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| Mr. Vice Mayor, members of the city council, thank you for hearing from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| I really have two objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| The first, of course, is that I would like to answer any questions you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| about the materials that you've read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| I have personal knowledge about most of the matters involved in the submissions that you've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4306)|
| 1:11:54| I am the chief legal officer for the company called RSSI, or Retail Services and Systems, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| That is a company that owns the intellectual property and the trade name Total Wine and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| There are independent, separate legal entities that operate all these 173 stores that you've heard about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| and so they're completely separate companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| There is common ownership between those entities and the RSSI entity, but they are separate companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4337)|
| 1:12:27| I guess I want to start off by saying, as the chief legal officer for the company that gives advice to the operating entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4347)|
| 1:12:36| such as the applicant that is asking the city council for a license approval tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| that we are law-abiding and zealous licensees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| We do not violate the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| I think if you ask any of the regulators in the 21 states in which we operate what they think about our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| what they think about the entities that have been approved by 21 different states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| through a vigorous process similar to what goes on in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| and 142 separate cities that have vetted this applicant or applicants that are similar to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4387)|
| 1:13:15| and have said that they are qualified, they will tell you that we are a top-notch business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| that we are law-abiding citizens, that we operate a good business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| and that we bring value both to the cities that we operate in and the consumers that we service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| I wanted to address a couple comments that were made about this predatory pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| Our company is a company that operates its licensees operate in a highly regulated environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4419)|
| 1:13:47| Over the last 10 or 15 years, I've been a lawyer for 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| there has been a lot of precedent that was established by the Supreme Court of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| and other courts about the antitrust laws and how they intersect with the regulation of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| We have never been found by any court and have never been found by any of our licensing entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4443)|
| 1:14:11| to have engaged in any predatory pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| We don't engage in predatory pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| There are two instances in two states, Massachusetts and the state of Connecticut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| where they have very esoteric, archaic laws about pricing of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| The way alcohol is priced is the retailer buys its alcohol from a wholesaler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| who gets its alcohol from a supplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| Somebody makes the alcohol, a distributor in the middle tier buys it from the supplier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| the wholesaler then sells it to the retailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| In two states, Massachusetts and the state of Connecticut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| they have laws that prohibit retailers from selling either below the cost they paid for the alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| from the wholesaler or below prices that are set for those products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| by the wholesalers that distribute the products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| That's Connecticut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| In both of those states, there's been a lot of law regarding whether that's permissible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| In Massachusetts, the law is you can't sell below your actual cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| As a volume buyer, as a big business, we buy a lot of alcohol for all of our stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| In Massachusetts, we have eight different stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| We buy the alcohol at volume, and we get better prices as a result of buying more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4525)|
| 1:15:33| That's the way it works in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| If you buy more of a product, you'll get a slightly better price or a discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| In Massachusetts, the law is that you can't sell below your cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| When we buy something for $10, and the wholesaler says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| if you buy 100 cases of that, we'll sell it to you for $8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| Our cost is $8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| We can price that product, if we so choose, at $8 or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| and pass the savings that we derive from our business model on to consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| That's good for consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| It's good for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| And so that's Massachusetts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Now, in Massachusetts, we had a court that determined that we were correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| that our interpretation of how to derive or ascertain the cost of the product was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| That was a court in Massachusetts, and they found in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| In Connecticut, we are asking the court to clarify whether the laws in Connecticut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4589)|
| 1:16:36| allow us to price our products so that we can pass savings on to consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| We haven't been accused of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| We're asking the courts to clarify what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Your time is up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| The court in Connecticut has – that still matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| It's still in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4618)|
| 1:17:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| No questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Those that oppose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| 12A is an ordinance to amend the newly created Chapter 16, Article 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| Section 2, Section 2.2 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| to require notification of the application of a short-term rental operating permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| Council, we have several people who have signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| and I would also like to ask Council for a motion to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| so that I can participate in the debate concerning this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| Dwayne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Dwayne, can I ask one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| I just want to say I wanted to thank, I guess it was Krista or the legal department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| for clarifying what they meant by adjacent properties so that there's no mystery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| Since we're putting the burden on the individual applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| he needs to know who he's going to notify or she needs to know who she's going to notify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| and that's at the bottom of that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| So that is a help, and I thank them for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| We have signed up Amy Midas, Mary English, and Don Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| Speaking in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4705)|
| 1:18:39| State your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Amy Midas, 5015 West Summit Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| Thank you, Vice Mayor Grieve, for adding this emergency amendment to today's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| and thank you, council members, for its reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| I am the president of the Forest Heights Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| and our board supports this amendment to the short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| Since being elected five years ago as our president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| a number of conflicts have arisen between neighbors and Forest Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| Whether it's barking dogs, unkept yards, or street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| like many other neighborhood leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| I get an e-mail or a phone call from neighbors wanting my involvement in resolving their issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| The first question I ask is, have you spoken to your neighbor about the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| In every instance during the past five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| the neighbor has always responded that they have had very little or no contact with the other neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| I know that there is conflict between friendly neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| but they are able to resolve it due to the relationship that previously exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| and an open line of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| There have been three STRs in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| The operators did not tell their adjacent neighbors about their STRs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| but they quickly figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| By not communicating this fact, it strained the relationship between the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| A level of distrust and secrecy was created between these parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| The current ordinance allows for an online database to verify the locations of STRs within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4813)|
| 1:20:20| However, the letters proposed in this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| and sent by STR operators to their adjacent neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| show a sign of goodwill between neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| and offer the opportunity for dialogue between both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| Communication is the key to a successful relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| This is especially the case in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| We host neighborhood events almost every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| What is its purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Of course, we enjoy the fellowship and sense of community that the events promote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| but it allows for continued neighbor engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I know creating these bonds within neighborhoods are important to you and the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| We have all heard the mayor say great cities are built on great neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| Neighborhood organizations are the voice of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| and I'm here today to say that we need this amendment as part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| The short-term rental ordinance has the potential to create conflict between neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| While many groups, including ours, do not support its passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| we are ready to help ease the change occurring in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| Please help us help you by adding this amendment to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| Mary English, you'll state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| Two weeks ago I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| I addressed to the city council about the notification amendment at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| and I was doing so on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| And at the time I said that a basic league principle is a citizen's right to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| about government actions that are likely to affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| The league's position hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| It supports the notification ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| Tonight, though, I am mainly speaking as the new president of the Bearden Village Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4941)|
| 1:22:29| which was formerly called the Bearden Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| and I will say that I am very much a newbie to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| and I can't possibly fill Terry's big shoes, but I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| So, as you probably know, members of the Bearden Village Council include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| both representatives of neighborhood associations, such as Amy, and also businesses in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| Yesterday I did an e-mail poll of the members asking whether I should speak on behalf of the Bearden Village Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4975)|
| 1:23:05| and whether or not I should speak in support of the proposed notification ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| The response was a unanimous yes, you should speak in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=4993)|
| 1:23:20| This included, notably, a yes from a member who has strongly voiced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| that she likes having short-term rentals in her neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| She said that notification seems like a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| The short-term rental ordinance has divided Knoxville, and I find that very painful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5018)|
| 1:23:47| but surely the notification ordinance provision is something that we all could agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5027)|
| 1:23:55| regardless of our other differences about this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| So, thank you, and I appreciate your patience for listening to me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| Did Mr. Parnell make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| I don't believe he's here. I haven't seen him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Council, we're open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| Mr. Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Mr. Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| We have voted on this twice before, and I have supported this both times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| and I intend to do the same this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| It's somewhat uncomfortable because, quite frankly, I agree with what both the speakers just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| that I think it's the neighborly thing to notify your neighbors of whatever might affect them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| regardless of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| This codifies that, and I have some discomfort with that, but I think on balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| this is probably the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| So, I hope that my colleagues will support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| Mr. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Thank you. Thank you, Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| Well, sorry I wasn't here last time to vote for it, and maybe we wouldn't be back reading it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| I think, you know, this is a fair and reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| It is only for Type 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| It only requires notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| It doesn't require anybody to sign anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| It doesn't require anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| You can put something in the mail or in their mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| I would agree with Amy Midas that many times conflicts can be resolved if we'll just sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| and they know who to contact, if they've met them, or at least have some piece of paper, you know, notifying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| I think that would begin the extension of the arm to have communication about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| I don't have any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| It's a one-time deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| It doesn't go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| If an ownership changes across the street, you don't have to re-notify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| This is a one-time notification that I'm going to put in my house and use it for an STR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| So, I think it's very reasonable, and I've supported it before and intend to support it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| Mr. Stare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| I've kind of gone back and forth on this when I was against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| because I sort of had concerns that it would just sort of create complaints maybe when they weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| But I do see that it has some positives, as were mentioned tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| So, I'll be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| One thing that I really think is key to this whole proposal is the owner-occupied requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5192)|
| 1:26:40| I think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| And so, I think this one thing that sort of got me comfortable with this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| is I think that it will help enforce that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| So, I'll be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| Ms. Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| I have not previously supported this, and I won't be supporting it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Some persuasive arguments have been made about being neighborly and knowing what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| But there are many neighborhoods where short-term rentals will be located or are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5227)|
| 1:27:14| where there is no neighborhood organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| And so, that part of it bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| If you notify your neighbor, good, then that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| There's nothing that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| So, it just seems to me like this is an exercise in unneeded action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5247)|
| 1:27:35| on the part of people who operate short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| In my neighborhood, if I have somebody who is, for example, an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| and he works at home and meets his clients someplace else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| he didn't notify me that he was doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| If I have a neighbor who's a lawyer and he works at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| maybe he goes into an office or he works in the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| he doesn't notify the neighbors that he's doing that at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| So, I think that this is maybe opening up a can of government interference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| that we don't need to go down that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5289)|
| 1:28:15| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| I think council knows where I stand on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| This is the third time that we've brought this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| and I'm hoping that it will pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| To Ms. Palmer's concern about neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| the way this has been crafted is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| if there's an existing neighborhood organization within the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| that one would be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| I do think that some good points were made this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| I think both Ms. English and Ms. Midas made some good points in terms of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| This is an issue that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| last time we dealt with an issue that had to do with a historic overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| that the concern was how divisive that particular issue was in one neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| And we've been dealing with short-term rentals now for a number of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| and it's obvious that this has been a divisive issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| that has occurred in a lot of neighborhoods throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| And one of the things that I'd asked for the last time is some consistency in what this council does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| as well as the administration, in terms of looking at what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| And I think this is an absolute easy compromise for the short-term rental folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5361)|
| 1:29:29| It's also good for the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| and I think that the neighborhoods have gotten to the point where they've accepted the fact that there will be short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| but the least that they can expect is to have those people who are going to have those short-term rentals at least notify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| It's just like Mr. Wallace said, it's a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| It's their responsibility, and I think that that's the least that we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| is to ask those individuals to notify their neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| and continue a neighborly kind of relationship within an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| So we're going to call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| Yeah, we need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| Okay, we have a motion. Do we have a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| We have a motion and a second. All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| Do you want to do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| Let's do a roll call just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| Councilman Brown? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| Councilman Campin? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Councilman De La Volpe? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Vice Mayor Grieve? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Councilwoman Palmer? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| Councilman Pavlis is absent. Councilman Saunders? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| Councilman Starr? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Councilman Wallace? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| Thank you. The vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Six to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| I would now ask that we consider this on an emergency vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| so that this council can take care of the short-term rentals and put it to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| All right. All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| Well, they already adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| We need to vote on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| One more time. We're going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| What are we voting in? As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Well, we jumped ahead, so we're going to vote on it as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| Motion is made to approve on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| Okay. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| We're doing this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| We have a motion and a second. All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| Thank you, Council. I appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| 12B is an ordinance to close an unnamed alley from West Emerald Avenue to West Oldham Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| subject to one condition authorizing the mayor to execute quit-claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| North Knoxville Baptist Church, Applicant Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| Motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| It's been moved and seconded. All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| Vice Mayor? Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| That's fine. I just had a question for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| This one was a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| Can you explain what the private easement is and how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5532)|
| 1:32:19| I guess my first question is, is this different than a normal alley closure and how does this one work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| The action that the Planning Commission took on this particular matter is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| Excuse me, Dan Kelly, MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| The action that the MPC took on this matter is somewhat different than others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| in that they asked for the retention of a public easement across their property in order to try to maintain connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5557)|
| 1:32:47| This is an alley that serves as a byway for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| The church is asking that the alley be closed so that they can put an awning on a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5575)|
| 1:33:03| and if they do so, it would encroach partially into the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| By allowing the alley to be closed, then they don't have the issue of the encroachment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| and the public still will have some access across their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| So they are still required to keep up the alley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| That's the way it becomes private property, and therefore they would be responsible for maintaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5603)|
| 1:33:32| Council has the option, if you choose to do so, to approve it with or without the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| No, I like the condition, and so I guess any member of the public has the right to enforce that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5618)|
| 1:33:45| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| Okay, it's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| 12C is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of Moss Grove Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| from PC1 District to C6 District, subject to one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| Tim Dwyer, Leaseman Engineering Applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5652)|

| 1:34:14| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5654)|

| 1:34:18| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| Council, we have one person to speak for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| Mr. Seaman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| Ms. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5666)|

| 1:34:29| Ms. Terry Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Oh, Terry Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| That's a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| I'm here tonight as a resident of the 2nd District and a longtime member of the Bearden Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| which is now the Bearden Village Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| I want to thank all of you who will be leaving City Council this month for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| and to wish you well in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| I especially want to thank Vice Mayor Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| who has attended almost every single meeting of our council in the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5705)|
| 1:35:11| Vice Mayor Brown has been the council rep for one of our neighborhoods represented in our council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5711)|
| 1:35:18| Historic Southern Heights, and we have been so glad to have you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5718)|
| 1:35:25| Dwayne has been a member of this umbrella group of five neighborhoods for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| before he ran for office, I think since 2002, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| He was the point person monitoring unsightly signage in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| when Barbara Pelow was our council rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| Dwayne has done so many things that have benefited our entire community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| but residents of the Bearden area are especially grateful for his efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| to bring to fruition the recommendations in our Bearden Village Small Area Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| We have almost completed our infrastructure and efforts to improve public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| We have added a community park during his tenure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| and have in place a zone that will allow higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| and enable more people to enjoy the great quality of life in this environmentally sustainable village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5770)|
| 1:36:18| We are grateful to you and hope that you will perhaps choose to continue at our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5778)|
| 1:36:26| and that maybe you'll choose to accept a different political office in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| While I'm here, I'm going to take advantage of this and thank David Brace and Jim Hagerman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| and Bill Lyons and Jesse Mayshark and all the people that we've irritated during the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5798)|
| 1:36:49| That includes you, Rob, and Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| Thank you, and thank you, Dwayne. We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171205?start=5814)|
