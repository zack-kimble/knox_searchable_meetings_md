| 0:01:19| A couple of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| As Superintendent Risewick announced at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| high school graduation ceremonies will take place between Thursday, May 18th and Friday, June 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| Also, the last day of school for students will be half a day on Wednesday, May 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| and the last day for teachers is Thursday, May 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| On behalf of the Board, I want to wish all of our students, families and staff a wonderful and restful summer break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| and also all of our teachers a happy Teacher Appreciation Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| You're almost there, but we do appreciate all of you and your hard work as well as all of our support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=113)|
| 0:02:03| Board members, you received an email from Ms. Coatney last night regarding Item 10D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| and the contract with King Construction for renovations at Lincoln Park Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| The contract amount was listed correctly on the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| but the amount stated in the agenda caption and on the fiscal note was not correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| and have been taken from an earlier contract draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| Both of those have been updated to reflect the correct amount of $4,478,590.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=145)|
| 0:02:33| As far as changes to the agenda, no one requested it on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| but I do feel that we need to remove Item 10 from the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| so I'm removing that from the consent agenda and just placing it at the top of the regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=165)|
| 0:02:54| Are there any other requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| So a motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| Superintendent Roswick, I think we have some special recognition starting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you, Madam Chair. We do, and I'm actually going to let Dr. Wilson prepare for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| to recognize the Valedictorian Salutatorians from all of our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| Guys, welcome. Good to be glad you're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board, and Superintendent Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| It's my great pleasure to join with you as we recognize some very special students tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Board policy I-330 states that the Valedictorian and Salutatorian at each of our high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| shall earn the highest and next highest grade point averages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| but these young men and women are much more than these high grade point averages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| that they have carried through their high school careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| They are leaders in our schools and communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| and they give us all confidence that we're in great hands for a very promising future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| I'm proud and honored to serve them and to introduce them to you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| So students, handsome group, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| I will introduce you in alphabetic order by your school first and then your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| When I read your name, please come forward and stand in front of the board table area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Ms. Coatney has got something she's going to be handing to each of you as you come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Once we have the whole group, we're going to take some photos with the board and the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| Also, if I could ask everyone in the audience to please hold your applause until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| We will celebrate all of our amazing students after I finish reading the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| There are a few students who could not join us tonight, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Are we still there? A couple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| Because of our scheduling conflicts, but we are going to read all names aloud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| and we'll get their certificate to them at their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| All right. So without further ado, we're going to begin with Austin East Magnet High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=285)|

| 0:05:34| I'm going to take a moment here to offer a special note that if there is a tie through the 100th of a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| for either the valedictorian or the salutatorian, then all students qualifying for that award will be named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=340)|

| 0:17:48| Forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| I have a waiver from New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| Can we bring – are we going to bring them up first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Can we bring Officer Tyler Bowles and then Nurse Rebecca Rice, UT Student Nurse Bailey Bentley, and UT Student Nurse Rebecca Doris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1079)|
| 0:18:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| On Tuesday, 18 April, 2023, about 12, 15 hours, Officer Tyler Bowles, while on duty at Bearden High School, was called via radio to respond to a medical emergency in one of the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1101)|
| 0:18:33| Upon arrival, Officer Bowles was made aware of an unresponsive staff member in cardiac arrest needing the AED machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1113)|
| 0:18:42| Officer Bowles ran down the hall to locate and bring back the AED machine, while the BHS school nurse, Rebecca Rice, and the two UT Student Nurses, Bailey Bentley and Rebecca Doris, moved the staff members to a safe location on the floor to check for a pulse and prepare for CPR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1122)|
| 0:18:59| Officer Bowles then began chest compressions while Nurse Rice set up the AED machine and placed the pads on the staff member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| After Nurse Rice deployed the device, Officer Bowles provided life-saving chest compressions, approximately 80, and then each of the student nurses took turns with compressions before Bowles continued with another 80 to 100 compressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1146)|
| 0:19:20| Officer Bowles was needed to do these compressions as long as possible due to Bowles' strength – this is where you're supposed to pose – and stature of the staff member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1160)|
| 0:19:31| Officer Bowles and the two student nurses continued chest compressions for more than five minutes until KFD and AMR arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| Thanks to the quick response and the continued actions of Officer Bowles and the medical staff at Bearden High School that day, the staff member received the medical attention needed to restart his heart and keep him alive while AMR responded to take him to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1179)|
| 0:19:54| Congratulations to all four. We're going to be giving the Chief's Lifesaver Award to all four of you, and if you'll indulge me for a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1194)|

| 0:21:49| All right. This is a little easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1309)|

| 0:22:17| So, board members, we are going to take a five-minute recess because I know some of our guests probably aren't wanting to stay for the meeting, and we have some people in overflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1337)|
| 0:22:27| So we're going to take a five-minute recess just to kind of give them an opportunity, and if some seats free up, others an opportunity to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1347)|
| 0:22:47| All right. So with that, we are back from recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Before we get into our regular agenda, I just want to remind everyone in attendance tonight, I know sometimes issues come up that people are really passionate about, and we're glad that you chose to attend this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1371)|
| 0:23:07| But please, please, please note that elevated noise makes it very difficult for us to hear each other as well as for you and people at home to hear what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1387)|
| 0:23:18| So we ask that you refrain from interruptions, clapping, booing, cheering, all that snapping, whatever, and just be mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1398)|
| 0:23:31| We certainly do not want to ask anyone to leave tonight, but we do have a lot to get through tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| So just be mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| We can't just have constant interruptions, so we will have to ask you to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| Also, if you want to have a discussion with someone sitting beside you, please step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| All right. And with that, we will go into our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| Item 7, Consent Agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1438)|

| 0:31:42| Item 10, Approved Memorandum of Understanding with East Tennessee Freedom Schools for Provision of Summer Programming for KCS Students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1902)|
| 0:31:50| for a term of one year which may be extended for four additional years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| A motion by Rev. Butler and a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| And before we get into discussion in public forum, board members, I'd like to have board discussion first on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| because I've been talking with Mr. Dupler and the superintendent and Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| We've had several conversations about this week because there's been some things that have changed kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| or been brought to light as far as some of the legal questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| First of all, I want to be very clear for the public because I think there's some misconceptions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| We are not voting on whether freedom schools can exist or operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| That's not what this is about. They've been operating for years in our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| We have 8,000 facility requests a year, I believe, Dr. Adams, you said we processed yearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| And a lot of outside organizations do summer programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| And so this is not a vote on whether the merits of the program or whether the program exists or doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1974)|
| 0:33:03| I mean, I think that it's well established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| And so what's before the board, it's before the board for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| One is an MOU for data sharing, which parents opt into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| We don't just randomly share data with other organizations. Parents have to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| And in this case, like many other ones, from talking to Miss Dean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| it sounds like they can evaluate the merits of their program because it's very it's a literacy focused program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2009)|
| 0:33:38| And the other reason is for transportation, because we did have buses in these neighborhoods going to these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2018)|
| 0:33:48| And after several conversations with Mr. Dupler and Superintendent Reiswick and Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| Wilson, and there seems to be some concerns about the transportation piece in regards to curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2035)|
| 0:34:05| And if that binds us to have to monitor their curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| And it's sounding like there that is the case after talking to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| And to be honest, we do not have the resources or the structure to monitor outside organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| Curriculum is my understanding or the legal expertise. I don't know unless Mr. Dupler has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2065)|
| 0:34:34| So what what would be the consequences of that if, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| someone deemed the curriculum didn't follow under state guidelines, would that would basically compromise state funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| So so there is an issue with transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| And the other the other thing with transportation that's been kind of brought to light is other organizations that we partner with are now saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2092)|
| 0:35:02| well, maybe maybe we can look into this for us. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| And we do not know what buses are going to have seats and what buses aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| And then are you going to get in a situation where it looks like you are doing something for one that you might not have seats for the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2111)|
| 0:35:19| And so for all of these reasons, and I am supportive of this MOU, but in Mr. Dupler, maybe you can weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2119)|
| 0:35:29| I just feel legally that it it might be in the district's best interest to pull the transportation piece out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2129)|
| 0:35:39| Can you speak a little bit to that? Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| First of all, I would I would like to say that I think the board missed an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| I know the city council, Kyle, Texas, dressed up in Star Wars costumes for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| So I don't know. I don't know who's supposed to organize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| That's the vice chair's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| So but beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| So I'll just give a little bit of history about this, or at least what I know, which is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2165)|
| 0:36:14| This MOU came came to our office just like hundreds and hundreds of contracts come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| Hey, take a look at this for the form and then, you know, is it in legal form or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| So at face value, it was in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| But after Monday's discussion, we were you know, I was asked to take a closer look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| I know state legislators had reached out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I know that there were conversations with other state officials about, you know, concerns about a particular statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2201)|
| 0:36:50| And that statute is just I want to make sure I get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| Forty nine dash six dash ten, nineteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| And the some of the legislators, you know, mentioned that, hey, we feel like this this could be a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| And legally, what I can I can say a few things about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| One is this is a fairly new statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| I searched for cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| And I think Mr. Watson and I talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| I searched for precedent either from appeals courts or the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| And there are no precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| So there's no there's no court decisions on this particular statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| Again, it's fairly new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| So we don't have that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| But but at least there is the concern out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| And I can also tell you this, that that this statute applies to, you know, the county board of education and any other board of education, you know, in in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2262)|
| 0:37:56| So if if funds are being used from the LEA, which is this board, then then the only one that stands to to lose anything is the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2276)|
| 0:38:12| So with those concerns, you know, you would ask me to create a an alternative data sharing agreement, which which the board has, you know, several data sharing type of of arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2292)|
| 0:38:29| You know, they differ slightly from from entity to entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| But but that would not use any funds and would simply be a non-compensated agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| So that's that's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2321)|
| 0:38:49| Mr. Dipler, could you clarify the length of time the buses would be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| Well, that might be something that that that's to pretend it rides with might be better to answer again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| I've been learning more about the inner workings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| Again, I just looked at this agreement for the form initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| But since Monday, a lot of the substantive questions have been have been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| Well, I'll pass that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| So I think the same kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| Let me let me say this on behalf of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| I really think, again, with Miss Dean and with our staff, everything was was well intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| I think, you know, 10 months ago, we made a call to the community to say we can't be everything for everybody who can come in, who will come around and help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| I think, you know, Freedom Schools has been a six year partner working with students who go to Knox County schools and has been very successful in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2382)|
| 0:39:53| And I think the way those conversations happened with staff members were just in conversation with Miss Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| To my knowledge, Miss Dean didn't ask for the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| As we've looked into some of those, it was just a conversation that struck that began talking about ways to, again, work with community partners and to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2401)|
| 0:40:10| I do think the staff members who had that conversation had no intention to try to push anything outside of just trying to help an organization have access to more kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2410)|
| 0:40:20| I think even when that came before the board, even into Monday, that's still where we were, that this might be something that we could try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2420)|
| 0:40:27| It was not a practice we'd had, but we always like to try different things to try to give kids more opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| I do think, again, in talking with Mr. Duplan, kind of looking through those things, the law that was passed that has certain content that can and can't be taught, and that's in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2433)|
| 0:40:44| we still view that as summer programming. It's not something that we, we don't police anyone's summer programming and the content that's in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2444)|
| 0:40:52| But as he has expressed, talking to different people, if we are providing resource for, which could be seen as promoting any of those, we now fall under, as a school system, those same laws and rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2452)|
| 0:41:08| Again, that was not the staff's intent at all when that happened. I think they were just trying to try something out to try to give access to students for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| So, with that new information, I do think it puts a situation where, as a staff, I've talked with Dr. Wilson, and he may want to jump into that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2475)|
| 0:41:24| We have supervisors in things like social studies and English. They are trained in pedagogy, which is how to teach and how to be better and more effective teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2484)|
| 0:41:36| They are not legal experts in interpreting how law applies to curriculum. The way our curriculum works is the state does this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2496)|
| 0:41:45| They pick the text based on the law. They give us a list then for a committee to choose off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| So, we've never had to address the issue of what is prohibited content and not, and we're not prepared as a staff to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| It would take some legal counsel on our side to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| So, I think those are things that have happened since Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Our clarity that could be seen as promotion by the district to provide transportation and then our inability to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| We're not positioned to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| So, I think those are new things that have come to light as we have a better understanding of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| But, I want to say again, Ms. Dean never asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| I think our staff was just trying to find a way to give students opportunities on a program that has meant a lot to a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2542)|
| 0:42:31| Can I ask my question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| I'm going to ask it in two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| How long is our summer program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| That's a good question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| This is where I was going with that, Ms. Elmer. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| So, I got lost in my own thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| So, that was another thing as we looked into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| So, our summer program for our summer camp is four weeks long and theirs is six weeks long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| So, that was something as we looked into MOU as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| The thought was originally there would be kind of that time to be able to piggyback, if you would, for those four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| But, there are two extra weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| And, again, no fault to Freedom Schools for having that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| I think the way the MOU is written, it talks about the duration of their program, duration of our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| There was no talk about the two weeks in between that theirs is longer than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| And, I think that's something as we look closer at the MOU that's there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| I think as a board member, my understanding was that it was the same length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| And, I think that's sort of what was presented on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| And, I mean, through no fault of theirs at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| So, knowing that it's a different timeline and knowing that our buses are contracted by Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2620)|
| 0:43:54| they could still contract with our same bus contractors, not at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| but they could contract a bus also and still have transportation to our schools, just not on the same buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2640)|
| 0:44:08| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| Yeah. So, I think I'm going to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| So, tell me if I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| So, we do have, and Dr. Adams may be able to speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| we do have other community partners who do actually contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| And, I'm not 100% sure, so I'm going to have to go to Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| I don't know if they contract that through us with payment or they contract straight to the contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| But, I'll have you speak to that if you don't mind, please, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Certainly. Thank you, Dr. Ryslick, Madam Chair, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| So, basically, our other contractors, they partner with KEF, and so they reimburse Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| So, to answer your question, I believe what you're asking is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| can Freedom Schools reach out directly to our contractors to contract transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| The answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| And, when local agencies ask us to connect them with contractors, we certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| So, understanding that because of the promoting of the buses, that Knox County Schools would be promoting the Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2703)|
| 0:45:23| So, then, Knox County Schools would be responsible for making sure that the Freedom Schools curriculum met the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2723)|
| 0:45:33| That is my understanding from talking to Mr. Dupour. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| The way the MOU is worded, Reverend Butler, I mean, it's more of a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| It's school funds used for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| And, then, that's going to require that Knox County Schools and this board have more oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| And, then, that's why the legislators and the state officials are speaking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2760)|
| 0:46:09| So, the legislators put pressure on us to look at it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2769)|
| 0:46:19| Or, why were the legislators involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| I mean, why did the legislators get involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| I'm sorry, Reverend Butler. Please, please, we do not want to ask you to leave, but we have to get through this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| It was my understanding, well, just to be honest, probably because a mass email went out telling everyone that we are partnering with CDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2794)|
| 0:46:48| Say that one more time. I didn't hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| So, probably, to answer your question, I'm just assuming they're involved because a mass email went out telling people in the community that we are partnering with this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2811)|
| 0:47:00| And, they reached out to their state legislators and they gave feedback is what I am assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| However, I can tell you the ones that I heard from did cite the law that Gary cited as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| So, what is the state law's directive on how Knox County Schools is supposed to make sure this happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2834)|
| 0:47:30| What does the law say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| It's a fairly lengthy statute, but I'll read the starting paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2853)|
| 0:47:44| It says, and again this is 49.6.10.19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| An LEA, which is a board or public charter school, shall not include or promote the following concepts as part of a course of instruction or in a curriculum or instructional program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2869)|
| 0:48:00| or allow teachers or other employees of the LEA or public charter school to use supplemental instructional materials that include or promote the following concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2880)|
| 0:48:10| And then it lists 14 concepts and then it lists some exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| Okay, but does it list how Knox County Schools, since they're the LEA, how we would have to make sure of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2897)|
| 0:48:29| I think that's part of the problem that Ms. Christie and Dr. Ryswick are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| I mean, is that this law is not real specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| I mean, it's fairly general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| There's not been, again, case law on this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| So, you know, our office might have to spend a long time researching this along with administration to try and come up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2928)|
| 0:48:58| We may have to reach out to other professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| So I think the concern is that KCS at this point is not prepared to try to police this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2941)|
| 0:49:09| So now, and I can have Ms. Dean come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| She sent me the list or she sent me that information you just read from and the 14 items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| She's looked through her list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| I think even on Monday night, Ms. Horn mentioned one of the books that wasn't against the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| So, you know, it doesn't sound like it's hard to determine if that is in fact true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| But one of the things I'm seeing here is we had some, and I'm going to use the word conflict, about whether or not we should have this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2978)|
| 0:49:50| And now we have a law that says that they can't get the needed transportation, one of those areas that we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2990)|
| 0:49:58| And now there's a law that says that we can't do it and we don't have the means to meet the requirements of the law when the law don't say what the requirements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=2998)|
| 0:50:08| And also that there's no indication that this organization is not already meeting the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3008)|
| 0:50:16| It's an assumption that they may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Then I think about that there was also a law that said during the child of schools discussion that there was a concern about Title IX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3019)|
| 0:50:30| But then the applicant said that it wasn't a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| And then we said, well, we weren't concerned about being a problem even though Title IX issue was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| And so it just sounds like a double standard to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| It sounds like that you're applying something to this group that you hadn't applied to another group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| And I'm not saying that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| I'm just saying that's what it sounds like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| And I think if you had people who could respond without being put out, they would say it sounds like that to them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| And so my concern is that this is one of those legal things that puts us in a situation that we may not be able to do anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3064)|
| 0:51:18| We just got to suck it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| And so which is, you know, initially I felt like it was a slap in the face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| Now I think it's a kick dirt in my face and slap in my face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Can I do this, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Can I have Ms. Dean come up to speak on this occurrence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| Because she is representing the other party in the MOU and see what her statements are about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3096)|
| 0:51:45| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| But can I speak to your question about the Title IX just from my perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| Because I did vote for the charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| And, you know, I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| I rely on the advice that we are given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| And just from my perspective, you know, Mr. Dupler did discuss that with us to a point where I was reasonably comfortable with that aspect of the charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3125)|
| 0:52:20| It's not, you know, like I said, I was supportive of this Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| You know, I'm going to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| That's not what this is about to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| This is about the legality and, you know, my understanding is it's the burden is put on the local district, us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3150)|
| 0:52:45| to make sure once we have shared resources to make sure that those state curriculums are followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3165)|
| 0:52:56| And we have not ever had anything in place to evaluate an outside organization's curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3176)|
| 0:53:04| We've never had reason to have that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| And that was my understanding from talking to Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| Just to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| But I'm fine with Ms. Dean coming up and speaking to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| But part of that question of mine as well is that we don't have a way that is designed for us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| And we do have people who have experience in Knox County schools of reviewing material because they review textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3203)|
| 0:53:34| And we're not talking about thousands of books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| You know, we're talking about a book less for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| I think that, correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Rice, the curriculum that we review is, I mean, what we choose from is already chosen for us by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3224)|
| 0:53:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| I think that's the difference here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| And, again, Dr. Wilson, you may want to speak to that if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| But how that process works, I'll pass that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| But you're correct in what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Yeah, just I think I spoke to that process a bit the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| But, again, as we adopt curriculum that are used in our classrooms, there are state panels and groups that are convened to assess those materials for alignment to the law, support for the standards, all of those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3253)|
| 0:54:29| Certainly through high-quality instructional materials, additional pieces that go into those and requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| And from those, we have local teacher panels that then convene to assess from those choices what we want to adopt here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| So when we think about the role we play at a district level and the expertise, I guess, of the academic team to then review and deal in those materials, by and large, we're reviewing things that are already curated and selected at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3283)|
| 0:55:01| And then in the case of where we might have questions, which we do from time to time, around, say, text that are available in a library or supplemental materials that a teacher may choose and can choose to use in their classroom, our pathways for that are defined in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3301)|
| 0:55:17| And we are dealing in those moments in grounded in curriculum that we've adopted and expectations around those standards and those pieces that drive the instructional outcomes for our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3317)|
| 0:55:30| And then also if we find ourselves in situations where something were not being done correctly, we're also dealing in situations where we have oversight and management of those personnel and employees that are actually engaged in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3330)|
| 0:55:45| So it's a very different position to operate from when you're talking about a curriculum that doesn't belong to us and a program that we don't run or manage with personnel that we don't run or manage to try to start from scratch, so to speak, when we think about building curriculum and curating a collection that belongs to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3345)|
| 0:56:09| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Thank you, Madam Chair. I do want Ms. Dean to come up, but just in one second. I know Mr. Butler asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| Mr. Dupler, it's true that Freedom Schools on its own is not subject to that law, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3380)|
| 0:56:30| Yes, that's my understanding. I mean, this law specifically references an LEA, which is a school board or a public charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3390)|
| 0:56:43| And you talked about how the law is not very clear, and the way I can read those first two sentences is that within the LEA that it is not to include or promote within the LEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3403)|
| 0:56:55| I can also understand how it could be read outside of that, but what I'm hearing in this discussion is we have some thoughts about what the implications might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3415)|
| 0:57:07| But there is no definition in the law. There is no case law that says that if we provide buses to this organization, and should they be found to have broken this law or not be in compliance with it, again, it would not affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3427)|
| 0:57:20| It could potentially affect us, but we don't even know the answer to that question yet, whether or not they would or they would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| Ms. Dean, would you mind coming and speaking for just a moment? I would love to hear – you were here on Monday night, and I know that you listened intently to some of the concerns from the board and some of the – just back and forth in the dialogue as we try to process this and nuance this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3448)|
| 0:57:44| I'm wondering if you just have any thoughts to share out of that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| And then specifically, I know you've tried to look into this law since that night. I don't know how familiar you are with it before then, but also would love your thoughts on whether or not you believe Freedom Schools – not that you are subject to it, but that you would be, should you be subject to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3469)|
| 0:58:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| First thing I would say is when we had conversations with Knox County schools over the past few months – number of months, actually – we talked about three things in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3488)|
| 0:58:17| One was expanding our availability to more scholars in the community, and that's why we're at Spring Hill this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| We talked about data sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| And then I shared with them the importance of transportation, because that was one of the biggest barriers to the families that wanted to participate in Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3506)|
| 0:58:36| And I have to say, the conversation on Monday hurt to some extent, because there were assumptions made about what our program does and what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3516)|
| 0:58:48| And I would say unfounded, primarily because I think – I don't know how many of you have ever even attended a Freedom Schools session or even looked at our curriculum guide or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3528)|
| 0:58:59| So when I looked at 49-6-1019 and read through it, my husband and I actually – I mean, we checked off each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3539)|
| 0:59:08| And I'll just read some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| The lawyer didn't read all of them, but just some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| I really believe that Freedom Schools can easily abide by that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| Just as an example, we don't believe that because of one's race or gender they are inherently superior, privileged, racist, sexist, or oppressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3562)|
| 0:59:31| We do not believe anyone should be discriminated against due to their race or gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| We do not believe one's moral character is determined by their race or gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| We do not believe any individual bears responsibility for past actions committed by others regardless of their race or gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3579)|
| 0:59:48| When we went through all 14, that's just not how – that's not the Freedom School way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| That's not how we roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| We're about – we have our own Freedom Schools kind of core beliefs, and some of them are about we have respect for the emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual safety of ourselves and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3595)|
| 1:00:08| And we have beliefs, values, and practices that demonstrate the higher standards of honesty and integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| We're trying to raise up children who can read, can think, be thoughtful, who can be good citizens, who can be effective members of the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3614)|
| 1:00:25| There's nothing anti about what we do in terms of that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3625)|
| 1:00:35| Thank you, Ms. Dean. I appreciate that, and I appreciate you taking the time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| I know on Monday night there were several books that were referenced as maybe suggesting that maybe Freedom Schools does believe some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3640)|
| 1:00:54| I think it's important to note for the board that there's actually no specific laws mentioned – books mentioned in that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| That law is significantly up for interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| And you're saying tonight that you believe that Freedom Schools is in complete compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| I think some of the other comments I know were made the other night is that Freedom Schools has an agenda because it's associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3672)|
| 1:01:22| I'm curious what this agenda is for anybody who maybe brought that up because when I heard that that night, I'm trying to figure out what is the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3682)|
| 1:01:35| So alternative to what? So what's the right agenda and what's the one that we're concerned about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| And there was no definition or specificity brought out about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| And that could be helpful because if I were in your position, I would want to know what am I alternative to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| And I think that should be called out because I think it's important, irregardless of this bus contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3714)|
| 1:02:02| There was a lot of things that were said that had nothing to do with an MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| It was really about elevated concerns about a group trying to influence a segment of our population in negative ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3727)|
| 1:02:16| I mean that's what was being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Indoctrinating was the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Yeah, indoctrination was the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| So I don't know if any of the board members who spoke to that would be willing to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| But I would love to know what the ideal ideology is and what is the alternative one that we're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3745)|
| 1:02:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| Well, before we move into that, I just want to be clear on where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| And that is, you know, I don't feel comfortable with our structures in place for this or any organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3761)|
| 1:02:51| as far as monitoring an outside organization's curriculum when it comes to funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| So, and this is all I'm going to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| You know, I was supportive Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| I will support the MOU minus the transportation piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| And that's really all I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| I also have one point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| I know that typically we have public forum at the beginning of an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| And I know you suggested that we have board discussion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| But what I didn't hear is when will we have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| I just want to make sure the question doesn't get called and all that things, because sometimes that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| Well, if the question gets called, then we'll have public forum prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| But the motion now hasn't been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| I mean, I'm just saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| I just, and I'm not saying, don't hear me wrong, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| I'm not suggesting that you were trying to avoid public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| I'm just trying to understand, because it typically happens at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| I just felt, my intention with that was I felt from my personal conversations with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| To have more context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| That maybe people needed to have more context before they spoke at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| That was my only intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I just wanted to be clear for me when it is going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| We will have public forum before the vote, as we always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| But right now, actually, I might need to make a substitute motion in case that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| I believe the motion was to approve the MOU with a second, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| Is that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3869)|
| 1:04:37| So, Reverend Butler made a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| Ms. Owen, did you second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| So, before we go any further, I would like to make a substitute motion to approve the MOU minus the transportation piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3884)|
| 1:04:55| Point of order, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Before you make, before that is seconded, I didn't hear from Ms. Dean, being the party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3897)|
| 1:05:06| Has she been talked to about the part about the change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| Has she been, has that been discussed with her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Has she agreed to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| I mean, isn't a MOU something that both sides agree to before it comes to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| This is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| Or do we, can we, do we vote on it first and then we offer it to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| Well, I guess my thinking on that, Reverend Butler, was because of the timing of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| Because the mark is rapidly approaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| To do that, we would have to pull it off and it would delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| Yes, but I'm still thinking that the MOU, the motion that I made was the MOU that had been agreed upon between Knox County Schools and East Tennessee Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3944)|
| 1:05:58| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| I don't have a second on my motion, so I can just withdraw it and we can leave it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| I'm just wanting to know, how do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Because if we change it, then are we saying to her then she accept it as it is or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| Mr. Dickworth, can you weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| I've seen it done either way, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| I mean, sometimes, well, most of the time, it is as you described that both parties are aware of what's coming before the board and then the board approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3982)|
| 1:06:32| But there have been times when after a board has discussion that something has changed, then it becomes an offer to the other party, Freedom Schools in this case, and then Freedom Schools can accept or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=3992)|
| 1:06:52| Ms. Owen, I think you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| If we were talking about this bus piece from the perspective of the difference in time and the fact that the staff had somehow given us a very serious misrepresentation of how that was going to work, I could understand this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4020)|
| 1:07:20| But that's not the conversation we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| The conversation we're having makes no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| The reason we don't have guidance on how to evaluate an outside group's curriculum is because this law doesn't have jack to do with evaluating anybody's curriculum except our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4046)|
| 1:07:44| That there is no case law, I think, really helps my point because all we have is the law at its face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4064)|
| 1:07:52| And at its face, what it says is an LEA or public charter school shall not include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| And in that, it's talking about in our instructional program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| This is not our instructional program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| We are not promoting anything in our instructional program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| We are not promoting anything in our curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| We are not allowing our teachers or our employees or any public charter school's employees to use supplemental instructional materials in our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4096)|
| 1:08:28| This law is very specifically regarding the LEA's instructional program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| And it's, I mean, I've seen plenty of laws that our legislators don't understand that they themselves passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| But to say that this law in any way would hold us to looking at something that is completely outside, I mean so obviously outside of our instructional program that it's not even happening during the school year, that seems pretty ridiculous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4122)|
| 1:09:02| They've already said that even if we were looking at this and considering this, they're well within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4142)|
| 1:09:13| We could also look at this and say we also don't have a process or any guidance on how we would hold any of our charter schools to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4153)|
| 1:09:26| We would just trust that they would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| But that still shouldn't matter because this is specific to an LEA's course of instruction and curriculum, curriculum instructional program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4169)|
| 1:09:41| This is not our instructional program that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| It's completely separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| This isn't something that should even be a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| Now if we want to talk about the fact that the timeline is different for the buses, that would make sense to have a discussion about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| But it's just stupid to have a discussion about this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Ms. Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| I think this could be a question for Garfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| What is the cost of the busing contract for our summer schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| Do you know or is that a wrong question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| Technically we have individual contracts with contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| I can get you that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Do you know if there's a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| Would there be a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| Are you depending on this MOU for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Could you get us numbers on what the difference would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Actually, those were the ESSER dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| So that's a conversation for Ms. Himelgaard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| So we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| When you say a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| The additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| If this MOU is approved with the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| So we can look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| We do not pull those figures prior to any board approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Because that would be presumptuous on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I'm also curious what the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| So I know the difference technically between the contract that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| before and now is the busing and the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| But the way it was in previous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| would that leave us to the same liability or supposed liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| Maybe that's for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| I think we touched on this Monday that there's numerous outside entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| that go through the facility use procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| And that's all they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| They just go through the facility use procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| And if the schools aren't using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| then they pay for the janitorial staff and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| And then they use it on their own accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| So there's no school funding or promotion of the activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| So it's literally just because they're using the same busing contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| that would say that we are promoting this school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| That's the risk at this point, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4349)|
| 1:12:37| Have there previously been any complaints in the last six to seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| about this school made to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4362)|
| 1:12:53| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Thank you Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| I'm not aware of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| But again, I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| To Mr. Dupler's point, we don't have any jurisdiction over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| It's really a facility's use that they or any other organization could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| So there wouldn't be like a complaint structure back to the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| So it is family choice to go to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| just like there probably are 50 other organizations that run kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| summer programming that could be using Knox County Schools facilities as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| So they wouldn't, if they had those complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| they probably would do that through Freedom School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| not through, like it wouldn't come back to our English supervisor or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| Then I would just echo Reverend Butler in that if we're willing to risk a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| Title IX lawsuit for a charter school that's going to take millions of tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| dollars, that why wouldn't we allow this risk based on their guarantee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| I'm really, really confused on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Ms. Byke, hold on just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| I'm going to ask one more time respectfully that if we have to hear each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| other and I'm hearing noise out there and it's a conversation or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| that's distracting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| I'm just really confused on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| that it's just this busing nugget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| To answer Mr. Watson's question about what I feel like is a concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| agenda, if you go to their website on their homepage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| they have an article about banned books we love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| And those banned books are books that would fall, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| probably most likely under that state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| And East Tennessee Freedom Schools has as its parent organization the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Children's Defense Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| And that defense fund clearly has a goal to promote banned books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| Those books have content that I think create confusion among genders for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| children and any gain of reading and literacy would be certainly offset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| I believe, by this kind of content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| They have books about, and they list some of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| some racial division, sexual content, an LGBTQ agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| So those are the agenda that I feel like the Children's Defense Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| promotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| And the agenda I would like to see is one that is just clearly just about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| I don't know that you can get that through the Children's Defense Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| I'm also not ignorant enough to think that we are not, as Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Christie said, voting for them to exist or not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| They will continue to exist in the same way they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| I just believe personally that parents have trusted Knox County and any sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| of MOU, in my mind, is a partnership with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| And I can't partner with an organization, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| that promotes these kind of things, really at any level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| You may say, well, it's not a lot, or may or may not show up in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| schools, or in the Freedom Schools in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| but I cannot partner with an organization that promotes this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Mr. Triplett, thank you for shedding some light on what you referenced the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| I wasn't sure what blog post that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| So the blog post that you're referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| when you talk about issues of race and racism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| LGBTQI issues and sexual encounters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| you do realize that what they're referencing is just a catalog of books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| that are banned across the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| They're not saying that all of their books have that percentage of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Do you understand that piece correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Well, the reason I'm asking that is because you've referenced that several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| times as being the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| All they're saying is, across America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| pen America has tried to catalog the issues in all banned books across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| What CDF is not saying in that blog post is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| we endorse all these books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| That's not what they're saying, if you read the blog post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| Now they do have a list of books that they do endorse that's separate from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| And I'm curious, I'm not familiar with all the titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| I'm curious if you're aware of those titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Do you have concern with those specific titles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| I looked through some of them and some of that content is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| There is an LGBTQ content in that list of books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| Mr. Triplett, I'm not trying to be disrespectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| but you do understand that we have LGBTQ kids across our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| Do you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| I'm well aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| And I'm not in any way wanting to debate faith or your values or your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| beliefs or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| But I think when we get to the point where you're saying you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| make this decision based upon your personal beliefs and your personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| values about something that you think may be occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| but you don't know if it's occurring or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| And, I mean, rarely do I engage with anybody that I fully agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| I mean, there's rarely would that be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| But there's a lot of other things that would speak to me about a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| I mean, Marian Wright Edelman is actually still alive, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| the founder of CDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| And a couple of things that she said over time that I really appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| she says, when Jesus Christ asked little children to come to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| he didn't say only rich children or white children or children with two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| parent families or children who didn't have a mental or physical handicap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| He said, let all the children come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| I appreciate that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| She also said parents have become so convinced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Educators know what is best for children that they forget that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| themselves are really the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| We've talked a lot about parent choice, parental choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| the last couple of weeks, which I also appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| She also says education is for improving the lives of others and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| leaving your community and world better than you found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| And I can get down with that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| She also says services, the rent we pay to be living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| is the very purpose of life, not something you do in your spare time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| And when I see freedom schools, that's what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| I see people who for way more than it's existed in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| who has looked at a group of children who have been underrepresented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| that have been historically oppressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| again and again having to fight for a little scrap of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4772)|
| 1:19:40| And my concern is that we in the positions of power would say to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| but you don't get this scrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| And I know that nobody is saying this directly, but we do understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| we are talking about black children on buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| I mean, that's really what helped elevate and kick off the civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| And Mr. Triplett, I do respect, I know that's not what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| but that's what this community is hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| That is what they're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| And at some point I want that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| I want this community to hear the people in positions of power standing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| for them and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| succumbing to legislators who hear about a consent agenda item on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| Knox County Board of Education and get riled up and start rallying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| wagons about what we should or should not do on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| And I've walked in this community with Denise Dean for five years and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| woman has no agenda other than giving the children that she gets to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| with the very best and wants them to be giving the very best back to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| And the other thing that I know is there's people in leadership in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| district who have come through freedom schools and I'm not going to out them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| I'm not going to put their names out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| but they're damn good at what they do and they love children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| And I'm not trying to get all whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| but because I do I feel like what you're saying is authentic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| Like I get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| I totally understand that that's the journey you've been on and you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| gotten to this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| But what I'm asking you to do is I'm asking you to look at the community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| saying, yeah, but even though that's not my journey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| they're asking for something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| And nobody's asking you to sign on the dotted line and become a board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| of CDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Nobody's asking you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| Is it okay if I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| Or is there somebody else ahead of me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4912)|
| 1:21:59| Mike is ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| I would be fine with him responding and then I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| And I do understand there's a community that we serve and people we serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| and people that need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| I would agree with all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| I'm a fan of literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| I think anything we can do to promote literacy is good and valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| I speak no ill will towards those that are involved in freedom schools or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| work for freedom schools or have come through freedom schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| use the freedom schools, attend the freedom schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| I've got nothing, no ill will and nothing negative to say about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| I don't believe that – I don't believe I've said anything negative about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| them individually in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| I just know that the parent organization that oversees them is not something I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| can support and by her own admission Monday it was that she gets her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| curriculum from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| And I don't believe that I can support that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| I have a question for Ms. Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=4993)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I understand that you're working directly with some of these children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| and I'm curious how you would approach it if a child felt uncomfortable about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| some curriculum or a book that they were reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| Can you talk about it and see what the discomfort was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| Has that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| Have you encountered that before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| They might not have liked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Yeah, well, they're kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| But they weren't uncomfortable or felt out of sorts in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| Do you feel like you and the adults that are in the rooms with these children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| have the capacity to judge when a child is uncomfortable and to redirect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| That's good enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| So my question is, if we don't have a process that's determined for us to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5059)|
| 1:24:37| for outside organizations, and if we determine that the process is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5077)|
| 1:24:45| look at the curriculum, and if it violates any of those 14 tenets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| then we would say, okay, you can't use that particular book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| Would that be a legitimate way of determining?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| Because that's what Ms. Dean has said that she's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| So would that be a legitimate process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5103)|
| 1:25:11| Legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Would that be a legal process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| Because there's not one that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| All I can say, Reverend Butler, is perhaps, I mean, again, there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| I've got the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| You've got the same thing I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| I mean, you know, so I don't know that I can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| I mean, I think if the board votes for this MOU, then KCS administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5133)|
| 1:25:42| is going to have to come up with something to have some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| I mean, do I know exactly what that looks like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| But something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Yeah, and I think part of what I remember now is that when we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| the Title IX issue, and there was a concern from a number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| maybe not a number of people on this board, but a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| And I think the applicant said that they would take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| They would handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| It would be on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| And although we know if it's on them, it's on us, that we were comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| accepting that risk because there's a risk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| And we became comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Am I missing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Did we not become comfortable with that risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Am I missing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| Nobody is saying nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| I believe the option we were also given was that you said that it could close, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| I mean, that's the other option for a Title IX lawsuit is not just building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| another facility, but you could close down the one that the complaint was over, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| And if there's a complaint that comes against this, then we can stop the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| Because what page four, item number four on page four said that they would comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5224)|
| 1:27:13| with all federal, all state laws and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5233)|
| 1:27:21| And I may have in my mind put local in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| So if that's the case, that's already in the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| They've already said that we're going to comply with this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| And they've gone the extra mile to make sure that they're complying with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| We have a community, and it is two District 1 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5260)|
| 1:27:50| And I think one is in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| One is in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| All having two in District 1 are on the state's bottom five list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5280)|
| 1:28:08| They have literacy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| This is a summer literacy program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| Did we say that it doesn't cost Knox County Schools any money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| They're not asking for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| So we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| And I thank you, Ms. Christie, for saying that, OK, I can support the data sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| The data sharing is important because that helps the school do the best job they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5315)|
| 1:28:43| and know if they're doing the best job they can, know what they need to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| And also I think it does, it can over time give Knox County Schools an opportunity to see what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| how they can better utilize the relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| And they have a database, or they've used data to show that they've been successful over the last seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5340)|
| 1:29:11| of either maintaining or improving student learning from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| keeping the student learning from the end of the school year to the beginning of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| They've proven that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| They've had 90% or above a couple of years, 100% parent satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5363)|
| 1:29:30| So it's not the parents who are going to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| It's not the students who are going to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| They have community-based support from churches, from community nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| When we finally get to talk here from the public, there's a number of people here that have been in support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| and working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| And these are people who are not, don't have an alternative agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| This school doesn't have an alternative agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| This school has one agenda, and that is literacy for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| There are other byproducts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| And so even with the buses, you're not paying any more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| Now we know it's four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| You're not paying any more money in four weeks than you would be paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| And I don't know what Dan says for the two weeks, because I think we just found out that it was a two-week difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| in the last day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| So that can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| This is a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| I believe that's why it was on the consent agenda, because it's a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| And I think the only reason these state legislators got involved, quite honestly, this is what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| I can't prove this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| I hesitate to say it, but it's because it was a leverage deal to say, hey, you've got to make sure you can pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| You can pass the muster to this law if you want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| And so otherwise, we wouldn't be having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| But even with that, I believe that there's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| There's a little gray area of when we are promoting and when we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| There's a gray area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| And there's a gray area on what the procedure should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| And so we're concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| But I know I'm not the only one who think there was a gray area with the Title IX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| We just as a board, and I say we because we passed it, we as a board felt like that was a risk we could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| This is a risk we can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| Seven years of 100% or 90% satisfaction of parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| They're the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Now, this is what's key to me, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| This school serves primarily East Knoxville kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| It may be some kids from other areas, but primarily East Knoxville kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| And it has been serving, and it's going to continue serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| And it's almost like you're saying we're concerned it's going to affect our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| The people who have been going there have already been going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| So the concern you have about this thing, we've been fixed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| I said this as clear as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| You have people with high intelligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| You have people with high moral standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| And when we have something that concerns us, we speak up and we talk to one another, and it gets resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5540)|
| 1:32:27| And the other thing is that I'm going to go piggyback off what Mr. Watson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| Not only do we have students, we have teachers in Knox County that's part of the community that you have talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5553)|
| 1:32:45| And you have constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| And so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| The things we're talking about are things that we're already talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| There's not nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| So I guess what I'm saying is that the MOU, as it's written, works for East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5578)|
| 1:33:09| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| I can't speak for District 2, but I know Spring Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| I've been at Spring Hill several times, been to several Spring Hill school plays and such because I've had members of the church that go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5594)|
| 1:33:23| So it fits their community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| I have two kids that's a member of the church that goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| I've been there to visit them at Spring Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| This works for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| Freedom School works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| And I'm not saying it's not for you, but you're not utilizing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| Why not let us have what we need to keep on trying to increase the literacy for our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5625)|
| 1:33:52| That's what's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| And when you add the buses, you expand it to more kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| This is not a danger to us unless someone outside of East Knoxville makes it a danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5638)|
| 1:34:06| This is not a danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| This works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| So somebody said to me, if you bring me something that makes sense, not going to cost a lot of money and improves education, that I would vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5649)|
| 1:34:17| And that's what we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| This is a win for East Knoxville, and I really believe it's a win for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5660)|
| 1:34:31| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| We had a little bit of discussion about this law when it came to setting our priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| because ultimately the board voted to send a message to the legislation that, hey, we really appreciated what you did with this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5678)|
| 1:34:47| And maybe that's why they're calling us, because they want to give us kudos back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| But this law, the reason I voted no that particular night is because this whole law is couched in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5690)|
| 1:35:00| That's what this law is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| It's about people being afraid about other people being told to – for white kids to being told you should feel bad about yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5702)|
| 1:35:12| or that black kids are going to be told that you shouldn't like white kids because they oppress you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| or you shouldn't – don't say gay and all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| This law is based in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| And some of this conversation has been based in fear, in indoctrination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| I had a person that I have known for 20 years in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| His kids were actually in the youth group that I ran when they were younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| And he emailed me today, and he said – and he doesn't live anywhere near East Knoxville –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| and he said, I'm afraid of how this is going to affect my grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5746)|
| 1:35:52| That's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| I'm not making this stuff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| That's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| He said, I'm afraid of how this is going to affect my grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| And we had a little dialogue about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| One, he's never going to enroll his kids in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| I guarantee you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| But that's the bigger problem with this whole conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| Even the risk that we're talking about, it's couched in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| It's about, ooh, what might the legislature do to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| And I don't want to operate out of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| And that's so much of what's happening in our culture today is we're making decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| and we're making decisions from the seat of power couched in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| And when we do that, it affects those that it's been affecting for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| And honestly, I don't know if Ms. Dean would appreciate me saying this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5800)|
| 1:36:47| but Ms. Dean actually told me a little bit ago that this was going to be coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| and she just told me that, hey, I'm going to have this thing, and I'm going to come to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| I said, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| I said, I think you should be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| And I messaged her earlier in the day on Monday to say, hey, Ms. Dean, when you do come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| would you like me to call you up so you could speak in support of Freedom Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| Because it was on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| Like I thought nobody was going to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| I was just asking her permission to call her up so she could like just speak to the beautiful program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| that she's been operating for six years because – and I've done that several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| You all have seen me do that with other people, Ellie Kitchrell and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| because I want them to speak about the good work that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| I could not fathom that a program like this that has these kinds of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| I'm in the nonprofit world, and we care a lot about output and outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| and being able to speak to the efficacy of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| You're not going to get this level of outcomes in many other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| We don't see these level of outcomes around literacy in our own organization, in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| That's because we're dealing with a massive system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| I know it's a completely different scale, but they do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| Regardless of what happens with this decision, as a board, as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5878)|
| 1:38:05| as people in this particular group and people of positions of power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| we have to move beyond operating out of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| I guarantee you there's going to be some public forum speakers up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| that are going to come up here in a little bit, and they're going to speak out of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| I guarantee you that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| I don't know who they're going to be, but they're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| That's not what we need to be doing because when we are afraid of one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5909)|
| 1:38:36| it's very hard to move forward as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| Man, I'm so disappointed in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| I mean, I'm just disappointed, and it's not about no freaking buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| It's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| I have a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| First, I have reached out to some of our local band directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| because they know bus costs for that kind of short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| and they are looking at around $250 to $300 a day for a local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| like traveling from Carnes to Gibbs, that kind of football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| And so if we are looking at two weeks of time, the additional time it would take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| it would be roughly $9,000 or less for three buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| which is, to put that in perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| it's roughly the amount of our school board raise that we got this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| So I would like to, since Reverend Butler kindly mentioned Spring Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| I would like to share an email that we all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| that we may not have had time to read today from our principal at Spring Hill Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| It says, our summer learning camp has prioritized enrollment for our rising fourth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=5997)|
| 1:40:04| I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| Our summer learning camp has prioritized enrollment for our rising fourth graders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| due to the third grade retention law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Freedom Schools stepped up to offer more programs to schools like Spring Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| with high projection numbers of students needing summer intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| They are extending a helping hand to soften the blow of additional summer learning gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| by hosting the program at our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| and offering to enroll students who won't be eligible to attend the summer learning camps through KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6033)|
| 1:40:42| As a community school, we are grateful when the community reaches out when they see a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| I was honored to work with Freedom School when it first came to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| I became a better teacher after the intense training they provided each year for their teaching staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| Now, as an administrator, we begin our school day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| with our students coming together for morning assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| which is something I learned from the Freedom School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| We're building a school culture at Spring Hill where we come together daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| to learn from and support one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| Offering Freedom School at Spring Hill will strengthen our efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| the efforts we began, and push our students to become better readers and overall better people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| I hope we move forward with Freedom School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| so they can continue empowering our students through the love of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| Why on earth would we not do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6090)|
| 1:41:40| Alright, so do we have any other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| I do ask, can we have the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| and then after that, if there is, we can see where we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| Yeah, so once it looks like our discussion is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| so we can move to public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| We have several people signed up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| First, Dr. Andrew Steen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| Are you here, Dr. Andrew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| Hello, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| Please just state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6142)|
| 1:42:30| Thank you, I'm Dr. Andrew Steen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| I live in Knox County and have a couple of kids in the schools here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| I'm also a professor in the Department of Microbiology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| and Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| and I'm asking the school board to approve the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| Like most researchers, I love to share my passion for science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| not only with UT students, but also with anyone who wants to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| and particularly with K-12 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| And what I love about science is the thrill of discovering the unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| When we make a new scientific finding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| there's a moment when we as researchers know something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| that no one else on earth knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| And that feeling is electrifying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| and I can tell you from experience, it never gets old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| So for two years, Dr. Joy Bongiorno, who's here tonight from Maryville College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| and I have been collaborating with East Tennessee Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| to involve the ETFS scholars in authentic science research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| So by involving middle schoolers in real, live science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| my hope is to teach them how exciting science can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| That experience will hopefully lead the ETFS scholars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| to be more invested in their STEM classes as they enter high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| and perhaps to pursue STEM careers as they become adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| Educational research supports the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| that when students participate in science research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| they're more likely to maintain positive attitudes about STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| And that stands to reason, because doing science research can be a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| In a previous iteration of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| in which I worked with high school students in New Jersey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| led to over 60 high school students presenting their research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| at real professional science meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| One of those students was accepted at Harvard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| and she was the first student in memory from her high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| to attend an Ivy League university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| ETFS is a really great partner for this work for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| First of all, in my experience, ETFS scholars are highly motivated to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| Second, and this is critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| they're also learning reading and comprehension skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| that are essential to doing STEM work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| So the reality is that a budding scientist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| who is driven to read widely and understand well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| is more likely to be successful in STEM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| than somebody who just knows a lot of science facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| Research, and also common sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| suggests that the best way to get students invested in reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| is to encourage them to read works that they relate to personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| The ETFS curriculum does that extremely well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| and I can attest that it does not in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| violate the ideas listed in section 49-6-1019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| ETFS scholars being able to take school buses to the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| will be tremendously helpful in making sure that all scholars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| who might benefit from the program can take part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| This MOU represents an excellent way for Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| to help Knox County students learn both reading and STEM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| outside of the traditional classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| and for that reason I hope that you will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| So our next speaker is from out of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6332)|
| 1:45:40| so we'll have to vote on that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| Yes, Ms. Susan, and I'm so sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| I'm going to butcher your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| Ms. Susan is what I will call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| So since you live out of Knox County, we'll just have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| Can you stand right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Can you stand right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| So I'll make a motion that we vote on this speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| All those in favor of letting Ms. Susan speak, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| Oh, I shouldn't have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| I'm sorry, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| That's fine, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| I kind of like you taking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| Why don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| You can be Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Okay, Ms. Susan, just state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| Okay, my name is Dr. Susan Granke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| I am a resident of Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| I'm a professor of English education at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| where for the past 18 years I've helped prepare over 200 beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| middle school, and high school English language arts teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| I say that because I am very, very familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| I have to be very familiar with the Tennessee law on prohibitive concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| because we have a partnership with Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| and all of our students are required to do a year-long internship in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| Knox County Schools, and so we train them on that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| Prior to starting my career at the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| I taught middle and high school English| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| and went to graduate school to obtain my Ph.D. in curriculum and instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| I have had the honor to work as a curriculum writer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| for the Children's Defense Fund Freedom Schools Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| and I can attest that the curriculum is rigorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| It is standards-based, and it does not violate Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6454)|
| 1:47:41| The curriculum is centered on the theme of I can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| So each week of the six-week program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| the children read books that encourage them to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| how they can make a difference in their own lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| their communities, their families, and the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| The children's books themselves are carefully selected and vetted each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| by a committee of university professors, school media specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6487)|
| 1:48:13| community stakeholders, and members of the prestigious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| Coretta Scott King Honor Book Award Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| As expressed at the meeting on May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| parents of the children who participate in this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| are familiar with the curriculum, they support the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| and they express satisfaction with the Freedom Schools Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| For the past six years, this program has run for Knox County Schools children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| without a single complaint from parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| In fact, popularity of the program is such that additional sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| to accommodate programming are needed, as is easy access to these sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| If Knox County Schools parents' rights are important to members of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| let's keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| Let's also keep in mind what research tells us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| about who has access to engaging reading materials over the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| We know that students in underserved communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| have less access to reading material at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| than their more advantaged peers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| Researchers have found roughly ten times greater access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| to reading material in higher-income neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| than in lower-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| There is no Barnes & Noble, or Target, or Union Avenue Books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6564)|
| 1:49:30| or other commercial bookstores in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| And the Burlington branch of the Knox County Public Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| is located on a highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| Here we have a popular program that wants to bring award-winning books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| and high-quality reading curriculum to the most...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| Thank you. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| ...vulnerable youth in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| I urge you to vote yes to Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| APPLAUSE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| Erin Keck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| You've signed up for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| I'll split my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| Erin Keck, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| I am also a parent representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| on the Region 5 Family Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| which the Freedom Schools is directly in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| I appreciate being selected for that group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| and us parents have put in a lot of hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| trying to coordinate the strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| specifically for Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| We were told that Region 5 is going to get lots of support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| so I would hope this vote would be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| Do you want to know why I'm here every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| why you guys see me here month after month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| The reason that I'm here every month is because I care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| I care about Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| I care about public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| I care about my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| I'm a graduate of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| I'm a parent of a child in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| I've served on any parent community committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| that I've been allowed to serve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| I'm an educator and have been for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| And I believe that, like a board member has stated tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| I am blown away that this conversation is even happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| There is no reason for any board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| to vote against the Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| You have selected Dr. Reiswick as your superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| Your faith is in him and his priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| If you vote against this, you are saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| you don't care about the success for every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| you don't care about the early foundational skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| because this program has proven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| that they complete both of those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| They assist the children in my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| that desperately need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| Last month, we heard a lot about parent choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| the hypocrisy of saying only certain parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| and only certain choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| These parents have given 100% satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| That is a parent choice that they have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| You don't have to send your kid there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| but don't take it away from these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| I hope that at least one of you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| actually ran for school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| because you care about the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| and you care about what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Even those of you that I strongly disagree with most of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| I've seen you do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| so I hope you'll do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| I'll save my last minute for the other agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6740)|

| 1:52:32| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| Vivian Scheidt, 503 Longview Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Tonight, you will vote on an MOU for the Freedom School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| that will make the learning experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| of children in the inner city much easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| over the coming summer months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| The key word to the success of this next level of collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| is focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| There is much minutiae swirling around this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| However, you only have two items on which to focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| One, to provide for children who have no other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| to get the help they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| a seat on a bus that is already going to the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| where their needs could be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| The second, to data share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| to see where the children stand scholastically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| and to share that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| to allow those who have been doing this work successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| for seven years the opportunity to improve the children's skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| and help them retain knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| that children all over the country are losing due to summer slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| I ask you to focus only on these two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| I ask you to give Freedom Schools the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| to show you what the community they serve already knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| Children put down their phones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| and pick up their books and want to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| They put down a phone that already shows them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| anything they want to see, good and bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| at the touch of a finger or at the sound of their voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| Instead, at the Freedom School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| they turn their focus to a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| who wants to be there with them in the hot summer days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| They listen to community members who volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| to come in to do activities and read to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| sharing the most precious thing they can offer, their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| Generation Alpha is 13 and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| They only know technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| They socially interact with devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| Majority of their time here in the Freedom School programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| are opportunities to physically occupy space with another human,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| to learn how to communicate, to fall in love with reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| to see and experience a world outside of theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| to learn, to use all of their senses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| to go back into the fall session more confident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| not lagging behind, ready to learn the new skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| of the new grade level they have moved to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| Without playing catch-up for the first half of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| So tonight, look neither left nor right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| Choose not to look too far down the road to the next MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| Tonight, focus on what is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| for those children in one of the most critical times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| in our education history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| If you will focus tonight on just these two items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| they will be able to focus this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| I ask you to vote yes on the MOU for the Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| Kenneth Herring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| Kenneth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| Is Kenneth here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| Just state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| My name is Kenneth Herring, and I'm a resident of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| and I live here in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| First of all, Susan, where's Susan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| Susan, thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| Danny, thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| I appreciate you all speaking with me about the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| I come to you today as a former Freedom School counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| As a matter of fact, I was a Freedom School counselor in 1999,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| the first year that Freedom School kicked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| I've heard a couple of words today that have really struck a nerve with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| and those being fear and honesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| I think if we're going to be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| then we need to talk about several different elements of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| several of which have been talked about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| I think the most challenging thing that we can look at this and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| and take from it is we have an opportunity right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| to invest in young people, and we're trying to fight it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| And the reason that we're trying to fight it is that there's fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| And I'm going to say what Daniel alluded to and kind of talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| and the fear is that if black and brown children are exposed to American history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7006)|
| 1:56:53| that white parents are fearful that their children will hate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| And that's what we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| And once again, as has been the process throughout American history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| black and brown people are forced with the burden of ending division and racism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| which is asinine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| It's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| It's never benefited us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| We've never gained anything from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| So for us to be asked to make sure that we don't make people feel uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| to be asked to make sure that we don't let our children have a space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| where they can learn and be together and grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| it's a continuation and it's a disenfranchisement of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| that you have an opportunity to help and you're choosing not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| And I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| I run a business, so I understand working with unions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| I understand budget constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| I understand things that you can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| And I also understand when you use policy and legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| as a way to not do something that you should do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| as a way to not invest in people that you should invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| These are children who are already struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| These are children who already are facing barrier after barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| And here we sit, all of us, privileged enough to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| and yet the thing that we're talking about is how we can not help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| instead of how we can help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| The attitude of not is really, really detrimental to children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| who already don't have a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| As I sit here today and stand and talk to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| I had seven Freedom School counselors that went to that program with me in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| Two of them, on this very day, teach in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| One of them is an administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| So the ideology and the thought process that there's harmful rhetoric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| that there's harmful words, that there's harmful things that are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| is not true because the people that have gone through that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| are leading our students right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7132)|

| 1:59:22| for Latino families in Knox County and the surrounding region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| I'm also a parent of two Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| I'm here speaking in support of the East Tennessee Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| This is a program that I've been aware of for at least the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| in my work with education in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| I was so impressed by the program's curriculum and guiding values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| that I have repeatedly sought every opportunity to meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| and collaborate with the program's director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| Ms. Dean and I serve together on several local advisory boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| that seek to improve educational outcomes for all children in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| What most attracted me to East Tennessee Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| is the emphasis on culturally relevant materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| and educators that come from shared experiences and backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| are the students that they are working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| These reflect similar strategies that we utilize in our programs at Centro Hispano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| These strategies are important because research has shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| that utilizing culturally relevant texts in which readers can see themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| and their experiences reflected leads to greater engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| and literacy of outcomes among students from underrepresented groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| Freedom Schools also works hard to recruit staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| with shared experiences with their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| This is particularly important in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| which has struggled to attract and retain teachers of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| The Knox County student population currently is 17% black and 12% Hispanic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| and yet only 3% of teachers identify as African American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| and just over 1% of teachers identify as Hispanic or Latino.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| Why does this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| Well, multiple studies have shown that having educators that look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| and have shared cultural backgrounds with students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| can have long-lasting positive impacts on their academic outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| For example, an economically disadvantaged black male's exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| to at least one black teacher in elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| reduces his probability of dropping out of high school by nearly 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| Unfortunately, the chances that black male students in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| will encounter a black teacher in their elementary school are very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| However, participation in East Tennessee Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| helps supplement these experiences by utilizing educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| that are much more likely to reflect the diversity of students they are working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| The attacks on East Tennessee Freedom Schools are perhaps most perplexing to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| because they come at a time when Knox County Schools is struggling to meet the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| to address literacy scores in its students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| particularly in the exact populations that Freedom Schools specialize in serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| In the last DOE report card, only 19% of black students and 22% of Hispanic students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| are meeting or exceeding grade-level expectations in literacy and math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| This week we've heard that Knox County Schools cannot meet the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| for all the students that have been needed to go to summer learning camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7308)|
| 2:01:55| So it doesn't make any sense to me why KCS is turning students away from summer learning supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| but our own school board members are attacking an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| that prepared to provide additional literacy support for these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| For the past three years, we've heard about how we need to come together to help our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| This organization is trying to do that and trying to support Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| and it doesn't make any sense to not support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| Reverend Leah Burns. Reverend Leah Burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7344)|
| 2:02:37| Good evening. My name is Reverend Leah Burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| I'm the pastor at Linencini United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| And you will have to vote on me. I am a former resident of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| but I live in Anderson County, so please vote so that I can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| So I'll make a motion to approve this speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| I second that motion. All those in favor of the speaker? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| All those opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| Thank you very much for listening to my words and the words of all who will speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| As I said, I'm Reverend Leah Burns, and I'm from Linencini.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| And before I get started, I came to speak on behalf of supporting the MOU for the Freedom Schools that I dearly love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7397)|
| 2:03:27| But before I do that, I want to start with one of the things that we say at the beginning of each day during Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7407)|
| 2:03:36| If you're familiar with Freedom Schools, you know that there are energetic cheers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| There are chants. There are songs to get children ready for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| And one of the things that they say is, I have a recognition. I have a recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7427)|
| 2:03:56| I recognize the great value that Freedom School has, in particular, for all the children in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7436)|
| 2:04:06| They have access to books. They have access to experiences. They have access to learning during the summer months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7446)|
| 2:04:16| They have access to breakfast and lunch that they do not get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7456)|
| 2:04:23| And so why are we standing in the way of what we are to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| The quote that you already heard today is the quote that I was prepared to share with you all today from Marian Wright Edelberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7469)|
| 2:04:38| But it's worth repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| When Jesus Christ asked the little children to come to him, he didn't say only certain children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7480)|
| 2:04:47| He didn't say the children whose parents agree with what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| He didn't say only the children in two-parent families that I recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| or only the children who don't have mental or other physical handicaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7496)|
| 2:05:02| He said, let all the children come to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| We have an opportunity with the Freedom Schools to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| And all I've heard, all I've read, is how people want not to provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7510)|
| 2:05:17| I know that there are smart people in this room, here and here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| We can put our heads together and figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| We've got a law before us that few people even understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| We don't even have a process for dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| And so I say, why let any of those things get in the way of helping our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7534)|
| 2:05:42| get in the way of helping them be the adults that we know they can be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7542)|
| 2:05:48| And so I ask, no, actually, I'm imploring you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| I implore you as a board, don't impede the future of our children and the future of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7553)|
| 2:06:02| This is a risk, yes, but it's a risk that we have to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| And so I end with how I started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| I have a recognition, and it's called Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| Denise Dean, Denise Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| Oh, and we will have to, no, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| But we will have to vote on you as a speaker just because you do live out of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| Denise Dean, Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| I'll make a motion to approve this speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| This time I'm reading, just sharing a letter from a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| I think you may have received it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| The Children's Defense Fund East Tennessee Freedom Schools Summer Program is a six-week-long summer enrichment program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| with three hours of reading per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| The program helps children fall in love with reading and increases their self-esteem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| cultivates positive attitudes toward learning, and reduces summer reading loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7622)|
| 2:07:08| According to the 2022 assessment, the data shows that 84% of children improved or maintained their instructional reading level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7628)|
| 2:07:15| 100% of parents say their child is a better reader, has more confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| and believes they can make a difference in their community, schools, and society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| As a member of the community and a parent of a Knox County school student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| my son has been in intervention reading at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| and with the additional help he received from East Tennessee Freedom Schools Summer Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| has helped him increase his reading level and become confident in his studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| He loved the program because he was exposed to the history of his culture and other cultures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| He learned about different cultures through reading, songs, instruments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| and other things that raised awareness about others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| He learned also the importance of loving, sharing, and caring about other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| and to accept their differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| Also finding the joy in reading, he has increased his test scores in reading and math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7675)|
| 2:08:00| and he attempts to read 20 minutes a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| and realizes the importance of reading that he gained while attending East Tennessee Freedom Schools Summer Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| As a parent, I enjoyed East Tennessee Freedom Schools and liked the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| and my son plans to attend this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| Therefore, I'm concerned that the KCS School Board's decisions for the East Tennessee Freedom Schools Summer Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| are inspired more by politics and personal views than a commitment to our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7701)|
| 2:08:26| history of our education, and other cultures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| Teaching the importance of reading by learning about others' cultures, histories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7709)|
| 2:08:33| that mean confronting history's complexity that many of us are not willing to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7713)|
| 2:08:38| It is a blessing that it is taught at East Tennessee Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| On the other hand, providing transportation for our students is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7722)|
| 2:08:47| due to some not having transportation or parents working and unable to provide transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| This program has helped students become better students in their schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| and will be a great asset to society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| In closing, I hope that transportation will be provided to East Tennessee Freedom Schools Summer Program by KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| and the curriculum will remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| The program has grown and thrived throughout the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| by providing the support and education to our students and families of the Summer Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| And this is from Christy Blevins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| Elizabeth Garcia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7759)|
| 2:09:27| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| My name is Liz Garcia and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| I hold a Ph.D. in literacy education with an emphasis in children's literature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| I'm the author of 70 educational stories for children and I've been an educator for more than 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| I've also volunteered many hours supporting Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| and I can say with full confidence that this program is the best summer literacy program I have ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7787)|
| 2:09:55| We are so lucky to have this program available to children here in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| It's no secret that we have a literacy crisis in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| Voters want to see this board acting to positively address that crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| Current demand for summer literacy enrichment offerings exceeds the county's capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| Yet we're calling into question the heart of partners who've offered us a proven successful program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| that's helped some of our most vulnerable and under-resourced students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| maintain and improve their reading levels year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| This unfounded distrust and paranoia echoes sentiments from decades long past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7822)|
| 2:10:28| Today's Freedom Schools program has its roots in the Civil Rights era Freedom Summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| In 1964, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee sent hundreds of white college students to Mississippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| to register black voters and to run Freedom Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| summer enrichment programs for young black Mississippians who suffered in an educational environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| where their literacy was not prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| According to PBS, when the local white community heard that this Freedom Summer was going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| many people reacted with suspicion and fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| In Jackson, Mississippi, the city increased their jail capacity and they even bought and armed a tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7854)|
| 2:11:01| Instead of letting fearful community members outside of East Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| tank the modern day Freedom Schools program with speculative fears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| I ask you to look at the hard data and facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| The local Freedom Schools program has been an outstanding partner to Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| providing countless hours of summer enrichment and other resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| that have led to 80% of local participating scholars maintaining or exceeding their reading levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| Nationally, data on over 7,000 students who've gone through the program during the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| demonstrates over 85% of students maintaining or improving their reading skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| with the majority improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| This success rate bears out in other national peer-reviewed studies of the Freedom Schools program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| In a 2020 study of over 400 scholars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| they found that significant gains happened for students reading at frustration levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| So students who were having such a struggle to read that their frustration just got in their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| they just couldn't even do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| After they participated in Freedom Schools, they were able to read with greater ease and confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| The same study particularly found strong skills development in students with a history of great repetition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| The national program has also been recognized by the Harvard Family Research Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| for demonstrating ongoing success in providing quality learning opportunities for youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| As Mr. Watson said, it's painfully ironic that nearly 60 years after Freedom Summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| we're having a discussion on whether predominantly black students get to ride a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| Please approve the MOU for these kids to use buses we're already running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| Let's keep the county moving ahead instead of getting left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| Andre Canty. Andre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7946)|
| 2:12:32| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| Just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| I'm Andre Canty and as of month now officially back in Knox County, so I'm back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| So I'm going to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| I was the former co-chair of the Disparity Educational Outcomes Committee a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| Knox 10, Tennessee called me a professional agitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| Y'all can just call me Andre, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| So why am I here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| There's always been delay and doubt when it comes to the benefit of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| It's why we wasn't integrated until 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| It's why the recommendation that we put forth years ago with the DEO task force was delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| while we were hearing match numbers for Project RED and while we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| There's always doubt and delay when it comes to the benefit of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| So why are we here again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| It works. Freedom Schools works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| In fact, I have this thank you note right here from some kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| I came for a reading, a book called Marvelous World.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| It wasn't anything superior as far as race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| Let's talk about the human race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| It was a black kid beating up aliens, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| So I think that's okay, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| I did a little dance to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8022)|
| 2:13:43| I embarrassed myself and everything, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| But the important part was that these kids got to listen and read about black kids, black heroes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8026)|
| 2:13:56| their own culture, their own people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| And it builds their confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| It builds their self-esteem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| I'm an English major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| I read Beowulf I don't know how many times, Weathering Heights, The Great Gatsby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8042)|
| 2:14:09| It had nothing to do with my development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| It had nothing to do with what I saw in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| But those books were important to me in my development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| Not a lot about people who look like me, but I guess what Freedom Schools are all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| And the text that was brought forth that was in question, we're talking about text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| A lot of these kids are living out that text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| They're living what 1619 was written about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| They're living all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| We're talking about text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| Their experiences of why these texts are written, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| And it doesn't make anybody superior or have anybody attacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| I watched Rosewood in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| They talked about a black town decimated by a false accusation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| Went to South Door Middle, I was just fine, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| Read Malcolm X, I was just fine, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| These kids are smarter than what you think they are, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| And the people that are involved, the teachers, the parents, everybody involved are backing this up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8100)|
| 2:15:08| So the question, Freedom Schools, in spite of the validity, in spite of the impact that it has on District 1, District 2, and minority kids throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8108)|
| 2:15:20| are why books like 1619 exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| And if this MOU is not passed with transportation, I wouldn't be worried about 1619.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8124)|
| 2:15:30| I'd be worried about how history talks about this board and what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8130)|
| 2:15:35| And with that, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| Patty King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| Patty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| Patty King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| Can we keep the clapping down a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| Because we're trying to get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| We have 14 more just on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| So if you guys can just keep the clapping down, we'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| The speakers can't hear me calling their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| Patty King, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| I'm here to speak against this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| I've heard a lot of people saying we're speaking out of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| I'm going to tell you a little of my history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| Because some school board members are saying that this is based on fear and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8172)|
| 2:16:24| When I was in elementary school, I was one of two white kids in my entire elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8184)|
| 2:16:33| I know what it's like to have the economy and all of that that everybody says District 1 and District 2 has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8193)|
| 2:16:51| I lived it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| I lived it from all of my elementary years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| This isn't about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| This is about a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| This is about a law that can cause issues with Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| And that is why I'm speaking out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| We have been reached out to by legislatures as members of their constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8230)|
| 2:17:19| And I want to let you know, I do feel sorry for these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8239)|
| 2:17:26| I would be right there helping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| And I do help them with my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| I just want you guys to know that it's a law that we're fighting and talking against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| Not Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| Freedom Schools, like any other people, can use the schools all they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| But it would be the same thing if another group that other people did not agree with was to come and want to use the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8264)|
| 2:17:55| There would be the same fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| Phillip Sherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| Thank you, Betsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8286)|
| 2:18:07| My name is Dr. Phillip Michael Sherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| I'm a president of Knox County Schools, a professor of religious studies, and chair of the Division of Humanities at Maryville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8289)|
| 2:18:15| And I'm here to voice my support for reaffirming this MOU with the Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| I, too, was a bit surprised, and I've become more surprised hearing the conversation this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8299)|
| 2:18:25| But a few members of the board were raising questions about our connection to this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| I believe the Freedom Schools do important and vital work, both academically and socially, for students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8310)|
| 2:18:37| And the time is right to renew this partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| I'm especially concerned, given reports that Knox County Schools is facing staffing shortages for its own summer programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| at precisely the time when around 60 percent of rising fourth graders may need to access summer educational programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8326)|
| 2:18:53| I would suggest these partnerships are a lifeline we cannot afford to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| This past June, Dr. Reiswick shared his four priorities for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| The first priority was excellence in foundational skills, particularly early literacy and middle school math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8342)|
| 2:19:08| I know there's broad agreement on this board about the importance of these foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8348)|
| 2:19:13| Reading initiatives, like one book, Read City, testified of the work members of the board are already doing to strengthen student literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8353)|
| 2:19:21| and instill a love of learning at an early age. I'm grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| If there are legitimate, nonpartisan concerns about the curricula utilized by the Freedom Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| it sounds to me as though parents are being given an informed choice as to whether or not they want their students to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8371)|
| 2:19:38| I believe the Board of Education should err on the side of providing a wide range of choices for parents and families wherever possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8378)|
| 2:19:45| even if some members of the board might not choose that curricula for their own children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| In truth, many of the concerns I heard in the work session and have heard this evening seem to simply echo political talking points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| which should have little to no bearing on the local work of this Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| I've been deeply concerned for some time with the shift to a partisan election for the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| and I think we're seeing the results of that shift this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| I know that some members of the current board have expressed their desire for more deliberative discussions amongst members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8409)|
| 2:20:18| And while members may now be elected with a party label attached to their name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| they are elected to fully serve all of the faculty, staff, students, and families of Knox County, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8422)|
| 2:20:30| That is a very diverse population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| Personal convictions, even deeply held ones of individual board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| should not be allowed to deny students opportunities to learn and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| I do not believe the students of Knox County, especially those who are most in need of summer programming to help retain and strengthen literacy and math skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8444)|
| 2:20:50| should have their options limited because of larger political debates, or to score points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| or because the state legislature told the Republican members of this board how they ought to vote on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| Simply put, a vote against the MOU is a vote against literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| You cannot say you support literacy and then decide which books you think other people's children ought to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8465)|
| 2:21:12| Thank you. Matthew Best. Matthew Best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8472)|
| 2:21:21| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| Welcome. I saw you running. You got some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| Just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| Matthew Best. I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| My name is Matthew Best and I currently serve as the Executive Director of the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| I've had the pleasure of working with young people in this city for at least the last seven years or so, mostly in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8500)|
| 2:21:46| And I've seen the impact of Freedom Schools on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| In a state that ranks as close to the bottom in education as we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| I find it hard to believe that there is even a consideration of pulling support for a program that focuses on elementary education at its core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8513)|
| 2:22:00| Aside from the obvious benefits to the students, I've seen the way Employment Freedom Schools serves the college students and the young adults that staff these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8520)|
| 2:22:07| the leadership development and skill formation that happens for them, while also serving kids in the community is invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8527)|
| 2:22:14| All you have to do is attend one of the Freedom Schools training sessions for even just five minutes to see how energetic these programs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| and what a phenomenal learning environment these folks are creating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| I've also been impressed with the curriculum for the program and how empowering it is for children of all backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| One of my mentees is a high school student and career magnet, but he attended Freedom Schools when he was younger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| and he wanted me to share this message with you all this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| He said that Freedom Schools was the first time he remembers being exposed to books written by folks that looked like him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8557)|
| 2:22:44| about stories that were familiar to him, and featuring pictures of kids that looked like him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| The importance of that cannot be overstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| The last thing I'll say is a bit selfish in nature, but last summer I had the pleasure of being a guest reader at the program at Sarah Moore Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| and I can honestly say that it was quite the rewarding experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| to see these kids who had clearly fallen in love with reading and learning over the course of the program was such a gift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8582)|
| 2:23:09| and I know countless other professionals and community members were fortunate to have similar experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| I and other readers get to show all of these kids what's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| and hopefully inspire them to go on to do incredible things and to pursue excellence in their academic endeavors and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8597)|
| 2:23:24| I would implore anyone here to find a legitimate reason to stop supporting such a valuable program that has served our kids for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8604)|
| 2:23:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| James Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| James Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| Please state your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| James Moore, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| I'm speaking in favor of approving this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| My wife and I have two children that have attended Freedom School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| My oldest son has been gone for the last six years, and my youngest son has been gone for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| I also have a daughter that graduates next week from graduate school, and she did an internship at Freedom School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| We chose Freedom School because we were looking for ways for our kids to continue learning over the summer break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8645)|
| 2:24:11| Freedom School has exceeded our initial expectations, and we are huge advocates of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| We donate our time, our money into this program, and we're also very careful of what we allow our kids to be exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8658)|
| 2:24:26| We have never seen anything remotely concerning us in Freedom School in their curriculum or the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8666)|
| 2:24:33| This program has done nothing but help our children become stronger readers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8673)|
| 2:24:37| and have taught them the importance of voting and how their voice has power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| There are a ton of improvements that need to be done in Knox County's school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8681)|
| 2:24:47| And I really do not understand why we're focusing on not promoting reading and helping this program to help our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8687)|
| 2:24:55| And in closing, I would like to encourage anyone on the board that has not volunteered to Freedom School to visit Freedom School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8695)|
| 2:25:03| Do it real loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| I do it every year, and it's one of the most rewarding ways that I spend one of my vacation days on every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8704)|
| 2:25:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| Candice Halpert. Candice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8715)|
| 2:25:23| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| Good evening. I'm Candice Halpert. I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| This is my son, Amir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| He is a Freedom School student, and he is looking forward to attending Freedom School this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8731)|
| 2:25:38| I am going to read some letters from parents that could not attend tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| So here's the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| I ask that KCS please vote yes to the MOU that will allow East Tennessee Freedom Schools to have access to bus transportation for its scholars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8744)|
| 2:25:53| A service that is already being provided at the KCS locations that ETFS has held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8753)|
| 2:26:00| East Tennessee Freedom Schools program helps a lot of the kids in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| From a personal perspective, this will be my child's third year attending East Tennessee Freedom Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8765)|
| 2:26:11| and this program has made such an impact on his life regarding him finding a love for reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| which he did not have before due to his struggles with reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| It has also helped with his self-confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8780)|
| 2:26:23| He even takes the things he has learned from East Tennessee Freedom Schools and share with his classmates in regular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8783)|
| 2:26:30| My child has said several times he would rather go to East Tennessee Freedom School instead of regular KCS, and that says a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8790)|
| 2:26:38| As a parent, I know that transportation to the program through the bus system of KCS will help a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| and I would not have to be late for work every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| This service is already being provided to these schools and will not cost KCS a dime to add a few more kids to the bus route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8806)|
| 2:26:54| And in all honesty, riding a bus to a summer program has nothing to do with the curriculum that ETFS uses that some may not personally approve of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8814)|
| 2:27:06| My daughter, Amaya, has attended Freedom Schools since she was in the seventh grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8826)|
| 2:27:13| I learned about this program and wanted to give it a shot, especially since it's focused on things like reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8833)|
| 2:27:19| since my daughter was in special education and behind on things such as comprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| Also, she was very shy around others, and I wanted her to be around other kids she didn't know to pull the shyness out of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8844)|
| 2:27:32| After attending the program, I saw results such as her wanting to read books after bringing home books from the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8852)|
| 2:27:39| She was also more talkative, and it showed at the program, but also teachers recognized it at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8859)|
| 2:27:46| I am so grateful for this program. It is a success story for every child who has participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8866)|

| 2:27:55| My son has been going to Freedom School for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| As a Knox County school student, he goes to a predominantly white school as a mixed-race student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8880)|
| 2:28:05| and has expressed feelings of being an outsider and unlike other students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| He finally has a great group of friends in his school, but I am so grateful for Freedom Schools for helping him along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8889)|
| 2:28:16| Freedom School brings a unique model that allows for diversity, inclusivity, and camaraderie that my son would not otherwise have known or learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8896)|
| 2:28:26| From the morning welcome chance to Ms. Denise's passionate dedication to each and every student in the program, I never cease to be impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8906)|
| 2:28:35| This is from Amy Helmendott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| Dionne Moten. Did I pronounce your name correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| Dionne Moten. Did I pronounce that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8924)|
| 2:28:54| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| Are there more people out in the other room maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| Dionne Moten? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8939)|
| 2:29:05| Okay. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| Okay. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| Keith Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8953)|
| 2:29:18| And we will have to vote on you as speaker since you live out of county, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8958)|
| 2:29:24| I will make a motion to approve this speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8964)|
| 2:29:27| I will second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| All right. So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| Please excuse my casual dress. I hope to make it to a soccer game, but that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| I'm Dr. Keith Bailey, the professional community development director at Harmony Family Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| Though I don't live in Knox County, I've worked with children from Knoxville through the child welfare system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8986)|
| 2:29:52| and through other services for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| I come from a unique perspective in that I and my colleagues have trained staff in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=8995)|
| 2:30:01| trained East Tennessee Freedom School staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| and trained about 1,400 of the National Freedom School's leadership and volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9004)|
| 2:30:10| on creating safe and trauma-responsive educational settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| I was troubled by the debate that ensued on Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9014)|
| 2:30:17| over a simple and seemingly positive MOU between the Freedom Schools and KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9017)|
| 2:30:24| I was troubled by disparaging comments and arguments made against Freedom Schools that merit some pushback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9024)|
| 2:30:31| There was a vague argument mounted against this MOU that disparaged Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9031)|
| 2:30:36| by stating that it had a strong alternative agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| without explicitly stating what that agenda was and what it was an alternative to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| And the incendiary word indoctrination was used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| There was also a more sensitive concern expressed that hearing different perspectives on history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9049)|
| 2:30:55| could cause confusion among students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| To address the latter of these two items, the irony is that looking at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| and considering them from different perspectives and experience is actually the antidote to indoctrination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9062)|
| 2:31:09| Indoctrination demands looking at things from only one perspective and doing so without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9069)|
| 2:31:15| Looking at different perspectives, including those of history and lived experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| creates what is called in the field of pedagogy and therapeutics cognitive dissonance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| which is actually a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| because it causes us to look at the difference between two experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| and start to be curious about them, to analyze them, to see the merits and shortcomings of both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| and to make an educated choice on what to do with the differing information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| It leads to a higher order of thinking and emotional growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9102)|
| 2:31:46| And when children and youth have this experience of considering multiple perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| that is guided by parents, caregivers, communities, reputable programs, and LEAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9111)|
| 2:31:58| it is the best case scenario for both social and formal education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9118)|
| 2:32:03| And what troubled me most in this debate was wanting to question the integrity of an agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9123)|
| 2:32:10| without looking at what they are doing right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| Let me give you a short list that follows Maslow's hierarchy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| They feed kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| They allow them to move and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| They give them a safe place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| They provide children with positive, nurturing community of peers, mentors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9142)|
| 2:32:29| community leaders of all colors and backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| They teach them to read, and they teach appropriate civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| On a procedural issue, if you find that your personal morality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| and the ethics of your role on this board conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| the best possible thing to do is to abstain from voting rather than push your morality by way of vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| Kent Minault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| Kent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9177)|
| 2:33:08| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| Good evening, board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| I'm Kent Minault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9192)|
| 2:33:13| I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9193)|
| 2:33:17| I'm addressing you tonight on behalf of the local Sierra Club group here, the Harvey Broom Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9197)|
| 2:33:24| We're the local branch of a national organization with a strong interest in racial and social justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9204)|
| 2:33:29| which we believe to be essential components of environmental sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9209)|
| 2:33:34| We have 2,000 members and supporters in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| and we're asking you to vote for the MOU and the data sharing with Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9217)|
| 2:33:43| Now, participants in Freedom Schools' program are roughly 80 percent black and overwhelmingly low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9223)|
| 2:33:50| Now, I'm a professional public school teacher, and I've taught literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9230)|
| 2:33:56| Here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| Folks in economic distress need all the help they can to get to progress economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9238)|
| 2:34:03| and language skills are at the top of the list of necessary tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9243)|
| 2:34:08| My decades of experience as a public school teacher taught me that every academic discipline, including math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9248)|
| 2:34:15| relies on language skills for the transmission of learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| Making sure these skills are learned at an early age is key to helping low income populations move into prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9259)|
| 2:34:28| Now, please reject claims that curriculum materials have some political agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9268)|
| 2:34:34| The program really has no other agenda than giving participants a leg up in the learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9274)|
| 2:34:40| Since the program is free to participating families and is supported by donations and grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9280)|
| 2:34:45| the district occurs no financial burden but gains a huge benefit in educational outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9285)|
| 2:34:53| Even the cost of the bus rides to program facilities, only two weeks of that does this district pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9293)|
| 2:35:00| beyond what it would normally pay for their own students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| The huge advantage of this program comes from the wide support it enjoys in its own communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9304)|
| 2:35:11| Much of it comes from a group of pastors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| The best way to keep students reading is to give them books they want to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9313)|
| 2:35:17| Please support parent choice, student enthusiasm, and kids hitting the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9317)|
| 2:35:24| Vote yes for the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| Thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9328)|
| 2:35:30| Constance Everly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| Constance, state your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| My name is Constance Everly, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| I live on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| Let me say the elephant in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| First off, this council is lacking comprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| 38% of the United States adult population is illiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| When I talk about literacy, I'm talking about your ability to read a sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| I'm talking about your ability to read a sentence plus comprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| You lack it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| More importantly, let's say the real elephant in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| This is not about freedom schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| This is about what Tennessee's struggle has always been culturally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| Racism and white supremacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| Because when we talk about doing something for the black kids, the same black kids we say stop shooting yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9374)|
| 2:36:21| The same black kids that live in a 47% poverty rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| The same black kids that Anthony Thompson Jr. was murdered in the black high school because he lived in the black neighborhood where several of his classmates had already been murdered due to the gun violence in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9384)|
| 2:36:34| And now we're talking about youth enrichment, which these same black kids lack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9394)|
| 2:36:38| Because if you want to go to jump jam, you got to go west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| You want to go bowling, you got to go west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| You want to do main event, you got to go west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| And this is something actually directly involved in our community that is strictly nothing more than youth enrichment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9404)|
| 2:36:50| And you have used racism, white supremacy, and the state legislator, the same state legislator that kicked black men out for standing up for children who are scared of being murdered by mass murderers in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9410)|
| 2:37:02| The same state legislator that we have Cameron Sexton, who doesn't live in his district, has wrongfully taken his seat in the first place in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9422)|
| 2:37:09| The same Cameron Sexton who has used taxpayers' dollars through per diem for his extra fair merits and misappropriation of tax dollars is who you bring here as a moral standard code of recommendation on what we should be doing in curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9429)|
| 2:37:24| Are y'all being serious right now in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9444)|
| 2:37:27| I have to echo Jennifer Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| It is stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9449)|
| 2:37:30| Absolutely stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| And it has no purpose other than you all finding ways to deflect and find reasons to continue to deny our communities and our children the necessary resources for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9451)|
| 2:37:41| This is why Knoxville College is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| It is an essential piece of our community that is missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| And I feel like if we had that, we would have other avenues and other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| Let me wrap it up because I only got 60 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| I'm going to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| Black people in this room, leverage your relationships because they're going to say no to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9474)|
| 2:37:59| So this is why we call Randy Boyd now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| I say, Randy, we need some money for these school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| We need some resources to help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| Since you're taking our back land and building up your infrastructure, we're going to need some assistance right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| Y'all ain't taking pictures for Indy and Ken and all these other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| Y'all need to call Indy up because let's not forget, the city has city schools and a memorandum agreement, too, and we transfer money back and forth, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| So, taxpayers, you're actually already paying for literally what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| But more importantly, Knoxville, this is why I am running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| Because if I was mayor right now in Knoxville, we wouldn't be going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| You could have came and asked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| Jessica Holman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| Jessica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9520)|
| 2:38:47| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9527)|
| 2:38:48| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| Just state your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9529)|
| 2:38:52| Okay, my name is Jessica Holman, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9532)|
| 2:38:56| I'm one of your principals in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| I'm the principal of Green Magnet STEAM Academy, which is in Region 5, the best region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9538)|
| 2:39:03| And I am also the principal of the first and only state STEM-designated school in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9543)|
| 2:39:11| So I'm here today, of course, speaking in favor of this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9551)|
| 2:39:15| And I heard the word choice a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| And I have, by choice, as a principal, agreed to host Freedom Schools in my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9557)|
| 2:39:22| Freedom Schools is a parent choice program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| So simply, if parents disagree with it, they don't have to send their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| There has never been any parent concerns with the way the program runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| In fact, the community and the parents love it and get a lot out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| Freedom Schools, in my opinion, from what I have seen and experienced personally, is good for all kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9577)|
| 2:39:43| But in particular, underserved students in the community who are in need of a safe, structured summer program that's focused on reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9583)|
| 2:39:51| To not continue this contract would completely ignore the needs and desires of my school community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9591)|
| 2:39:57| As an instructional leader, I know from best practice research that reading really is rocket science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9597)|
| 2:40:04| Students who are reluctant to read or read below grade level begin to grow and perform better in reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9604)|
| 2:40:10| when they can connect their own experiences to the material in a meaningful and authentic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9610)|
| 2:40:16| This is a high-quality academic program intentionally designed to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9616)|
| 2:40:22| I've seen it myself, and I only want the best for my kids at Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| And I would not have them in my school if I did not think they were the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| So lastly, please help the children in my community meet the district's ambitious literacy goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9629)|
| 2:40:36| Do the right thing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| Vote yes on the MOU with Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9642)|
| 2:40:43| Becky Hoffseth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| Becky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| Is Becky here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9653)|
| 2:40:54| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9654)|
| 2:40:55| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9655)|
| 2:40:56| I am the mother of seven, grandmother to 10, educator for 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| And I actually had a written script before I came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| I've listened, and I've learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| And I just really want to affirm the whole endeavor to make children literate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9671)|
| 2:41:19| And I commend it, but I have concerns about this particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| And I would actually love to have some conversations with, I think it was Misty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9685)|
| 2:41:30| Maybe we could talk afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| Because, I mean, it's just been a beautiful thing to hear how much this has helped children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9692)|
| 2:41:39| And yet there's an element of it that I actually went to the website that should we raise red flags, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9699)|
| 2:41:48| for any of us who actually are concerned about the direction that we're heading, where children are being subject to lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9708)|
| 2:42:02| Meaning that they could actually be a boy when they were born a girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9722)|
| 2:42:11| And so I'm a little confused, and I'd like to understand why is it that on the website it actually references books like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9731)|
| 2:42:23| I mean, it's like if it's not in the curriculum, then why do they reference it on their website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9743)|
| 2:42:31| So there's a book called Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| It's for young readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9753)|
| 2:42:34| It says when people look at Melissa, they think they see a boy named George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| But she knows she's not a boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9758)|
| 2:42:39| She knows she's a girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| On that book list, from the book I Am Jazz, from the time she was two years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9761)|
| 2:42:48| Jazz knew that she had a girl's brain and a boy's body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| She looked pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn't feel like herself in boys' clothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9772)|
| 2:42:57| This confused her family until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9777)|
| 2:43:07| So I don't know if in the room we all actually align with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9787)|
| 2:43:12| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| So those of us who are speaking up and do have concerns and are pushing back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9794)|
| 2:43:21| I like to think of this as defenders of youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9801)|
| 2:43:26| as well as upholders of the sacred role of parents to choose whether and when their child would be exposed to what is in truth a violation of humanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9806)|
| 2:43:37| a violation of science, and certainly a violation of the word and the will of God Almighty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9817)|
| 2:43:45| So if we move forward on this, can we really truly address the elephant in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9825)|
| 2:43:54| Do we want our children learning this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| Give them all sorts of great books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| There are so many out there, but get that out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9839)|
| 2:44:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| David Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| My name is David Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9856)|
| 2:44:19| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9859)|
| 2:44:20| I have two grandchildren in Knox County schools, one at Byne and one at Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9860)|
| 2:44:27| And I'm the current president of Town Hall East, which is a neighborhood organization in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9867)|
| 2:44:36| And I'm speaking on behalf of myself and our board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9876)|
| 2:44:41| At the beginning of the discussion, I thought I would have to scrap these few remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9881)|
| 2:44:47| because we were getting into technicalities, but I think we've gotten back to the nub of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9887)|
| 2:44:56| We think it's cruel beyond our understanding to sacrifice the well-being of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9896)|
| 2:45:03| for what amounts to an almost meaningless ideological squabble among adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9903)|
| 2:45:10| The children are in need of the services, the educational support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9910)|
| 2:45:16| and the material benefits that are provided by the East Tennessee Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9916)|
| 2:45:22| The program has proved itself over the years, and it deserves your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9922)|
| 2:45:30| A word about our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| We are celebrating our 52nd year as a chartered community organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9932)|
| 2:45:39| We have African-American board members and officers and members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9939)|
| 2:45:47| but we are not a predominantly black organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9947)|
| 2:45:52| We are, however, East Knoxvillians, and we are delighted and proud to have such a program in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9952)|
| 2:46:02| and we would urge you to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| It sounds like you're in rather uncharted territory to some degree legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9965)|
| 2:46:11| and what better way to explore those uncharted waters than with this type of a very strong, proven program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9971)|
| 2:46:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| Thank you, sir. Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9986)|
| 2:46:38| My name is Sherry Garrett, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| First off, the biggest concern, East Tennessee Freedom Schools, as Ms. Steen stated on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10003)|
| 2:46:50| is a franchise of Children's Defense Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| When you look at the Children's Defense Fund website, you see a lot of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| There's a lot of activism on that particular website, a lot of concerns, books, and videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10018)|
| 2:47:04| One of the videos that I watched, as a matter of fact, earlier today, was a Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10024)|
| 2:47:12| It was in another state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| However, it was a child who was doing a presentation on climate change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10034)|
| 2:47:18| and the presentation ended with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| if we do all of this, the apocalypse won't happen and we won't die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10041)|
| 2:47:26| That was what they're teaching these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10046)|
| 2:47:36| We've been talking about the formal agreement, the MOU, and the law that's in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10056)|
| 2:47:42| Any formal agreement right now, any formal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10062)|
| 2:47:46| may jeopardize state funding because of their teaching of these prohibited concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10066)|
| 2:47:51| That's on the Children's Defense Fund website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| As I said, East Tennessee Freedom Schools and all Freedom Schools across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10074)|
| 2:47:58| are franchises of this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| It is because of their teaching of these prohibited concepts, which is why it may be jeopardized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10081)|
| 2:48:08| Their booklets and online videos prove that they do teach these concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10088)|
| 2:48:13| Knox County Schools has no control over the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10093)|
| 2:48:17| but any formal agreement can harm Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| Teaching prohibited concepts, as we know, violates state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10101)|
| 2:48:25| And after speaking with state legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| Chairman John Reagan, who authored the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| is standing ready right now to take action if you choose to pass this Memorandum of Understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10112)|
| 2:48:38| Any formal agreement with this organization implies endorsement from Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10118)|
| 2:48:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10131)|
| 2:49:00| Kevin Hill, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| Well, I may be about to burn a bridge or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10145)|
| 2:49:09| but I agree with the previous lady who mentioned that she's come and she's learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10149)|
| 2:49:16| and she's seen some beautiful things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10156)|
| 2:49:19| And I believe in divine appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| When I walked in tonight, the pastor who had one of the largest influences on my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10161)|
| 2:49:27| in growing in Christ and seeking intimacy with God was standing in the back of the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10167)|
| 2:49:32| and we chatted and caught up for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| And then we both had to exit to the overflow room where we encountered other people from the group here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10174)|
| 2:49:40| that are supportive of freedom schools that he had relationship with and was interacting with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10180)|
| 2:49:45| And so I had the chance to communicate with some of those parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10185)|
| 2:49:48| and get some of the questions that we've collectively had answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| And one of the conclusions I've come to is, you know, it's one of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10192)|
| 2:49:57| fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10197)|
| 2:50:03| This may be one of those instances where I have to adopt that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| But everything I've heard and seen tonight about the local expression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10207)|
| 2:50:12| and I'm being very clear and I agree with the concerns about the franchise relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10212)|
| 2:50:17| but the local expression says these are good and righteous people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10217)|
| 2:50:22| who are doing a good and righteous thing with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| And I mean, I just sat a four-hour test on con law and I had to write about Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10225)|
| 2:50:33| And I'm telling you, I'm not going to be the white guy that tells a black kid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| they don't have access to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| I'm not going to be that guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| Now, next year when I stand at this podium and all the laundry lists are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10242)|
| 2:50:47| I'm going to hold people's feet to the fire for lying to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10247)|
| 2:50:52| But I'm sure as heck not going to be the guy that stands up and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10252)|
| 2:50:55| and it's not fear out of some great historical fear, that's some racist memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10255)|
| 2:51:02| You know where this fear we're encountering right now is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| So we've got to give each other a lot of grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| It's called PTSD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| We just went through three years of crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| And we're all hurting real bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| We're all real upset and everybody's raw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| And that's what the people who are concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| it's not because they don't want a black kid to have access to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| It's because we collectively as a community are suffering PTSD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10287)|
| 2:51:33| and we've got to love each other through recovery from that trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10293)|
| 2:51:38| And so if me, from my political perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10298)|
| 2:51:42| can be part of reaching across the aisle and shaking a hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| to make that recovery happen by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| take a risk, you already fought one lawsuit over frivolous crap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10308)|
| 2:51:53| fight another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| And that is not what I planned to say when I came here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10318)|
| 2:51:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum for this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10324)|
| 2:52:13| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10333)|
| 2:52:25| Well, we have a motion on the floor so we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10345)|
| 2:52:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10347)|
| 2:52:28| We'll take a break after this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10350)|
| 2:52:31| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10351)|
| 2:52:32| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10354)|
| 2:52:35| I appreciate all the public forum speakers that came and shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| Thank you for taking the time and listening to us first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| I know normally we want to listen to you first, so thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10361)|
| 2:52:45| I would like to offer a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10365)|
| 2:52:48| That substitute motion would be for us to split the two issues apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| for us to both vote on data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10372)|
| 2:52:54| and then have a subsequent vote on transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| I believe that the law department can help us navigate that in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10377)|
| 2:53:02| splitting those apart, so I would like to offer that we vote on each issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10382)|
| 2:53:06| separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10387)|
| 2:53:11| So you are officially making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10391)|
| 2:53:17| I'm making a motion to split the two issues, data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10397)|
| 2:53:21| and transportation, and have them voted on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10404)|
| 2:53:25| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| If I second the motion and if the motion passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10408)|
| 2:53:33| would we then be able to take a break and come back and vote on each one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10413)|
| 2:53:37| That's a great question, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10417)|
| 2:53:38| I like that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10418)|
| 2:53:42| Mr. Goopler, that would be a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10422)|
| 2:53:47| Well, there's already a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| and now you're asking for a substitute motion in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10429)|
| 2:53:54| So if the substitute motion passed, that would do away with the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10434)|
| 2:53:59| and we would come back to vote on two new motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10439)|
| 2:54:02| Right, if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| Yeah, if the substitute motion passes, then it does away with the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10444)|
| 2:54:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| Reverend Butler, would you like to speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| or just take that vote and come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10454)|
| 2:54:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10457)|
| 2:54:18| We have a substitute motion on the floor to split the MOU into two separate items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10458)|
| 2:54:24| One would be the data sharing and the other one would be the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10464)|
| 2:54:27| Let me provide clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10467)|
| 2:54:28| Should they both pass, I don't want to force the district to have two separate MOUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10468)|
| 2:54:33| I just want to vote on the two elements separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| So you're voting on keeping those items in the MOU, or I guess if one passes, it stays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10475)|
| 2:54:40| In terms of its final form, in the final form it would be one MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10480)|
| 2:54:44| I want us to vote on the issues separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| Right, that makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230505?start=10486)|
