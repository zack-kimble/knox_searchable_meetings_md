| 0:00:26| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=26)|
| 0:00:28| We have six members present. That is a quorum, so we will get underway with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| Our next item is the amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=33)|
| 0:00:36| Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=36)|
| 0:00:38| I'd like to begin by saying I would like to withdraw number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| I had put that on the agenda for information purposes for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| None of the commissioners have indicated that they would like to make a change in that policy, so I'm going to ask that that be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=46)|
| 0:00:52| Number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| Are there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| Which one is that in regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| I've got it spread out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| It's the employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| It's the employee handbook, number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| It was about the employee handbook for the commissioners or the commission employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| Yes, Mr. Van Vaten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| If we could, we would like to withdraw item 45, closure of Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| We have an engineering solution that we think will mitigate the speed but enable us to keep the road open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Number 37, R-11-9-805.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| There was a series of motions pending before the court, and those will not be heard until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| It would be premature to review this matter during this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| and I respectfully request you continue this until we get a ruling from the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| Table it until next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Or January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| I suspicion the court will expedite it, but in the event I may come back next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| I just don't want to do it to you indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| So this will be on the agenda for October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| Any other items to be added or withdrawn or anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=127)|
| 0:02:16| If not, do I hear a motion that all those things to be added be added and all those things withdrawn be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| I need someone to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| It is so done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| I have the next is the approval of the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| Is there a motion for that approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| It is ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| We have a consent agenda that I would like to ask that you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| And if you want to pull anything from that, please feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| We need to get plugged in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=176)|
| 0:03:20| We are ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Number 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=201)|
| 0:03:50| 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 35, 41,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=230)|
| 0:04:19| 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=259)|
| 0:04:28| Does any commissioner wish to withdraw any of those for consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| I don't have the numerical list that I had online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| It's 404, which is what number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Is 19 on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Can I pull 404, 405, 406?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=296)|
| 0:05:09| Any others to be pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| No, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| So that will be items 19, 20, and 21, 405, 405.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| You said 404, 405, 406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| Any others to be pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Do I hear a motion that we approve this consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Motion to approve the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| I would like to move to the beginning of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| the discussion with regards to the time limits for speakers during the commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| Each of you have indicated to me that you would like to have a better means of monitoring the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| that speakers are speaking, both commissioners and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| What we have done is Mr. John Gustin has provided us with a timer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| and so we will be posting the timer when we have people speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| either from the public or commissioners speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| so that you can see on the screen how much time you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Our rules say five minutes with subsequent three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| So you have asked me to better police that, and so we're going to start doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| and I think this will be a good test today to see how well it will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| So, Jolie, would you put up on the screen exactly what it will look like with the five-minute timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| And so when someone starts speaking, she will hit start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| and everyone speaking will know how much time they have and how much time is left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| and I will be stopping you at the end of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| Of course, any commissioner can allow someone to have additional time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| So, without any objection, we will try that today and see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| I just wanted to wish Ms. Broyles, if she's watching from home, speedy recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| I know you may want to mention something a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| Yes, I talked with her over the weekend, and she said she was doing well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| and that she had hoped to be here today but was not able to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| She's hopeful that she will be here on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| But, yes, Amy, I know you're watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Please know that we're praying and thinking about you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| and looking forward to having you back with us on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| On page one, item number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee reappointing Marcus Chatty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| and reappointing for District 4, District 6, and District 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| to the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals, Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Motion to send on with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| I was going to ask, do you have a recommendation in District 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| Could you tell us who that might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| William Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Anything from District 6 yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Today, so far, it will be Larry York, the reappointment of Larry York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| I'll have to confirm with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Larry York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| And District 8, Mr. Wright's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| He's in the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| So the motion is to send it on without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| but we will add a name from the 8th District for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| But Mr. Daniels will be in District 4 and Larry York, District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and we'll get the name for District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| So is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=479)|

| 0:08:23| I just had some questions about this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| for someone from the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| Robin Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| I'm with the Development Corporation, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you, Robin, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| How many members are there on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| There are 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| I really haven't had time to research the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| and really determine for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| I mean, for me, you know how, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| I've had some controversy ongoing with the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| and some of their approach to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| And I'm just curious about the board and its balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| I mean, I'm aware of who Mr. Spezia or however you say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| Spezia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Spezia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| But I do have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| And so I'm going to do that between now and the big meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| I'll have some more questions about the composition of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| And I'm just wondering about is the board heterogeneous enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| You know, is there variety on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| I know Mr. Spezia is representing a very large business interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=591)|
| 0:09:59| in the form of Park West and Covenant Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| But I'm just curious about some other activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| So I'm going to make a motion that we move this without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| And then I'd like to ask some questions next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| We'll be more than happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| And that's my motion, move it without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| As a substitute, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| One opposed to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| So it will be heard next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=631)|

| 0:11:03| If not, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=663)|

| 0:11:06| Pardon me, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| What are the terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| I mean, is this big raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| Is this the same salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| Do we have someone from the schools that would like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| Mr. McIntyre, that's coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| I'm the superintendent of schools, 912 South Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you, Commissioner and Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| The contract that I have with the Board of Education actually contemplates a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| salary increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| but I'm going to forego that salary increase for this upcoming contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| that's been approved by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| Some of this information doesn't always get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Some of this information doesn't always get out to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| even though it might be on our back windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| That's a reasonable one to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Dr. McIntyre, that's first class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| That's true leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| I know your teachers hadn't had raises and stuff out there like what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| wanted to, but I appreciate you taking the lead on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| So I think we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=728)|

| 0:12:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=734)|
| 0:12:25| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| approving covenants for permanent maintenance of stormwater facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| and best management practices with Gallaher Overholt Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| LLC, for property located at 7560 Daner Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Nineteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Do we have someone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Dwight, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Commissioner Mr. Granger is here as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| but he's gone out to get some of the detail on these two because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| normally handled by Eddie Roberts in stormwater management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| You know, I'm just asking my normal set of questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| They are all in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| Gallaher is the larger site of the two, obviously, since it's the Mercy North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| Well, it's been renamed, but it was the Mercy North site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| And the other site, I believe, is the physician's office out east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Should we wait until he gets back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| He's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| He's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=806)|
| 0:13:34| He wasn't here last month, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| so he may not be familiar with your specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| He knows me pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| Chris, just about the site and, you know, what are we dealing with site-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| I was not able to get into the background on the net on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| so I'm just always curious about stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| potential stormwater issues for you and for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Unfortunately, I was outside the door, so I'm not sure which item you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| We're on 404, which is item 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| Danaher Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| That's basically it's an addition or a retrofit to an existing site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| And there's some, I guess, paved area added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| and so stormwater management controls are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| And so the easement or the maintenance covenants are recorded to reflect that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| How large of an expansion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| I do not know the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| It's parking lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| So it's a medical office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| In fact, both of the maintenance covenants on the agenda are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| So you don't see problems here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| These are fairly simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| So within, you know, when I'm trying to do the, you know, my study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=913)|

| 0:15:33| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=933)|

| 0:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Same set of questions there, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| I don't have the background on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| I just want to know, or Dwight, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| What's the site like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| As I recall, this is a doctor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| This is a much smaller site than Danaher, and Mr. Roberts tells us that everything is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Item 21 is resolution 406, approving a master services agreement and scope of services in the amount of $87,600| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| with AMEC, Earth and Environmental, Inc., for consulting services related to the stormwater management plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| and water quality scores card as required for Knox County to meet EPA permit requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Chris, could you comment on the necessity of AMEC for this scorecard process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| This is the majority of the work that's in this scope that this contract reflects is what's being recommended by the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=998)|
| 0:16:48| called by County Commission to look at the stormwater program and the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| So one of the recommendations was to go ahead and do the water quality scorecard, which is, in fact, an EPA requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| to go ahead and do it rather swiftly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| And in addition to develop a stormwater management plan, which is the other part of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| which is also a requirement under the EPA contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| So it's very much in keeping with the recommendations from the stormwater committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| But why AMEC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Why do we need to spend this money on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| As opposed to doing it ourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| Well, I think there's a certain amount of expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| and a certain perspective of having gone through similar experiences doing the water quality scorecard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1056)|
| 0:17:47| developing the stormwater management plan with other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| and actually doing the process can be rather resource intensive for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| And it really, it's not just a stormwater project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| It's something to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| It's something that looks at all aspects of the development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| and how they relate to our EPA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| So a little skeletal outline of what you think AMEC is going to provide you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| What we'll be provided with is obviously the facilitation for the work sessions, developing the scorecard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1093)|
| 0:18:22| it's actually a process of scoring and evaluating the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| And the same with developing the stormwater management plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| and then in the end an actual document with a scorecard and evaluation of Knox County's stormwater program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| as it relates to water quality, stormwater management plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| It also includes a monitoring plan for stream quality monitoring in the watersheds in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1124)|
| 0:18:53| And from that also recommendations for specific areas to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| Has AMEC done this for another county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| So they've got experience with the scorecard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| And helping the county adapt to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| And they are familiar with the way every municipality or city or county has a slightly different way of converging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1154)|
| 0:19:24| with all the services they offer to address stormwater permit issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| And they do have the advantage, I suppose, of being familiar with the way that works in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Clock's ticking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| I'm going to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Motion's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| I'd like to record reflect that Commissioners Wright and Shouse have joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| They were in the audit committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| That's why they're running a tad late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| But just for their information, you've asked me to ride herd on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| And so we have a clock that we're having on your screens just for your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| just so you can see how things are going and how much time that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Yes, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| We've been about county business since before nine o'clock this morning with light lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| And we finally broke the chains of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| At some point in time, I'd like to ask to revisit item number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| Not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Let's go ahead and do that now because we've added William Daniels' name for District 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| Larry York for District 6, and I had mentioned that you would-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Currently serving and is eligible for another term and has been doing an excellent job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| and would like to be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| This was sent on without recommendation, but we'll add that name so that it will be considered on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| The next item is on page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| It's item number 29, resolution 602.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| It's approving the year two notice of grant award in the amount of $602,846| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Adolescent Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| for promoting safer sex in Tennessee, the PSST project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| First of all, Dr. Buchanan, is this a women's health grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| Will it affect salaries or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| Martha Buchanan, Director of Knox County Health Department, 140 Damron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| This is not a women's health grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| This is a totally separate grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| I was just going to abstain if it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Next item, page seven, item number 33, resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| It's approving contract with Public Financial Management, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Morgan Keegan and Company, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| and BB&T Capital Markets Division of Scott and Stringfellow LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| for financial advisory services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Yes, I wanted, John, to just explain a little bit what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Morgan Keegan, formerly Cherokee Securities, I guess, still is our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| that's who we use primarily for bond underwriting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| PFM is who we contracted with several months ago to give us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| phone book size debt analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| And then just elaborate on those, if you wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Tell us what BB&T would be doing here, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Yeah, one of the things that the mayor wanted to do is just put the debt team out for competitive proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| And also on your agenda was the bond council, which was on consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| and financial advisory services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| It's an area that's very important to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| What your proposal is is that Morgan Keegan, Cumberland Securities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| would be our lead financial advisor for taking Knox County bonds to the bond market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| and giving our primary debt advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| PFM would serve the role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| They gave a report to the county commission last year, I hope you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| and gave some independent advice on our debt position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| and some several steps to improve our debt position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| And the mayor would like to continue to have that second opinion from PFM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| and I think that's very healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| BB&T currently serves as a letter of credit for three of our issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| and we are going to use their expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| because we've got two other letters of credit that we need to replace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| not the BB&T ones, but we need to replace with another bank in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| And BB&T would provide just the expertise and not the sales for enhancing the letter of credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1417)|
| 0:23:46| from Depfa Bank is who it is, and that agreement will expire in the new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| and they're not in that business anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| And BB&T would not necessarily issue those additional letters of credit, though, would they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Right, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| We're getting independent advice on the best letter of credit we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| without them issuing the letter of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| And so I think it's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| It's healthy to have the second opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| and I think that would be the best mix as far as a debt team to proceed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| I'm on the board at BB&T, so I need to recuse myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| but I've got four minutes and 30 seconds to tell you what a good bank BB&T is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| and I'll just recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| If not, the motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1474)|

| 0:24:50| and the Energy Efficient Schools Council to fund certain energy management improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| for the Knox County Board of Education to be paid through savings from said improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| I have a motion to approve just to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1501)|

| 0:25:06| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| John, is this the money for the train contract, or is this separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| The money for the train contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| It's not all of it, but it's the biggest piece of it, and it's 0.75% with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| John, we're getting updates from them, aren't we, as to the savings and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| How often do we get those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| We get them every month, and I think that might be good for a future topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| is to talk about how that's implementing and the opportunity we have in the future for savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| I'll make a note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1541)|

| 0:26:02| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Mr. Law Director, we keep extending this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| Why do we keep extending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| Well, sir, you're currently, there's litigation involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| You have two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| One, don't have a moratoria, and then you have no control over the placement of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| Or two, do a moratoria depending upon the outcome of the litigation or some kind of negotiated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1580)|
| 0:26:30| Do we have any idea when this will be decided or settled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| We're currently at the mercy of the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1594)|

| 0:27:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| I had just a quick question, I guess, for the, John, you might be able to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| The money, I know we've been right in a few gambling places and drug money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| Are we allowed to use that money to buy a new cruiser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| I know last year we bought some cruisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| What do you all do with that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| Right now we turn it into finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| We haven't done anything with that money right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| But I'll find out what we can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1656)|

| 0:27:43| Hey, Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| What equipment did we not buy and what are we buying this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| We had to buy 10 cages and we had to purchase 65 laptop mounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| Those were not purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| We ended up not spending $60,000 of that money you did give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1678)|

| 0:28:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| I really wanted to say I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| Since last year, there have been five items on the capital plan from school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1726)|
| 0:28:54| The only one that's still currently before us is the work at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| Some of the even larger projects and even the STEM academy have been completed or are currently in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1742)|
| 0:29:10| We worked through several issues of need and funding over the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| and sort of a final plan has come to us from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| As some of the members of the Board of Education have said, this has taken long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| They voted to accept a new school at Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| and there are three things that are involved in this resolution that deal with the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| getting that new school out at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| And they met last week and approved this plan, and I move for its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| Mayor Burchett, if you'd like to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Tim Burchett, County Mayor, 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| I want to introduce part of our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| This will be, I think, the lights at the end of the tunnel on the Carter project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| We're moving along, and I appreciate the commission's support to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| and hopefully we'll have it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| First, I want to introduce our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Notice I said very brief, since he's got a timer up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| Presentation, Mr. Mark Mamentoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| and then I'm going to ask the folks from Partners to come up and display what they've worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| and some things they've worked out, and I think you'll be very impressed with the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| We want to give you the time that you need, so if you go across the timer, don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| We want to give you the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| You never want to tell an attorney that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I was making the brief comment purely for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| So, Mr. Mamentoff, you really need to watch the timer now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| It's a very formidable timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| I'm Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| and I do have a little outline of a presentation, but please tell me if I'm giving you more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| Sometimes I know that I can get into my presentation a little bit more passionately than probably is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1854)|
| 0:31:02| When the mayor and John Troyer had asked me to help with this project early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| and asked me to how can we consider as many ways possible of financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| and structuring the development for a new Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| there were really two main goals that he gave me to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| One is let's look at different alternatives for financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| which there's a laundry list of various types of tax-exempt bonds and tax-credit bonds that you can look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| and also he asked me to look at ways we can look at alternative delivery methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| instead of the regular sort of public bidding method that is typically used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Not to say one is better than the other, but he felt it might be good to look at alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| So to be able to do that, he asked me, well, what method can we do to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| And I said, well, probably the best way to accomplish what you're trying to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| is to go through the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| The Industrial Development Board, as you all know, is a public body appointed by this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| and it has broad powers to undertake a large number of types of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| One type of project that it can undertake is any public building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| And the board has broad powers to lease projects to public entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| It also has broad powers to make loans to private entities and let them lease it back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| And so by using the Industrial Development Board to facilitate this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| we were trying to accomplish the most flexibility in terms of financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| and in particular we were considering lease financing at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| and some fairly obscure tax-exempt, tax-credit bonds we were looking at at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| And it also, the board has way more flexibility than essentially any other public entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| in using a turnkey development method where you pass on as much risk in the development process to a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| instead of bearing as much construction risk at the public bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| It also passed the borrowing risk during the construction period on to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| Right now with interest rates, particularly reinvestment rates so low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| if the county goes out and borrows money and reinvests the money during the construction period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| it suffers fairly significant negative arbitrage during the period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| So that helps address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| So we felt the IDB was the right way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| and obviously we've been to the IDB a couple of times and they've expressed their support for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| The IDB issued an RFP with the help of the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| and with the help of Hugh Holt and Tony Parker and the staff of the procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| the county's procurement office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| It's important to note this was an RFP for proposals, not a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| And the RFP specifically provided that it was a proposal to enter into negotiations for a development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2026)|
| 0:33:55| It was not like widgets where whoever the low bidder was would win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| It was a negotiation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| And the evaluation criteria were several-fold with the two most important being price, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| but also adherence to the school's program standards and providing the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| and the Board of Education what they were looking for in terms of a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| We asked for a number of various financing alternatives for them to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| so that the board could negotiate the best proposal, the best terms for the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| and hence for the county and the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| But in every one of the proposals, we had asked the proposing parties to provide a lump sum payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| so they could all be purchased at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| And so every one of the proposing parties did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| The RFP went out, and you really didn't even have to do an RFP through the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| but it was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| We got six responses, four parties were interviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| and all of the parties proposed a lump sum payment as one of the alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| And so we had that very valuable information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| A lot of folks have asked me about this process about why not use a lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| We looked very carefully at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| There were several types of lease agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| A true lease, for those of you familiar with it, where tax ownership would remain with a private party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| and they would get the depreciation for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| but then the school would have to pay a fair market value purchase at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| After evaluating that, neither the county nor the school folks felt that that was in the best interest of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| or the Board of Education, so that was not pursued further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| In the lease financing alternatives, the cost of capital was much higher than what the mayor decided to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| And so, as you know, what's before you now is to pay the development fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| or the purchase price from the county through various sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| through liquidation of some assets but also from other funds that are available to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| Mr. Mamentoff, your five minutes is up, but I'm going to let you continue because this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Okay. Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| I will try to speed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| So what you have before you today are three documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| One is the purchase agreement, which is the agreement between the county and the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| under which they would purchase the school upon completion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| the interlocal cooperation agreement between the IDB and the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| providing for the overall cooperation on the project and the memorandum of understanding with the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| Basically, that document, the county would agree to provide adequate funds to pay the IDB's expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| So I'm sorry I went over my five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| I tried to cut it quick toward the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I know there have been a lot of questions about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| It really was intended to be a very logical and orderly one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| but there had to have been some adaptations as we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Thank you, Mr. Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Before I start my questioning of maybe several people on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| it's the purpose of the questions in my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| and I'll make a motion to move this without recommendation in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| The purpose is primarily to allow the body to discuss and to investigate somewhat some of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2230)|
| 0:37:19| because the process got so really convoluted and curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| and we've never really delved into that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| and some of the problems with the school board or the administrative staff of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| I have absolutely no problem whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| and I would never have anyone that I could prefer over Mark Mametoff handling any financial arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2260)|
| 0:37:49| He is absolutely the most trustworthy person that I know of in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| and probably the most talented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| And why he stays in Knoxville to do this, I'm not really sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| but it's just because he's a great guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| So the other side of that is, or one other side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| is that Partners Development has been selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| and it was always so curious of why they weren't selected in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| They've only got experience with 100 schools or so in the building process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| So it was all, there's just a whole lot of questions that I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| and there's several of my colleagues that were probably in the forefront of that questioning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| when this came up the other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| So that's really all I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I just want them to have an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| and I want us to have an opportunity to do some vetting of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| This may be a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| The school may need to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| and the renovation be put to the side, all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| But I think that we need to have the opportunity to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| And so that's the reason why I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| So I'd like to make a motion to move it without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| As the substitute, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| First of all, Mr. Mamentoff, do you want to respond to anything Mr. Norman had to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| Other than he's beaten me at tennis so many times that he likes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| It's the basis for his nice comments, but other than that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| You mentioned three documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| We only have two here, and we got them five minutes before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| and it's kind of hard when you're trying to get ready for a meeting to read through these legalese| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| for us non-attorneys and decide who's on first and who's on second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| Just skimming through it, if I was just reading it, skimming through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| it looks like a shell game because one's selling it to another who's going to sell it to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| and the other's going to buy it back on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| Can somebody give us, in layman's terms, a step-by-step process on what is going to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| Yes, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| I'd be glad to attempt to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| The Industrial Development Board went into a development agreement with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| The developer would agree to construct the project for a fixed price by a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| That development agreement is not an agreement to which the county would be a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| It would be that agreement in which, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| the construction risk would occur in terms of making sure the project is completed on time and within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| If that does not occur and the project is not delivered to the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| the county is not required to purchase the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| That agreement, the development agreement, would be considered at the Industrial Development Board's meeting in early October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2440)|
| 0:40:48| The agreement, the purchase agreement, which you referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| I think you may have gotten a recent black-line version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| There was an earlier draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| We had a few comments from the developer because they were brought recently in the transaction, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| And that agreement is a fairly simple agreement which basically says that once the project is completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| and it's delivered in accordance with the development agreement and accepted by the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| and approved by the school board representatives and the county representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| then the county would purchase it for a fixed price from the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| Therefore, the county would not have the risk of having to deal with the construction issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| until it's completed, signed, sealed, and delivered to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| Then, once it goes to the county, obviously, school properties are really managed and controlled by the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| The intergovernmental agreement would provide for the school to be moved to the school board of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2496)|
| 0:41:44| where they would hold title to the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| And so that agreement is the agreement to which they've agreed, the school board agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| to commit $2.5 million of the capital funds of the $5 million of the other $2.5 million that was to be used for Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| was to be used for other renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| But they would commit $2.5 million toward the overall cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| I understand that hopefully in the end the school board is going to wind up with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2526)|
| 0:42:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Well, this says the county has conveyed to the IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| And we're going to sell it to IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Who's going to turn around and sell it to the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Who's going to sell it back to the IDB board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| And then we're going to come back from the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| and the county is going to buy it from them and give it to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| I mean, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Everything you said was accurate except for the one, two, three, fours, and fives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Step one, this particular piece of property on Straw Plains Pike is presently titled in the name of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| The school board has approved the transfer of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| but right now the legal title is the name of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| The county would deed the property over to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| The Industrial Development Board would never deed the property over to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| The developer would just essentially serve as a building on the property held by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2574)|
| 0:43:04| I'm right here somewhere, but I'm going to have to re-read this thing before next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I just so what we're saying is the IDB board is going to use that big cash of money to fund this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2590)|
| 0:43:18| that we had set aside for the Midway project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| That's one question I can't answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| They got more than $11 million it's going to take to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Yeah, we're not proposing to use any of the Midway money for this project, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| In other words, the IDB board has got a whole big deep pockets then, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| Well, there's the Industrial Development Board and then there's the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| The Development Corporation is the entity that holds the Midway money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| Well, we have to school the carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| We also need some help with some others around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| What I want to know is where the money is going to come from to pay for this thing two years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| when it's ready for a turnkey job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Yeah, the mayor has charged me to do this without additional debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| and certainly we've identified of a $13.8 million project, $10.5 million to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| and so we're 75 percent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| And none of this money will be due until the school is accepted by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| And so that's the way the contract is designed, is that the school has to be finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| finished in accordance with school standards and accepted by the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| and then the money would be due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| So we've got two years to come up with the remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| But where did the $10 million come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| I know where $2.1 came from, but where did the rest or the other $8 million come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| The school board's contribution is $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| That's on top of the $10.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| That brings it up to whatever to the $13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| 9-1-1 has agreed to pay its mortgage early to us, and that's been an unbudgeted receipt of $3.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2699)|
| 0:45:07| Solway land is $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| The city has repaid its share of the Young-Williams Animal Center, $943,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| The county has been the recipient of a one-time SEC settlement for $892,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| We've got an option for Marble Alley, some downtown properties that will be $771,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| which are expected to close in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Can we get a copy of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| I can do that as fast as you talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Can we get a copy of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| I'd be glad to share this with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| But it's $10.5 million, and none of this would be due until the school would be accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| So that's another year and a half, two years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| Yeah, that's another 3.3 to go with two years to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| I'm not interested in selling off any assets, any more assets to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| I think we were right in what we did with the waste property out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| But, you know, they're not making any more property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| And one of these days we're going to need some and not have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| But if you can get that list to us, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| I'd be glad to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Mr. Troyer, could you and Mr. Mamentoff join us at 11.30 next Monday for the chairman's lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| We'd be glad to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| If you could do that, I think it would be a good opportunity for us to really delve into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| And so we'll get you right up first thing at 11.30 Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Quick question for Attorney Mamentoff, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| In your five-minute explanation there, you mentioned negative arbitrage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| which I guess is the only kind we can earn anymore, isn't it, under IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Was that just under the hypothetical that we sold bonds for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| It was really under the hypothetical that if you had tried to do interim construction financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| even if we used either our own money or if we did interim construction financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| we would have a negative carry cost during the construction period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| which by them handling the construction financing we will not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Hypothetical then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| If and when we do go back into the bond market, we cannot earn true arbitrage anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| It depends on the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| There are certain types of transactions that if you meet certain spend down requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| you are able to keep any positive arbitrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Unfortunately, as you well know, it's very, very rare these days to be able to earn any sort of positive arbitrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| It's almost inherent in the market that you're going to lose money on any reinvestment during the construction period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| I'm like Commissioner Brown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Would you just get this information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Give me a scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| To cost the school, you estimate maybe $13 million, but it comes in at $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| Or is the county locked in that we only pay the $13 or do we pay the $16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| Same scenario, instead of $13, it's $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| Do we pay the lower amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Well, the price that was originally proposed by the bond group was $13.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| The partner's price, which is still being finalized, would not be in excess of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| It would be probably a little bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| In no event will this purchase agreement, it will have a precise amount in the purchase agreement that will not exceed that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| And the county will be under no obligation to pay more than what is in that purchase agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| So, in other words, if there were any changes that would result in any additional cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| they would have to go back to both the Industrial Development Board and to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| And we've tried to draft the documents in a manner to be very, so that any change orders would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| it would be very discouraged to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| We don't expect that to happen, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| So right now you're looking at $13.8 to build it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| At the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| That's the maximum amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| The motion on the floor is to send without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Anders, and Commissioner Wunbe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| So what is the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Mr. Law Director, the vote is 5-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| He's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| For clarification, the folks from Partners were here and they wanted, if that would be possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| Oh, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| And I don't want to, if it was the final vote, I'd just tell Partners to save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| The vote was 5-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| We did not have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| So, Mr. Jarrett, the vote was 5-3, so we did not have six in the affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| You should just probably pass this without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| That's what the motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| That's what the motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Oh, well, yes, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Let's go ahead with the presentation, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| The group from Partners, if they want to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| I would remind Mr. Chairman that you were inviting John Troyer and Mark Mamentoff to lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| and Mamentoff being a lawyer, he'll probably, you know, have to upgrade on your lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| So just bare notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| I'll make sure we get him the proper lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| And also, I'd like to invite the folks that are getting ready for the presentation to be present, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| just in case there are more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| And, sir, if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| Daryl Johnson, Johnson Architecture, 2240 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| I'm going to be very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| I promise I won't go over five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| I've got four key points that we want to make clear about the new design of the Carter School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| First of all, it's important to note that we've been working closely with Doug Dillingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| and the school board representatives to make sure that we meet the standards that have been set forth for the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3024)|
| 0:50:31| and in particular, looking at the systems that have evolved through the use of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| or for the development of the Gibbs and the Southwest schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| So we've been working closely with Doug and his group on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| The new school currently is at 89,300 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| It has 35 instructional classrooms with the further plans for expansion of another eight classrooms if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3049)|
| 0:50:58| The school at this point is designed for 600 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| with that expansion incorporating another 200 for 800 total upon full build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| We've proposed to provide energy-efficient systems within the school that will meet 35 KBTU energy standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| that have been set forth by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| In addition to energy-efficient building automation systems that will be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Again, similar to the models and the standards that have been set forth at Gibbs and at Southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| The site plan, which Mr. Parker is holding, allows for complete segregation of bus traffic and vehicular traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3087)|
| 0:51:36| It also allows for 70 plus cars to queue on site without being out on Straw Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3096)|
| 0:51:44| It has also segregated any interaction between vehicles and children so that playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| all the access to the school has been accommodated within the school property itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| without interfering with any of the bus or vehicular traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| The exterior is brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Again, meeting the standards, building envelope has been addressed with Mr. Dillingham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| and we're moving forward quite quickly with the development of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3127)|
| 0:52:16| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| A quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Go over the stats you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| Was it 8,900 square feet did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| Go over those first stats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| What do they have now and what are we going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| What's the current square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Maybe Doug may know or somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| I'm not sure what they currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| The current facility is 89,300 square feet with 35 instructional classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| I'm just curious as to how to compare that to what we've got currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| Anybody here from school that can answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| We can get that next week if you don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Here comes Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| Doug Dillingham, Knox County Schools Facilities and Construction, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3181)|
| 0:53:20| Commissioner, I don't recall exactly off the top of my head the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| Now, I do know that our planned addition renovation, once completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| we were taking the existing gymnasium that the middle school is now using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| and converting it for use at the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| With that, plus what we were planning on adding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| we were going to have approximately 70,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| So I would anticipate that the existing facility right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| is somewhere in the probably 40,000 to 45,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| And how many classrooms, Doug, do you have right now? Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I do not recall off the top of my head, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| If you could get that to us, I'd like to know where we are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| and what the renovation we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| You're saying it would go to 70,000, and this is looking at 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| So we compare all three stats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| I'd like to make a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Commissioner Wright, that motion failed on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| It's irrelevant how we, if somebody is against it, it's not going to be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| So the original motion is back on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Can we just make the original motion, change the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| since you made it to pass without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| It has no bearing on the vote Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| It's just, you know, do you understand where I'm at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| So your original motion is a second, agreeing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| Where is the second? Who did you have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| I didn't have any questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| I was wanting to ask, go ahead, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Before you guys go away, could you come back just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| Just wanted to know who the architect is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| I'm Darryl Johnson with Johnson Architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| We're a firm located on Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Has there been a, I mean, has the builder been, that's not selected yet, or do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| It was a development team which included the developer, the contractor, and the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| The contractor would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Messer Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| And, sir, could you join us at 1130 Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| Or someone from your team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| We'll meet next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| So is anyone else want to address us on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| Do you have anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| If not, the motion on the floor is to send without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| The next item is number 40, resolution 808.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| It's amending the previously adopted five-year capital improvement plan for fiscal years 2012 through 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| and appropriating funds not previously appropriated for the first year of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Moved forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| John Troyer, what are these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Could you give us a rundown of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| The short of it is amending the capital plan for Carter, and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| There's no other changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| So the motion is to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| The next item is number 43, resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| It's requesting the Knox County Purchasing Director to issue a request for proposal, RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| for the purchase and installation of an electronic voting tracking system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| If I might tell the commission, Mr. Arnett, our county clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| has been working on this diligently to get an electronic system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| so that people in the audience would be able to tell how you voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| and also people on TV would be able to tell and we would be able to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| Morristown City Council has adopted and bought a system, which is very inexpensive, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| which would do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| And this could be used by the city if the city wanted to appropriate some funds for its use as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| What I'm asking for is to give the purchasing department the okay to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| and get three different companies so we can take a look at how much it costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| and we can consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| So with that, do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3443)|

| 0:57:28| The next item is on page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| It's item 44, resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| I will be reading a revised version of the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| It is requesting that Tennessee State Representative Ryan A. Hayes consider legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| serving to amend the Tennessee Code annotated to move the offices of the clerk of the criminal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Fourth Circuit Court, and General Sessions Court criminal division in counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| with a charter form of government having a population of not less than 350,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| nor more than 450,000 according to the 2000 federal census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| or any subsequent federal census from the provisions of TCA subsection 8-21-409| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| to the provision of TCA subsection 8-21-401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Ms. McCroskey, if you could give us your name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Joy McCroskey, criminal court clerk, 149 City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| I am mainly here to see if anyone had any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| but my reasoning for going under this section 401, 8-21-401,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3506)|
| 0:58:35| I think it will bring more money in to the clerk's office and to Knox County with flat fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3515)|
| 0:58:44| and the rest of the state is under flat fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| Knox County opted out, I think, in late 2006, early 2007 of that bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| when it was changed from the old fee bill, 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| It would, as an example, I'm not going to go through each office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| but as an example, under the old fee bill, which Knox County operates under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3546)|
| 0:59:13| in criminal court, we're having more and more cases come through as informations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| That's where the lawyers are bypassing the grand jury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| and we don't get an indictment, we get an information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| We collect about $50 in clerk's fees on those informations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| This bill would give me the right to collect $300 in clerk's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| So just that one office would bring in a lot more money, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| The only time it would not bring in more is like if we had more trials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| like these big four defendant murder cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| But as many smaller cases as we have, it would offset it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| And the money would go into the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| It goes to your office first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Anything over payroll and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| It would come back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| I do have one thing I want to alert the Commission to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| Representative Haynes did request and make it a proviso that should this pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| it has to pass by a two-thirds vote, not a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| Generally, your resolutions are a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| So, in other words, you'll need seven votes next week for you to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| Representative Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Joy, you said that, you know, you're getting 50 now and you can go up to 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| Are you going to do these on a case-by-case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| It would be a flat fee, $300 in criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| In Fourth Circuit, for civil cases, it's $225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| For a divorce, it's $42 in sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| Just as clerk's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| All the other fees are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| For the sheriff and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| That's what I thought we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| The next item is number 48, discussion regarding the hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| Mr. Chairman, if I could, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| I'd like to revisit something that we put on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| I failed to pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| It's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Item number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Is anybody here from ETEA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Well, first of all, can we reconsider it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I'd like to make a motion to reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Is there a second to reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Hey, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Is anybody here from ETEDA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| And actually, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| I was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Grant Rosenberg, Knox County Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| I was late to the meeting a few minutes and I didn't have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| I'd like to ask that that item be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| ETEDA has withdrawn their request for funding for this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| No further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| So it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| Yes, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Similar to Mr. or Commissioner Anders' question, number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| I guess David and I missed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| What happened there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Was that consent or withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| That's the Pleasant Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| They were able to do it without closing the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| I've been notified by the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| We need to, Mr. Chairman, we need to address this, number 27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| and change it from consent to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| I'd like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Motion is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| You were asking about the Pleasant Ridge Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| I assume I missed it because we came in 15 minutes late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Mr. Vandivate, if you would, just for Commissioner Shouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| and Commissioner Wright's information, tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3761)|
| 1:02:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Briefly, we have asked the item be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| The core problem we were attempting to solve was the speed of traffic southbound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| on Pleasant Ridge Road at the intersection of Old Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| It's about 45 miles an hour currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| We have an engineering solution that we would like to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| that we think will reduce it to between 30 and 35 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| and enable us to keep the road open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| The next item was the discussion about hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| and ridgetop protection plan, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| This is your item, but I would like to tell Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| I talked with Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| We're going to have a public forum on this September the 29th at 4.30 here in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| So Commission and Council will meet jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| Any member of the public that wants to address us will have an opportunity to do so at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| We've also asked that anyone who has any changes or improvements or suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| with regards to the plan get them to the Commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| I believe Mr. Bailey has also asked that City Council do that by the 23rd at close of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| And so we should have those for you by the Commission meeting on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| So, Jolie, if you would make a note that any suggestions or whatever comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| make sure we have those distributed to the Commissioners on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| So that's kind of the game plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| We've also talked with our law directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| We've also talked with Mr. Bailey about having a special call meeting of the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| and the County Commission to vote on hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| This way we're both together, we both hear the same information at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| and we do not have that date yet, but we're looking at doing a special meeting where we would meet jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| County Commission would vote and then City Council would vote or vice versa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| but we would do that as a meeting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Perhaps have Mr. Joyner here to help facilitate that meeting if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| What was the time on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| September 29th at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| It will be here in this room at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| So I know our friends in the media will help us get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| Jolie, if you would put it on our website as well and send out the proper notices, the City will do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| And that's the purpose of it being on discussion is just to keep it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| After this facilitated process that we went through, we want to get to an end point, and we're moving that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3900)|
| 1:05:08| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| I would like to also remind the Commission that we basically had a couple of proposals that were offered as potential amendments to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3911)|
| 1:05:26| Again, the thing that I offered, the proposal that I offered, and we had another offer from Councilman Della Volpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3926)|
| 1:05:37| I would still, of course, like to appeal for ours from the point of view that these were the amendments were specifically structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3937)|
| 1:05:49| to address questions that came up in the facilitated sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| They're simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| They're simple to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| They're simple changes within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| The structure of the plan does not effectively change at all with those amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| but it does address the issues that we thought needed to be addressed in the facilitated session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3966)|
| 1:06:16| Some of the things that Councilman Della Volpe brought up, very good issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| Frankly, issues that will cause the development community great consternation if they look at those closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| I think there are things that need to certainly, many of those things will be addressed in processes after the plan is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=3990)|
| 1:06:42| There's nothing that Councilman Della Volpe had to present that I was opposed to in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4002)|
| 1:06:49| but it would take us back into a process that would be years in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| Remember, I think we all effectively agreed to agree on the changes that needed to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| and it seemed these bodies were in agreement that a vast majority of the plan was good and effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4025)|
| 1:07:14| and so I'm hoping that we can go forward with a positive vote and an acceptance of those amendments that we proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4034)|
| 1:07:25| You know, after hearing the form, and I'm glad that we've got the form set up and we can move ahead maybe in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| We need to get this behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| This has been a long, long process, and we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Our next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| The next item is number 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| It's discussion regarding the stormwater issue at Copper Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| This issue I was asking the stormwater department engineering to give us some information, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4074)|
| 1:08:02| about the incident that happened out on Childress Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| So I guess I'd just like for Dwight to do that or Chris or whoever would like to give us a summary of what they found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4085)|
| 1:08:22| We're both pretty familiar with it, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| I guess what I might do is let Chris speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| and I'll give a copy of this letter to the balance of the commission while he gives the overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4108)|
| 1:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Well, I guess I'll take the punch line out of the letter everybody's going to be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| Yeah, I guess basically the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| Chris, could you set us up with the site and sort of the background information for people that are unfamiliar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| I mean, I don't know how many of us don't know the level of understanding that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4139)|
| 1:09:07| So sort of just where it is, what kind of site it is, who is, you know, is it Rufus Smith Properties, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4147)|
| 1:09:16| blah, blah, blah, that kind of basic stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| It's a development by Smith Built, and it's located on Childress Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| front of Childress Road, which is in the north part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| It happens to be an area that's a fairly high elevation above a road, I guess, directly north or northwest of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4172)|
| 1:09:44| Dawson Hollow Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| And the site was originally permitted in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| It actually predates the current construction permitting regulations that are driven by the TDEC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4193)|
| 1:10:02| And it was relatively inactive for a pretty long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4202)|
| 1:10:10| And then the Smith Built located on site and began grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4210)|
| 1:10:20| and I guess it became an issue in a lot of people's mind earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4220)|
| 1:10:29| I'm looking down at the letter because I don't have the notes all in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4229)|
| 1:10:37| There was actually a notice of violation issued to the developers on June 8th, following on June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4237)|
| 1:10:47| And this is 2011 inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| And I believe there was an appeal meeting, and there was even a request to continue the corrections to the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4250)|
| 1:11:01| But by all accounts, the work was being corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| As we know, in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| The NOV was specifically for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4271)|
| 1:11:20| And by the way, is this area within what we would call the HRPA in terms of the hillside protection area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4280)|
| 1:11:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Yes, this area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| If our plan had been in effect, this would be an area that would have been covered, right, the HRPA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| The notice of violation was issued for failure to install erosion sediment controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| temporary controls were not properly installed or functional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| and failure to temporarily stabilize areas within 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| Essentially, these are pretty common notices of violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| and this is what you would get with a site that hasn't been particularly active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| It was up for a bond renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| An inspector went out on site and saw these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| I guess notably in this notice of violation, the pond itself wasn't a particularly strong area of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4329)|
| 1:12:18| Now that was the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| Yeah, June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| Inspection was June 6th, and later in June we had a series of heavy rainfalls, I think the 21st and 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4350)|
| 1:12:44| I'm going by the letter that you all have received now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| But basically what we had was a situation where the temporary ponds that are put in place during construction were overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| The first storm filled the ponds up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| The second set of storms went through, and the ponds overtopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| And the end result was that there was a pond failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| and there was a rush of water and mud from the pond that ran off site, ran off stream, and caused damage to property below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4386)|
| 1:13:15| Do you have some description of the property damage down below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4395)|
| 1:13:25| You look like you've probably been a little more on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| In general, not, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| I've probably been a little more on the site, Commissioner, than Chris has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| But there's a residence directly below the site that sits essentially in the natural drainage way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| and it did catch the volume of water in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| There was an outbuilding that was destroyed, and there was damage to the finished floor elevation of the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| Okay, so did it destroy a house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| Effectively, those people no longer live in this house, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| To the best of my knowledge, they do not live there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| They have issues, I believe, identified with mold and potentially with the structural stability of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4444)|
| 1:14:12| but I don't know that for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| I do know that mold and pathogens and similar things have been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| Okay, they vacated the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Okay, go ahead, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| Other property damage besides this home and the one that was primarily damaged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4465)|
| 1:14:36| Were there two properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| There may have been another property on the Dawson Hollow Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| But no structural damage to the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| It was more adjacent property and drainage issues and, you know, just their land was affected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| And part of the issue, the property between the development and this first property had hot tubs and debris on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4495)|
| 1:15:08| that actually caused some of the damage, you know, flowing in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Okay, so there were some other issues with another property owner that had improperly disposed of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| I mean, used it as a dump or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| It was basically illegal, I don't know what you would call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| An illegal dump in some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Okay, to the issue of phasing, I know TDEC's pond requirements, construction pond requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4528)|
| 1:15:37| I mean, what would we do if we don't know when or if this plan is going to be in effect or operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4537)|
| 1:15:46| In the meantime, as we start to, you know, address new sites and development issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4546)|
| 1:15:55| that could be in an HRPA or potential HRPA, what would we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| I mean, would we change anything based on this particular activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| I don't know whether Smithville went in and phased the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| I mean, could we insist on that in a situation that's a forested hillside with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| with this kind of potential damage and property owners down below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| So we're just, you know where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| I mean, what can we do to prevent this in the meantime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| Is there anything that we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| Well, in part, I think the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| There's always a risk when you build a pond and whether it's a pond per the state erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4594)|
| 1:16:41| and sediment control specification or it's a permanent stormwater pond or it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| a recreational pond that you put in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| There's always going to be a risk of pond failure, and there's no way to avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| For, in this case, the phasing is a key issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| and that's something that I mentioned that this was permitted before the current TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| construction permit requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| Phasing is required now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| So this site would require at least three different phases showing interim states of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| So if there's a point that the drainage patterns may not be established per their permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| or the as-designed site, there would be a drainage plan to accommodate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| and it would give something that inspectors would be able to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| and see is this consistent with this stage in the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| So that's an important tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| I think that goes into play, you know, in any site that's permitted today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| and I think it would be helpful in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| What about the people down below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Say we had a project now and it popped up in a similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| That's a tricky question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| That's a tricky question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| It's probably a tough one to say because it's certainly an established drainage way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4685)|
| 1:18:15| and so I don't know what exactly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4695)|
| 1:18:25| if there's anything that I would recommend from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| We certainly consider downstream drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| We look downstream in the watershed for sites that come in for plans review now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| to see what the nature of the drainage system is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| But there's always a wild card possibility of somebody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| dumping some kind of crazy illegal landfill material or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| Okay, but the landfill wasn't the cause of the property damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| That just so happened to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| It might have acted in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| It might have contributed in some way, but that wasn't the cause of the damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| In the capacity of the drainage system, it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| I don't know if I really have an answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| Certainly it's a large drainage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Well, all I'm trying to do is, in the meantime, when we have projects like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| if there is, in the permitting process, there are things that we can do and emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| and stress, and I hope that we're doing those things in consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| and in using this as an example of government's obligation to the people of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4785)|
| 1:19:53| to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Chris, when we went out and issued that, that was issued, what did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4798)|
| 1:20:06| It was issued on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| How much time did they have to fix the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| Was it 30 days that you allow or how much time did you give them, two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| I believe it was the 22nd that it was required to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Tony, just to give you some, I went out there and looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| and the first thing that I saw with it, Tony, the retention pond wasn't big at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| And then I went down and looked at the house that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| And there was, it was basically a split basement rancher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| and it came in the first and went down to the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| The gentleman took me inside his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| There's no way you could have lived in that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| It was, I mean, the house had to be tore down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| And above that, between the retention pond and the house, was the illegal dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| And that water picked up these hot tubs, and they were huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| They were 10 foot by, or 12 foot by 6 foot wide, split in two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| And they were strung all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| It was from here to Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| How far did that stuff end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Up there and in this guy's yard, it went down below him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| But water just, it was quite a bit of water, but a lot of it, like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| was illegal dump that was just washed out, went down this guy, and tore his house up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| And as I understand, I think Smithville was supposed to be giving this guy a new home from the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| But that's, it's still out there if you want to go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| If I could speak to one thing, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| I would want the commission to know that the owner of the property that had the illegal landfill was issued an NOV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| And that portion of the site that is his property has been cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4905)|
| 1:21:52| And also there was debris that crossed Dawson Hollow Road across from the property of the Carters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| And that debris we have cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| For the sake of absolute accuracy, I imagine there is probably still debris from the illegal landfill on the property of the Carters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4921)|
| 1:22:09| But that's a matter that's being handled at litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| Both the Carters and the Dowlings, who I think are the family upstream, Commissioner Norman, that you had referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4933)|
| 1:22:20| are represented by counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| We have had contact with them just in a cooperative spirit to try to move things along a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| and get some of the debris that we think is in the public right of way removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| But the landfill has been remediated and that debris has been cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| Chris, have you been out to the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Have you seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| The next item is number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| It is discussion regarding all Mounts County property not currently being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| and what the plans are for those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Is there anybody from the mayor's office here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| Where is that man at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| Commissioner, here is what I wanted to talk about and discuss, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| I think, is the school over there, is it Oakwood School, is that the name of the school where the rain came through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| Oak Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| Oakwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Oakwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| We had a similar situation in South, was it Flinnington School, is that the name of that school where the roof caved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| when we sold the property, we sold it for $117,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| South High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Oh, South High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| We sold it for $117,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| I mean, it's a beautiful school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| We went and we toured it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| And, gentlemen, the whole gymnasium was, there was no roof over three-quarters of the gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| And through different places the school had, I mean, had water damage, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| That school is easily worth, at the time, could have been worth a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| We got $117,000 out of it, and we were lucky to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| Well, now we have another scenario at another school where the roof had a leak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5052)|
| 1:24:20| and I read in the paper that an architect went out there and tried to patch it himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| which he shouldn't have been out there doing, but he, as a private citizen, tried to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| Well, it rained so much that the third floor fell down to the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| Now, what's that school worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| I went by a rural high school a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| Same scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Windows busted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| It looks terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| I just want, you know, as a taxpayer, and we own these properties, these are our assets that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| and our assets are losing ground every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| We need to decide what we're going to do with our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| What I'd like to see for each of the commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| I'd like to know what the county owns in each district so each commissioner would know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| and especially if it is vacant land or a building, what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| What are our plans for that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| We, as commissioners, just need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| I mean, we're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| We're the eyes and ears for the community, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| So we'd like to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| Now, I'm just real disappointed that we have another asset that we have here worth several million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| Now, we may have to end up having to pay to have the thing hauled away, and it's going to cost us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| And to me, I'm sorry, but this is inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| It's inexcusable to let our assets that we have, if we had a building at home, whatever, and we just let it go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5142)|
| 1:25:49| that's a slap in the face to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| And, you know, there's a lot of community pride out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| So, Mayor, talk to me, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| Tim Burchett, 6401 Airtree, county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| As far as the Oakwood, the one with the recent, we only had that for, I think, less than a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| and we're actually in the middle of negotiating, I believe, an RFP for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| Rural High School is still owned by the school system, and if I'm correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| I believe they've leased it to a minister for a dollar a year, and the South High School, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5180)|
| 1:26:28| That was a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Yes, and that was through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| Hugh Hull, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Old South High School, we actually had issued an RFP originally to sell that to a developer named Lee Birch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5195)|
| 1:26:43| The commission voted that down and asked us to go back and sell that property by public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| We did so, and it sold to a gentleman named Ben Kasseri for, I think, Mr. Smith was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| It was for approximately $117,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Hugh, is this stuff that the school board needs to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| I mean, are we stepping out of bounds, but this is two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| I'm not looking to pick any fights with the school system just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| So, I think we're just going to try to say grace on what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| And I think we're working to a conclusion on the Oakwood school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| And as far as the others go, they're in the process through the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| But I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| I think we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| And I think this Oakwood situation just brought it to our attention a lot quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| But we are in the middle of working on something for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| You know, Mr. Chairman, I'm looking for some guidance here as to, you know, what we do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| You know, is this something that we take before the school board and just bring them in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| But if we're overstepping our bounds with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| But the bottom line is Knox County taxpayers own all these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| And they're our assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| Either we want to fix them up and at least maintain them as is, or we need to sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| I like your proposal, Commissioner Smith, that we ask that any Knox County property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| whether it's owned by the school or the county, that it be given to us by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| That would be the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| So, if we could have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| When do you think you all could have that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| Four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| By next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| We're kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| That'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| We'll have to work with the school system on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| And because, you know, commissioners are going to come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| But as commissioners in the district, some people are attuned to it and they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| I mean, look here, Dave's got how many thousands of miles that he's got up in his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| I'm sure he pretty much knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| But there might be something that we just don't know where it's sort of hidden behind somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| So, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| I'm not talking about tax property that's going to be sold anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| I'm not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| Especially in any buildings, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Because we're the eyes and ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| And maybe we can help you sell something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| We're never going to do anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| If we get it back on the tax rolls, I think that's the important thing, is that it just doesn't sit idle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| I mean, when we, in this Carter proposal, trying to sell some surplus property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| and we found a piece that I think was attached to an airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| We found one that was in the middle of a subdivision that's probably there since the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| Nobody's really even sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| You know, and we've had school situations in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| and nobody really even knew who had possession of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| Of course, it's the school board's policy, and it has been for some time, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| is not to put money into a building that doesn't have children in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| So, I think that's, you know, and I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| But I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| We need surplus property that needs to be out so we can get on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| But the school board needs to remember that taxpayers pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| And you've got, you take rural high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| Let this guy have it for a dollar a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| But as I went by just a couple hours ago, windows busted out everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| It's rain just getting right in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| And the guy that's getting that, when the floor collapses on it, he's going to walk out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| And there we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| It's going to end up back with us in result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Whenever the school does abandon a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| is it an automatic reversal back to the county as far as ownership of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5407)|
| 1:30:14| Commissioner Brown, the way the code reads is that basically by action of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| they deem the property surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| and then the county accepts it through legislative action of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| I ran into a little problem out south on some land that was bought for the New Hope School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| And I wanted to move some of the practice field up there for South Dole High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| and got shot down on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| And they moved the rescue squad in there for a dollar a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| So something just doesn't gel on a lot of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| That was a school board decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| Yes, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Yeah, I concur with Commissioner Smith on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| I talked to a lot of citizens, and I went to Oakwood Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| So I'm kind of sentimental to that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| Of course, it was only kindergarten and first grade, but still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| The thing is, is that if we build a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| Christopher Elementary was built, and that's when Oakwood was closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| and so was Lincoln Park, to combine all the kids into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| Why do we sit on them for 15, 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| I know it's the school board, but it's still the taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| And if we're going to close these schools and build new ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| then we need to get those back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| We need to sell them while they're still looking halfway decent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| And I would like to know what's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| I mean, I can drive by, but there's a lot of stuff that's plotted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| I don't know if the county owns it, the state owns it, regular citizen owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| So it would be nice to know what we have and if the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| maybe it's something we look at in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| that if we're building a new school to take place of one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| that that automatically gets turned back over to the citizens that bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| So that's a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| And typically what the school system will do after an event like that has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| where you've built a new school and you've transferred kids from an older school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| they will use those facilities for storage, temporary storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| for a period of time where they feel like the building no longer serves their needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| and then they turn it over to us and then we have the joy of disposing of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5547)|
| 1:32:34| That's after all the stuff they stored in there is rotted too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| Just so we're clear, commissioners, just to follow up on that before you go further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| our code does outline with specificity the manner in which we can divest ourselves of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| And I think people are under presumption that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| the mayor can start wholesaling property and selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| Well, it has to be declared surplus and the commission is the final determinant of authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| in terms of divesting the county of its real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| Yeah, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| I just don't want us or the school system, whoever, to hang on to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| They used it as, I guess, a teacher's depot up until when they brought it to us and decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| but if we're not going to keep any upkeep on it and we're not going to do any maintenance work on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| we're just using it as a storage building like the rural high school that's sitting over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| until a few months ago that was leased out for a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| Then it's handed over to us to pay for the demolition and to clear it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| and then try to sell the property for what everyone can get out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| So I'd like not to wait so long before this stuff gets dropped into our laps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| As I stated, I'm really not looking for a fight with the school system just this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| So we're addressing those issues and we're moving, I think, in a business-like manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| So we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| I was concerned, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| It's hindsight now, but do you recall what Lee Birch was going to pay for that building south?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| I believe $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| But with the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Yes, $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| But within the first year, Lee was going to invest $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| In the condos or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| It's a mixed-use type development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| You, while you're checking in on this, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| if they rent this guy here at rural high school and he's renting it for a dollar a year or whatever, can they not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| just like what Commissioner Olmey said, can they not put in there a clause or can we add it at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| that you're going to maintain it, so at least keep it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| Well, as again, as I've stated, that's up to the school system and the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| We, I don't believe we don't engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| But, Mayor, it still comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| We're the one that gets, you know, you all let this go bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| Well, that's something that probably needs to be brought up between the law department and the courts, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| You can rail on me all you want to on the issue, but until, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| I think it's going to have to be decided by somebody else, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| Because I think you know where I am on surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| But, you know, you where I'm at, if a man's going to be in there for a dollar a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| he also needs to maintain it and at least keep it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| Joe Lee, do we have a surplus property committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| Don't we have something that does something with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| Do the trustees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5729)|

| 1:35:41| So we've got some kind of committee, but we may need to look into putting that committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| Is it no longer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| We'll look into that and have the law director look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5752)|

| 1:36:03| It is discussion regarding an amendment to the commission meeting rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| And that was our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| I believe he has disappeared again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| We'll go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5775)|

| 1:36:24| Is it good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Is it bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| I mean, this was kind of our first go at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| The flashing red light after five is a little bit severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| We asked John for an explosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Yeah, we thought we could have a buzzer or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| Wait until your chair is plugged up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| No, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| So everybody seems to like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5802)|

| 1:36:48| The test will be when the attorneys speak in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| Let's go back to 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Sir, I'm still reviewing that simply because the state of North Carolina now is essentially looking to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| what I've been researching, so I'd like to just, if we could, table this until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5820)|

| 1:37:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Mr. Hammond, I had a question sort of related to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| Are we going to discuss committees in our reorganization when we had our reorganization vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| I thought at that time or in the next meeting we would discuss committee formation or reassignments to committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| The committees were done for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Okay, so there's no need to do anything now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| There was, I guess I would like, I'd like to form a committee, which I think the county needs another committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5857)|
| 1:37:50| So if we wanted to form another committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| No, the charter doesn't allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5874)|
| 1:38:01| You want to get together with the law director and draw it up and bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| Okay, that's what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| Do we hear a motion that we approve the line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5889)|

| 1:38:11| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110919?start=5891)|
