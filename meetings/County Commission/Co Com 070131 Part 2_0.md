| 0:00:00| I just want to thank the county commission, the commission in the 9th district, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| people of our 9th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=10)|
| 0:00:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=12)|
| 0:00:13| Can we have a five minute recess while you're all talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=13)|
| 0:00:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=24)|
| 0:00:25| Granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| Five minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=26)|
| 0:00:33| All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=33)|
| 0:00:54| We're back to district 4, district 4 county commission seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=54)|
| 0:01:05| I think we're back, Mr. Clark, to two nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| Nominees are Scott Davis and Lee Tramble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| Start in the 9th district if you don't care, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=73)|
| 0:01:20| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| Mr. Chairman, a procedural point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| I noticed that someone new seated at the commission table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| I was supposed to introduce the new commissioner from the 2nd district, Mr. Chuck Bolas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| He's been duly sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| Mr. Chairman, you stated earlier in the meeting that you will be swearing all the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| at the very end of the proceeding, and this sort of sudden and selective swearing in of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| one I think really stinks up a process that is already beginning to smell up the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| We can ask the law director if the process is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| This has always been a possibility that this would occur, and we have discussed it, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| This commissioner is filling a term limited commissioner's seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| He has taken the oath of office, whether it's on our agenda or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| He has taken an oath of office, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| His oath has been filed with the clerk's office, and in my opinion, he may take his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| You know, Mr. Commissioner Speed, you got sworn in early, too, in the last election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| so I mean, it's your duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Do you read my mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| No, I was just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| I was going to agree with the law director that this is a legal move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| Let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Are you sure, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| This is a legal move, but the intent of this move is simply to put in a candidate from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| a certain faction on this commission, and I think the process here speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| It stings to high heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| No disrespect to Mr. Bolus, who I do not know, but this is obviously a move that is, at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| very least, duplicious and underhanded, and it is disrespectful to Commissioner Gutta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| It is disrespectful to myself, and it is an insult to the people of the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| should this vote turn out the way I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Okay, Commissioner Gutta, I don't know if we're really supposed to be talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| I have been disrespected before, and I'm sure this won't be the last time I'll get past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| it, but I want you to notice that we've saved the last until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| I didn't say we saved the best until last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| I said we saved the last until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| But I do want to ask the Law Director a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| In addition to the commission, since the makeup of commission has changed, there may be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:58| that would question whether or not we have to start over from the beginning and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| nominations from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| I would like to have you respond to that, to those that might think that way, starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| all over, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| For this vote, I think you make a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| I think you make a real good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| This commissioner has not been involved in the vote, has just been sworn, and so with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| that said, I would agree with Commissioner Gutta that we ought to start over in the 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=263)|
| 0:04:31| District with the nomination process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| I don't think you need a motion for that effect, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| We've heard a ruling from the Law Department that we should start from the beginning again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| I think this body respects the opinion of the Law Director and we respect the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| So Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| I just have a question for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Would it, for any of the other folks who have already been appointed, they have the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| of going ahead and being sworn in too, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| They have always had that option, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| In the interest of fairness, I so move that we take a recess for ten minutes and any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| the newly appointees who choose to go ahead and take their oath, we allow them to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| their oath and take their seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| That would only be fair, don't you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| I think if anyone wants to take their seat, they have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:26| I'll make a motion then that we recess until these officers be sworn in and then we reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| Do we have a second question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| They have to request to be sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| They were not asked to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| What if you can't reach some of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Those that are here, let them get sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| That wouldn't be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| If they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| If they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| I think Mr. Cate was asked early on and he didn't want to get sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| I don't know if anybody else wants to get sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Commissioner Jordan, I don't think she said Commissioner Josh Jordan wants to be sworn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=358)|
| 0:05:58| If we want to start over, we need to finish the process because we've got a two o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:02| We've got to get this government back to going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| And so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| That chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| I think, well, that's your opinion, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| I'm not sure that you've answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Do we at least need to make a phone call to the ones that maybe are not present that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| want to be sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| Mr. Law Director, do you want to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| That's up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| We've got a swearing in set for two o'clock and I think most people understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| But they've always had the option and we realized that someone could take an oath of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| office and I think Mr. Bolus did so because the 2nd District wasn't being represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| That was the only member missing on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| We had a 19 member body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| It went down to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| So I don't know if we want to just recess to do the whole thing because the 2nd District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| wasn't represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Mr. Chairman, if I made a motion to have a recess to allow people to be sworn in, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| withdraw that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| I'm ready to go on and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| But I would also say if there are those here that have been appointed that would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| be sworn in, that they stand up now and be recognized and get sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| Does anybody here that's been appointed to County Commission wish to take their seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| right now at this point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Mr. Chairman, may I take a point of personal privilege to your statement that the 2nd District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| was not being represented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| I'm saying it's not represented with two members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| You've got one member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Everybody else has got two members voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| So I don't think you can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Your clarification is just all that I needed because I'm representing the 2nd District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| and a lot of people out there who dislike this process very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| You're representing the 2nd District, but you're representing it without your counterpart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| Mr. Chairman, did not the law director say when we first started this process that anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| that chose to go out in the hallway out there and get sworn in would have the right to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| in and take this seat immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Apparently, Mr. Bolus is the only one that wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| The others aren't here, apparently, or they didn't follow through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| So I see nothing wrong with Mr. Bolus sitting in this seat because he took the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| from the law director, and everybody had that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| I say we start just over...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| We've got rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| We have to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| We may not like them, but it's like the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| These things we have to do, and we have to bite the bullet sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Now, you can say it stinks or does what, but everybody else had the same opportunity as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| Mr. Bolus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Okay, I think we need to get back to the nomination process, and so we'll start over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| in the fourth district and take nominations all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| So let's start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| Mr. Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=515)|

| 0:16:02| Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| I'm Knox County Mayor Mike Ragsdale, and it's my pleasure to be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| As appropriate, we're going to start today's program with an invocation, which will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| delivered by Gail Lyons, the Chaplain of the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| Will you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| Will you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| I pray from the Christian perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| If you're of another faith, I invite you to join us in this prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Would you bow your heads with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Father, we are here because we believe in orderly government, and we're here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| we believe that these people have been chosen to lead us, and I pray, Father, that you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| help each of these people to lead us wisely, with integrity, with honesty, and, Father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| to give the best of their ability to those who have selected them and the people they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| We pray, Father, that you'd give us harmony and help us to do the work of government the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| way it ought to be, so it would be good and pleasing to you and helpful to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| I ask that you'd be with each and every one of these new office holders and give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| the wisdom they need and compassion and patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| I pray for those, Father, who have left office, and I thank you for them, for their kindnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| toward me and for the service they've given you and this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| And, Lord, as we come to this moment when we celebrate with these who have been chosen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| we ask that you bless them, use them, and help them to remember always to be servants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| of the people and a servant of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| And we commit them to your care, knowing that you have said in your Word that all government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| is of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| So thank you now for blessing this service by your very presence, in the name that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| above every name, Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| If you'll please remain standing, it is my pleasure at this time to introduce the Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| of the Knox County Commission, the Honorable Scott Moore, who will lead us in the Pledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| of Allegiance to our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Everyone will face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:40| At this time, I'll turn it back over for some remarks from the Honorable Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:49| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| I'm delighted that you asked me to say a few words today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| Let me begin by congratulating those who won appointments to office this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| I can tell you in many ways, I think it is more difficult to win an appointment from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| County Commission than it is to win an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| So I applaud you for going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| I appreciate your efforts and want to extend my heartfelt congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| You today that are taking the oath of office are a part of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| Rarely in the annals of our country and certainly our state have we been faced with this type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| of challenge, where the Supreme Court rules that a group of people can no longer serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| and it's up to a legislative body to pick their replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Difficult situation, difficult challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| You also have an opportunity today to be a part of history, particularly going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| I would be less than candid with you right now if I didn't tell you that in many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| the people's faith and trust in their government has been shaken and somewhat stunned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| However, as new elected officials, you have the opportunity along with me and those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| are currently in office to turn that around, to make a difference, and rewrite history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| in a very positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Right now there are a good many fine things that are going on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| I want to share just a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Across this county, our children who represent our future, their test scores going up each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| and every month in all parts of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| That's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| They're higher than any time since the No Child Left Behind benchmarks were established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Knox County high school graduates' ACT scores are higher not only than the state average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| but higher than the national average, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| We have broad community support for public education, and we're making a real difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| in the lives of children each and every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| We've been successful in our efforts to make every school a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Now it's time for us to join hands, finish the course, and make that broad goal a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| We've also been successful in the area that I like to call economic results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| We've created 22,000 new regional jobs over the past three years for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| We have one of the lowest unemployment rates not only in this state, but anywhere in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| We're seeing family incomes go up, and over the past three years we've had over $2 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| in new non-residential capital investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Here's some interesting things to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| How do others view us right now from across the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| Well, CNN said we were one of the ten best places in America to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| Expansion Magazine said that Knoxville and Knox County was the ninth hottest community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| in the country to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| Forbes Magazine, internationally respected, said we were the fifth best place in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| to have a business or to have a career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Salary.com said we were the third best place in the country to grow personal wealth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| and the Economic Research Institute picked Knoxville, Knox County, and East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| as the best place in the country for a young college graduate to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| Those are nice accolades, and we're doing a nice job of consistently creating new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| and better jobs for our citizens, and I hope we can continue down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| Also several years ago, we made a commitment to our senior citizens and our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| We said that we were not going to let them be overlooked, forgotten, or left behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| and we're on a good path toward making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Just this past month, we opened our new Veterans Administration Nursing Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| a project which would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| working with the state and the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| And I can tell you it was a pleasure for me to be on hand today when the first two gentlemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| were moved into our Veterans Administration Nursing Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| That was a great experience and one that I won't ever forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Also, attendance at our senior centers goes up each and every month, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| We've expanded senior centers across this community and built new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| We have one that will be opening relatively soon in South Knoxville that I'm going to be very proud of, as you will also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| We had a waiting list at one point in time for mobile meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| That's no longer with us. That's gone away. That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| And our senior citizens can now ride CAT buses any time of the week, any day, free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| Those are all positive type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| Today, though, it's important that we do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| When President Ford was laid to rest a couple of weeks back, I reflected on his book, A Time to Heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:33| It's a time for Knox County to heal. It's a time for us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| And today we find ourselves at a crossroads, a crossroads where we can go in one of two directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:46| We can either fight with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| We can have lots of political bickering, lots of grandstanding, and as a result, our community will suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| Or we can go forward on a more progressive path where we forget what's gone on in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| turn a leaf to a new page, and go forward in the best interest of all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| That's the path I plan on taking, and that's the path I hope that you'll join me on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| I can tell you without question that the new commissioners, the new constitutional officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| will have the complete support of this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| Our goal is to make you the best trustee, the best registrar, the best sheriff, the best clerk, the best commissioner that you can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:31| And in doing so, I will become the best mayor that I can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| So in going forward, I want to tell you again congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| I also want to thank those who will be leaving office because I've enjoyed working with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| and I appreciate your many contributions to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| So let's turn the page. Let's move forward in a direction where Knox County can and will become a great American community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:57| and in doing so will fulfill our God-given destiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| So to each of you, congratulations, Godspeed, and I look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:12| Installation of Sheriff J.J. Jones, oath administered by Judge Dale Workman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| Escorts will accompany him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| For those of you who are not aware, the sheriff is a little bit unique, most of the other office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| in that in addition to the sheriff, each individual deputy has to be sworn and there's a lot of paperwork involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| Usually it takes weeks to do this and this was done within hours today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| And thanks to the commission chair and members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| we had a swearing-in ceremony of the sheriff earlier during the commission meeting so he could go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| We're going to leave here in a little while and go out and swear in all the deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| We had to get all that paperwork ready so he's already been administered his oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| and I'm not going to repeat it again in front of this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| But I want to point out one thing about the good sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Y'all know I like history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| He is not the very first person by the name of Jones ever to be elected sheriff of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| The previous sheriff, Jones, was elected in 1950 in between Austin Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| Austin Cate served from 48 to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| C.W. Buddy, sleepless Jones, served from 50 to 52 and then Austin Cate was elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| Austin Cate has two claims to fame and that last one you just heard is sleepless Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Sheriff Jones, while he was sheriff at that time, Fountain City was in the county, not in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| And there was a murder in Fountain City of a prominent citizen's wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| And Sheriff Jones was called and was quoted in the paper as saying he would never sleep until he solved that murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| To this day, that murder has never been solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| He is known as sleepless Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| You've got a lot to live up to, sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| As a footnote to the history, how do I know so much about sleepless Jones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| As things drug on and progress was not made, the sheriff asked for help from the city police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| Sound familiar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| And they assigned a detective to work on that case from the city police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| That detective's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Frank C. Workman, my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| And that's the reason I know so much about sleepless Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Your new sheriff, J.J. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| And this is my second go-around, so I'm going to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| And I do know that bit of history that he was talking about, so maybe I won't make that same mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| But I look forward to working with all the new commissioners, all the new officeholders, and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part2?start=1667)|
