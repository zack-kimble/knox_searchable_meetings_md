| 0:00:31| Welcome to the Board of Education September 8th regular session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| Our moment of silence and pledge of allegiance will be led by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=35)|
| 0:00:39| Please stand for a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=39)|
| 0:00:58| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=64)|
| 0:01:13| Okay, so a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=73)|
| 0:01:22| Our next policy review meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, September 22nd at 1.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| and the meeting location will be announced when the meeting packet is distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| Board members, I will be considering appointments to committees and other roles in the next few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| so if you haven't set your preferences to Ms. Coatney, I'll need you to do that so we can get our meeting set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=98)|
| 0:01:46| And lastly, I just wanted the opportunity to thank Ms. Warren for her service as board chair for the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=106)|
| 0:01:54| especially this last year, because I know it's been difficult for all of us and we really appreciate your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=114)|
| 0:02:02| And I know that I speak for the entire board when I say thank you and you've done a wonderful job representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| So we do have a couple of changes to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| You received this information via email, but I wanted to note publicly that two time-sensitive items were added to the meeting agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=136)|
| 0:02:26| one to allow Halston Middle School's band to perform and travel to Disney as item 6C21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=146)|
| 0:02:37| and another item dealing with a purchase order with Pearson Aimsweb for provision of benchmark and progress monitoring tools for grades 4-12 as item 6C22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=157)|
| 0:02:50| In addition, the second reading version of board policy J120 attendance has been updated based on discussion at last week's call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=170)|
| 0:02:59| and the backup documentation for item 10C regarding a fund balance designation has been updated to reflect the correct amount in the agenda caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=179)|
| 0:03:10| And we can have discussion on each of these new items and updates as items are read for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=190)|
| 0:03:19| Are there any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=199)|
| 0:03:29| So we have a motion to approve the agenda by Ms. Horne, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| And we do have a special recognition tonight, and I think Dr. Wilson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=220)|
| 0:03:51| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| We were able to do something this past July that I don't know if we've called official recognition to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| so we wanted to take a minute to do that and not wait until two years from now when we had our first graduating cohort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| because we felt like that was a little bit long to go without recognizing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| About three years ago, Dr. Reissig and Mr. Bolton and myself went down to Nashville to meet with some folks from TDOE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| to talk about a grant opportunity in relation to our district becoming its own education preparation provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| for our occupationally licensed teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| As I became a new CTE director about four and a half years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| it became evident very quickly what a challenge it was for folks who were coming in from industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| as previously working as nurses or electricians or welders or, you know, you name it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| and moving into the education sector, not only to get up to speed with things like students and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| and curriculum and all of that, but then also to have to go through changing careers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| while then pursuing their teaching license, which usually required them to enroll with a post-secondary institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| and follow a certain sequence of coursework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| And a change in the law a few years back now allows LEAs to become their own EPPs, education providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| And so the state was interested in a regional opportunity here in our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| that would serve our district as well as other districts in that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| And so we were able to, actually the responsibility, I guess, got bounced around for a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| but it ended up landing with CTE last year, and we were able to go through the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| And this past July, the State Board of Education authorized Knox County Schools to serve as its own EPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| We actually started our first class, our first cohort of occupational teachers this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| who have been engaged in the work, had kind of an intensive experience during the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| and then a lot of what they do really is job-embedded learning and practice throughout the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| We've partnered with SREB, the Southern Regional Education Board, if you're familiar with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| as a curriculum support, and they're doing a lot of the training and kind of coaching us up on how to deliver some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| But I wanted tonight to kind of draw attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| I think as a moment we can take and celebrate for that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| It does open some doors and opportunities down the line for us as a district to be able to use that EPP status in different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| if we see that as a needed recruitment and retention tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| But I also wanted to introduce and allow Ula Carr, who is a CTE specialist in my department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| and has done the lion's share of the legwork on this and continues to lead this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| to tell you a little bit about kind of who's involved and what we'll be doing with that program in the year to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| and then, again, moving forward in the future with future cohorts of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| So, Ms. Carr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| As Keith already said, my name is Ula Carr, and I'm a CTE and EPP specialist for our Korean Technical Education Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| In that role, my work was largely centered around getting our application in front of the state last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| getting that approved, and this year to roll out the program itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| I'm proud to say we have 20 candidates already in our first cohort this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| They come largely from our own Knox County Schools District, but also from four surrounding districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| and from fields like cosmetology, culinary, collision repair, information technology, health sciences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=432)|
| 0:07:21| So those are all teaching fields that we would love for our students to gain experiences in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| and therefore we need teachers, so oftentimes we pull them out of industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| and they don't have that pedagogical background and earn that through our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| We are meeting throughout the school year. We started with an intensive training week back in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| We are utilizing district learning days to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| We are meeting virtually and in person when safety protocols allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| Our candidates also have a clinical placement as teachers of record, so it's a job-embedded placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=471)|
| 0:08:00| and overall the program therefore has a theoretical coursework component and a practical component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| And in the practical placement and the clinical placement, they are given an assigned mentor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| so that they have support right there at the school as well, as well as administrative support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| through a designated principal at their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| And all of those people have been trained in the past May, right before the school year ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=502)|
| 0:08:30| The cohort coursework is stretched over 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| followed by a semester of intense preparation for them to take the practice exam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| the principles of learning and teaching one, and once they successfully complete that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| as well as our EPP program itself, then they have fulfilled a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| to advance their practitioner occupational license to a professional occupational license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| and are one step closer to being considered a professional, successful teacher in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| after going through these first three years of intense training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| So overall, we hope for this program to be supportive, of course, for our new teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| and overall to lead to higher retention amongst those teachers who are joining us in the CTE program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=552)|
| 0:09:21| Long shot down the line, we hope to expand our program to also serve other content areas outside of CTE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| but right now we're getting this off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| Ms. Carr and Dr. Wilson, would you like to join me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=574)|
| 0:10:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=604)|
| 0:10:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| And just a reminder to the public, we already had a detailed discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| well, somewhat detailed, I guess, last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| I wouldn't really call that detailed at that time of night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| but typically we would have a detailed discussion on all of the items at the meeting prior to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=652)|
| 0:11:01| And board members, before we consider our consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| does anyone have any questions or discussions on 6C21 or 6C22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| These were the new agenda items that were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=672)|

| 0:13:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Motion by Ms. Babb, second by Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Any discussion? Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| We had a lot of discussion last week related to if this attendance policy is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| how would we be able to delineate data related to virtual students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| related to kids that are out on isolation that might be not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| And I asked Mr. Cox if he would be able to provide to the board an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| of the way this data could be delineated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| because I know we've had a lot of questions in the public about does this unintentionally hide data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| or are we still able to see all the things that we need to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| So I'm loving the sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| It feels like we've got a big reveal coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| I think Mr. Cox was going for effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=883)|
| 0:14:54| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, once the screen pulls up, I've got two charts for comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| that will kind of help you see that this gives us a little bit additional clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| into some of the current absences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| So this is just example data that we pulled, and the chart kind of in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| has the virtual learning section highlighted there in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| and that is currently being counted as absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| So the chart on the right, you'll see those numbers are included in the larger section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| that's just labeled absenteeism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| So if we have this additional code, we'll be able to kind of more finely report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| on those quarantined or isolated students with our attendance data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| So just to be clear, if the attendance policy proceeds and we approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| the chart on the left is a representation of the way we could see that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| where we could still see active cases in relationship to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| that might be out in virtual synchronous learning because they're in a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| that has a waiver at the time versus kids that might be out in isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| but may be doing asynchronous work that's not at a school with a waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| plus all of our other traditional absences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| That's correct, and this chart shows the school waiver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| which is currently how Austin East and Central High School would be reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| so that we can kind of define both school-wide waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| and then individual absences that may be related to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| And so then if this doesn't pass, the chart on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| we lose the ability to be able to delineate those students who might be out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| not on a waiver, but be doing asynchronous makeup work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| I think that's really helpful to kind of see what the possibilities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| of being able to represent and show that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| And I just have one more question, and Mr. Cox, this probably isn't for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| but can somebody just reiterate to us, one, what changes were made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| because I know there were some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| This was sent out about 2.30, so what was the changes made from last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| if you can be specific about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| And then also, if we pass this, what does it add to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| what's the benefit of adding this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| I know the State Board of Education allows for us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Is that you, Mr. Roswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| So currently, so I'm trying to think how far to go back in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| So the revisions that were made in July by the State Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| there was an existing policy prior to that defined virtual programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| versus virtual schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| And so there was no option for any students to be virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| even on a temporary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| What the action from the State Board did in July was it opened up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| opportunity for students who were on temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| They used the word quarantine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| but quarantine and isolation is what they're referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| If the board, if local boards make an action to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| then those students who are on quarantine or in isolation could be counted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| present if there are four criteria and you have to meet two of those four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| The first one would be that teachers teach synchronously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| and obviously that would be difficult for us to do without adding a ton of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| teachers to our current group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| One was that teachers would make daily contacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| visual or phone calls to all of the students that were in their class that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| were on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Again, pretty big burden for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| The two that we're proposing in that would be the asynchronous model that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| says you could use a learning management system for students to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| receive the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| And then the fourth one of those being that students would have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| opportunity either through hard copy or learning management systems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| able to submit that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| So if this passes tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| then we would be able to count students who had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| who are isolated or quarantined present for the 10 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| supposedly that they would be out if they're submitting work during that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| And what's, I've just had a lot of questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| What's the benefit of doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| What's the benefit of marking them present if they're technically out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| doing asynchronous work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| So if you have a couple of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| so one would be for students to be chronically absent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| that's a thing for truancy and those sorts of things that weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Also for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| they get a score for the overall school based on chronic absenteeism by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| students who missed over 10% of the eligible days on their annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| So both of those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| you can knock a bunch of days out in a 10 day quarantine or isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| toward a student's 18 days that would make them chronically absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| So we don't want to penalize a student that's being isolated toward chronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| absenteeism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Or the school they attend, both could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| could be on a list or deemed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| I would just say one other thing too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| absent of this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| students would not be able to be temporarily virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| So you'd be left probably to our current makeup policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| which would be once they return from school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| they have three days to request makeup work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| And then a reasonable amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| I believe is what our policy reads to make that work up. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| so this allows them to do it as they're absent while they're absent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| they could begin that process and start doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| I think it's important to note just for all of our teachers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| I think there was some confusion about what the intent was of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| conversation last week. And I think, I think some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| took a little bit of criticism or took a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| did not appreciate that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| They felt like some people were saying that the same synchronous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| instruction is the same thing as an asynchronous lesson being turned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| that, you know, a student in a classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| that type of learning is very different than a kid just doing a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| of makeup work that we know as a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| we're not saying that that's robust instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| but we are trying to allow for that student to not get further behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| by being able to catch up while they're still out. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| You're totally correct in what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| I didn't say that very smoothly, but we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| I talked about it before and I think you get what I was trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Sure. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| there's probably the simplest way for me to think about is there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| replacement for the student being in the classroom with the teacher every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| but it's better to have some asynchronous assignment that's tied to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| so that the student has a better chance to at least be caught up and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| some version of that when they return is better than to have nothing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| 10 days. And, and if I could just take the opportunity to, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| there was a lot of discussion last week and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| we tried to try to talk through that complicated issue to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| And I just want to make sure just for the record too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| we're not saying that this will not be a challenge for teachers to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| We understand anytime we're asking them to, to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| support Canvas and do those kinds of things that it is, that is an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| I do think it's a great opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| even post COVID for a student who's out for orthodontist appointment or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| strep throat or the flu or those kinds of things that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| that people would have a common place to go and get makeup work. I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| you know, again, if you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| if you're keeping a paper makeup work in your classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| which has kind of been traditionally what we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| that's not equivalent to having been in the class either. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| So we know all makeup work is, is a little flawed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| but I just want to make sure that's clear that in no way we're saying this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| you know, well, this is no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| I should be able to click click and it'd be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| There's some work involved in some lead time, probably for our, our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| even though they did some of that work last year at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| So we do understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| but we're a bit between a rock and a hard place to try to do what's best for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| students at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| And on line 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| there is some allowance for teachers to still allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| allow for hard copy work to be turned in, in the short term, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| that this doesn't all have to be executed tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| that there is some flexibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| And we've actually been working on some communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| We're getting some feedback from principals right now about when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| when a good start date might be trying to get an idea when they feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| their staffs could be up and have the potential to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| We sent something out to principals to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| to begin thinking about that today and give us some input on that. Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| you know, there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| there may be some allowances even once we get to there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| especially in elementary kindergarten and first grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| we've gotten a lot of feedback about that being difficult to do just with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| student's ability to manipulate a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| And obviously we'll defer to our elementary staff and principal feedback on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| that as well, about the best way to do it. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| you try to mitigate germ transfer and virus transfer. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| all those are factors in trying to figure out how to do that. But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| we'll try to use common sense. It won't be perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| but we'll try to do the best we can for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| And there'll be some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| it sounds like there'll be some flexibility at the school level in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| I think there will. We, we want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| we were actually in some conversations with principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| We want to be sure that we don't set up a situation where it's like total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| flexibility. There's some level of district expectation. So it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| there's some guardrails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Right. Cause we don't want, you know, saying, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| my middle school students doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| but they're not doing this at the high school or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| So we want to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| we kind of have a standard way we're going about it, but obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| we always defer to the principals and teachers for common sense to do what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| they need to at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Thank you, Madam chair. I think you've answered Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Ryser. I think you've answered most of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| So I appreciate that you've reached out to principals to ask for a date on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| what is reasonable expectation to come up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| And then just to point out for any teachers who are watching or listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| online 16, number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| it says students submit work via hard copy or virtual formats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| So those kindergarten through second grade grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| particularly that you see saw for instance, as one virtual format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| they could continue to do that because I think that there are younger grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| that are already doing that. So this would allow for that. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Thank you, Ms. Horn. So yes, I think they're there with, within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| so I'm going to try to explain something that's complex and I'm probably not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| the best guy to explain it, but I'll take a shot at it. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| so canvas is our learning management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| There are a lot of different apps and different connections that can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| within kind of that platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| And my understanding is seesaw is one of those things that can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| So you know, we, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| we purchased canvas eight or 10 years ago was kind of the top of the line for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| a learning management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| And the selling point on that was it is a blank canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| You can create whatever you need to do within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| So we do have ways with Teresa Nixon and her team where they really got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| folks to be able to do some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| So I would say if there are schools using certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| probably just to run that through and get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| try to get support through our through Teresa Nixon and her team to see how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| can best utilize that. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| I don't know how everything talks and computes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| but our goal would be not to not to turn everything over for families that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| already understand and know those things. And we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| our answer would try to be, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| there may be a technical reason why certain things wouldn't work. And we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| you know, work through and see how we can do that. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Thank you. Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Yes. I guess my question is, and I mean, we, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| I think a lot of us got feedback last week from some teachers on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| As far as getting lessons up and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| is there any stuff that's going to be district wide done or departmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| done so that we don't have what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| 5,000 different teachers all having to recreate the wheel for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| But maybe there's some disunified lessons that could be used and taken and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| and put up for this math lesson or English or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| I'm just curious if there's that sort of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| I think that's a good question. So we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| we actually have a draft of a document again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| waiting on feedback from some principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| That's about a five page document with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| with lots of links to lots of those types of resources that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| I think what we want to do is give a lot of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| So part of that document right now, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| in draft form is we have some strategies that people might think through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| you know, if I'm in a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| if I'm in a school where there are seven other first grade teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| we might have a common first grade lesson we assigned and I'm doing Mondays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| and you're doing Tuesdays and you're doing Wednesdays and the same thing at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| higher level, multiple biology teachers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| they may divide and conquer because they're kind of in the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| That's one thing they could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Working on lessons that were created last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| those are still available to them in their canvas site to be able to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| those down. And then also there are some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| it's called a canvas commons that Shannon and the teaching and learning team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| are loading and trying to support things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Last year we actually had some teachers that shared to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Some people are really good at being able to understand how to pull that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| and some we know we're going to need to support as they get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| So our ultimate goal is to give multiple options for what people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| comfortable with doing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| But again, I want to be clear there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| there will still be some challenges and some folks at different skill levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| and, and we're not judging that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| We're still in this three year window of trying to figure out how to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| well. So, but, but that's our goal is to have multiple options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And I will say this too, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| kudos to Teresa Nixon and Shannon and their team of central and Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| He's both, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| quickly because we didn't get word back from the state till midnight on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Friday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| help those schools transition to virtual instruction this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| And they all kind of cleared their calendars to be on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| on the ground there at the schools and or available through digital formats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| And I think it has gone pretty well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| even with new teachers that weren't in the district last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| we got reports from them that obviously it was a little more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| because they hadn't done it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| but their peers helping with that as well as the support from the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| office, I think has gone, has gone as well as expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| So as a followup, I mean, is our intention, because it does seem like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| I mean, we don't know when this sort of thing is going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| And I mean, we do have kids that are out sick all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| Is there the thought of having a maintained sort of library in campus that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| could just be used every year and just sort of updated a little bit so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| we don't have to recreate this wheel all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| Thank you, Ms. Bob. Good question. So I think, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| clarify some of what I said last week, that was where we, that was our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| if we could roll the clock back to July, right? I mean, at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| and I know not everyone was there, not a political statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| but just where we were as far as case counts and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| we had just come off a summer of, of summer programming, summer band camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| summer football camps with very little spread that we had at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| So kind of our marching orders at that part where we're kind of open school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| still using some precautions, but somewhat pre COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| like if you want to think about it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| So all of our planning going into July and conversations with principals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| staff were around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| So at the principals Institute was the first time we said exactly what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| alluding to. You know, this is a practice we want to continue moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| This will be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| at the bare minimum campus should continue to be used for makeup work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| And again, not even thinking about COVID resurging at this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| but just that we need to start, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| we need to continue to flex that muscle that we grew last year and build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| it. And I think that, that was a clear expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| Now fast forward to where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| No one thought case counts would be where they are. We understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| for, and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| and I really believe this and talking to some principals that some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| thought was once we realized that the state board policy change restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| our ability to go red as principals and staffs prioritize what's on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| agenda to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| that was kind of moved way down the list because they're going, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| we're not necessarily gonna have to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| So I think that's why when you talk to your principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| you probably get some mixed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| we're ready to go and could have gone yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| We haven't talked about it since July. I get why both are there. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| so, but I do think what you're saying is where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| when all this dust settles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| we want this to be a tool that every parent in Knox County knows to reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| and, and that's where they can find their students assignment, no matter why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| you know, why they missed that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| So there's just a natural part of what we do. But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| that takes some time to get to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| So anything can be used again. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| I've taught a class in Canvas at the university level and that's what I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| every year. I load my, my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| all my content back over to the next class and I replace what I don't want an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| update when I need to, you know, update from there. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| it takes some time to do that, but I'm not recreating it every year to what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you, Dr. Oswick. Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=1852)|

| 0:34:38| So I know some of the founders there and the work that went into that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| to make that large of a gift at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| I mean, I'm thankful for all of our funders and the grants that we get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| announce tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| But to have a new foundation at Austin East and to be able to commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| $40,000 that principal can use is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| We have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Mr. Watson. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2099)|

| 0:36:26| So a motion by Ms. Henderson, second by Ms. Horne. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Because we keep calling this the Northwest Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| is this school going to have a naming? I mean, I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I see the confusion with Northwest Middle School and they're nowhere near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| And so it just kind of concerns me that we keep calling them the same name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| I won't go into the history of why one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| why two schools so far away have a different name or same name, but it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| it's, there's a reason for that. But yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| we will go through a process to name the school at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| And that would probably be subsequent to identifying a principal for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| school. You're back with the North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| That was the Southwest Elementary School project for a number of years until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| we brought on a principal and we can go through a community process to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| you know, with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| with the community of that school to determine what the name is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Okay. Thank you. I just got concerned that it was already being labeled that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| that that was going to stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| And I just felt like there was going to be a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Mr. Oaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| we all know that our costs for construction and across the board are just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| going like crazy. I was buying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| I was trying to buy four metal poles today for a thousand dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| 12 feet. I mean, it's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| And I know that oftentimes architectural costs is directly tied to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| percentage is 5.62% standard in our contracts or contractual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| contractual costs, architectural costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| The architectural costs are set by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| And it's a percent of the project. I'd have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| for the details on that I'd have to defer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| That's okay. I mainly wanted to know that it was standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| So it's set by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| There is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| there is a standard process to go through and it's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| it's a calculation that is made and there's not a lot of leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| What's driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| what's driving this is the fact that we've got increased contract costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| So the architects get a bigger share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| So we have a motion by Miss Henderson and a second by Miss Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| I'm all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| TNC approved fund balance designation in the amount of $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| So motion by Miss Bounds, a second by Mr. Millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Mr. Oaks, just because it changed between last week's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Can you just speak to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| the detail that was provided for tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Yeah. And I'll talk to my piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| $2 million of this $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| $90,000 is related to the Gibbs project and our need to put in an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2368)|
| 0:39:36| portable classroom at Hardin Valley Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| We're funded for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| We need two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| And so that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| that's why we're asking for $400,000 out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| And then $1.6 million is for the increased contract costs for path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| construction on the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| It's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| it's significantly higher than what we budgeted several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| And so this will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| this will get us to where we can cover those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| So we have a motion by Ms. Bounds, a second by Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| So we'll turn to Vice Chair, Ms. Satterfield for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2422)|

| 0:41:44| he has not been able to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| He did start with Knox County School System two years ago at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Cedar Bluff Preschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| when COVID-19 first hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| I was just as concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| as any more other parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| After a while and listening to doctors and specialists that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| see regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| and the CDC continually saying that this virus did not affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| children like it did adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| I was obviously less concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Alec did catch COVID-19 and was asymptomatic with no problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| defeating the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| At the start of this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| I was willing to work within the guidelines to help stop the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| spread of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| here we are over a year later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| and we've obviously been unsuccessful in doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| something that we have accomplished with the stress of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| mask mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| regular school closings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| and sending kids home with showing any sort of illness for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| fear it's COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| is causing my son to regress exponentially in his social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| basic education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Alec has had severe sensory discomfort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| a sensory disorder that causes him extreme stress when he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| around loud noises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| touches a texture he does not like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| or has things on his body he does not want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| such as shoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| hats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| So you can imagine the fight that it was to try and keep a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| mask on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| I could see the emotional toll it was taking on my son as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Alec's school continually tried to force him to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Alec is nonverbal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| he does not understand the need for a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I understand that it was this board's decision to allow kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| with special needs the option to opt out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| continually throughout the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| it was continually pushed by teachers and other school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| This was not only detrimental to his education and mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| but caused a level of distrust within teachers and those with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Alec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| who was supposed to be guiding him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Alec was sent home 18 times last school year because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| school claimed that he was sick and he would not wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| At one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| I was being called to pick him up multiple times a week due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| what the staff said was a fever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| Finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| I went into the school to pick him up and ask them to take his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| temperature in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| I waited over 15 minutes for the nurse to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| take his temperature two different times on two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| thermometers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| only for his temperature to be 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| even after I proved that he did not have a fever and was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| showing no other symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| and that this was only about the teachers and staff wanting him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| to wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| even with his disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| he would still sit home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| This was brought to the attention of the preschool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| director and the primary school principal with no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| my son's preschool was closed for 54 days due to COVID and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| the cleaning schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| This means that out of a total of 184 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| he should have been in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| He was not offered any services or education for 72 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| That is almost 40% of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| My son was unable to do online learning as his mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| disability does not allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| He still receives physical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| occupational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| and speech therapy through the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| due to closures and not having enough therapists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Alec did not receive the amount of therapy that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| discussed in what was supposed to be under his IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| At the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| they had to change the number of hours of each therapy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| have me sign a new IEP just so it did not look like they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| not followed through with the amount of therapy he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| supposed to receive with the original one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| I understand you are trying to do what you think is best for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2691)|

| 0:45:02| I apologize for the inconvenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| when schools do inevitably close this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| you keep one or two schools open for children who are unable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| to do online learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Ask teachers to volunteer to work with these kids who will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| otherwise once be left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| If schools continue to close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| like my sons did last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| hire enough therapists to make sure they are still receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| the amount of therapy listed in their IEP as his insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| would no longer cover therapy since he was supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| receiving it through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| I know I would be willing to drive Alec to any school that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| would be willing to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| I know I would be willing to drive Alec to any school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| no matter where in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| to ensure he gets the education that he deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| I urge you to consider these kids with disabilities in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| decisions you make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| The mandates and guidelines this Board approves affects kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| like my son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| and unfortunately he always seems to be forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| If you conclude you must enforce a mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| please make sure that children who cannot wear them are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| forced to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Have an open line of communication for complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| with upper school board members when schools do try to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| kids like my son wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| And find a reasonable solution to allow my son the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| education he deserves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| and with other children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| I urge you do not forget my son this year when making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| and remember that all children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| no matter the abilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| deserve the right to have an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2772)|

| 0:47:08| that I have with school lockers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| Currently my daughter is in sixth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| and she does not have an access to a locker because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| at Powell Middle School they have decided to zip-tie them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2836)|

| 0:47:30| acceptable by any pediatrician. I know last year it was due to COVID and the emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2850)|

| 0:47:44| lockers. Other schools are not allowing lockers. The Powell Middle School has a huge neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2864)|

| 0:48:00| day we were riding in a van with a school board member at the PTAMN and we noticed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2880)|
| 0:48:07| kid put a backpack on, steered the bike, fell down. Backpack was too heavy, trying transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2887)|
| 0:48:16| What I'm trying to say here is that you have to have some kind of uniform policy. If parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2896)|
| 0:48:23| are sending their kids to doctors or chiropractors, which I know they did last year, then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| to have some kind of common ground of maybe during COVID that's acceptable, but we cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| have some school principals the flexibility to shut down taxpayer lockers and others not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2915)|
| 0:48:43| When we were given an option of something else, the administration at Powell Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| School said, you can get a rolling backpack and you can roll it around. How many students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| in Knox County do not have access to the money to buy one backpack, two backpacks? Well guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| what happened when my daughter at sixth grade bought a backpack? She got made fun of. She| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| got bullied. Why? Because we all know, I'm an educator, they're different, right? When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| you're a little bit different, you're a little bit different and people make fun of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| And so that was a result. So it's unacceptable that a solution requires money out of people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| pocket and that it requires that somehow you get made fun of. Those two things are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| acceptable in my book. It's not acceptable that Halls Elementary or Middle School, Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| Elementary School have access to their lockers. They are no less of a discipline problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| than Powell Middle School because that's what we're told over and over again, the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| why they don't have access. Because during COVID they found masking up children, sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| down a hallway one way was less discipline. And they got to class faster. And they support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2991)|
| 0:49:59| let's not give them lockers again. You want to know why? Because there's less drama in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| the hallways and they have quicker response time and more classroom time. Well if I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| growing up, it was a privilege going to middle school where I had access to my locker for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| the first time. And I was allowed to socialize and be a social being. I'm a high school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3017)|
| 0:50:25| We can't just have kids not socializing in the hallways in middle school and then send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| them to high school where they just have leaps and bounds of like they can talk, they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| be on their cell phones. It's the ease of teachers and discipline down the hallway which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| is keeping these lockers locked. And we want as a community for you to pass some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| legislation that says, hey, unless if there's an emergency, kids have opportunities to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| backpacks and books in a locker and walk home or do whatever they need to do. But born out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3055)|

| 0:51:25| And maybe we don't understand what's going on with there was nothing ever mentioned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| COVID. And maybe like lining kids up down the hallways and being quiet is easier, but not at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3090)|
| 0:51:38| the detriment of our kids backs and policies and causing people to get backpacks and having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| parents send their kids to the chiropractor. I just feel like that's ripe for a lawsuit if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| that continues on. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3110)|

| 0:52:10| 37923 for 16 years. I'm here today as a parent of two children who are under 12 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| who should be going to blue glass elementary school, but who are not. And as the vice chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| of KCS pass, the parent advocates for school safety. And I first would just like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| that there are many parents who are extremely concerned about the dashboard. They're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| because there are wildly different numbers on the KCS dashboard, the numbers reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| by KCHD and the numbers reported by the Tennessee Department of Health. The disparities of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| numbers have caused a lot of concern among parents. They're asking that there be individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| school dashboards with two simple data points, student absences and teacher absences for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| each school. So if something could be made possible to provide that information, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| be very helpful as parents make their decisions regarding their children, their children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| education, their children's safety. When I called yesterday to sign up to speak, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| told that the issue of mitigation measures to keep our schools safe during the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| was not on the agenda. And I had known that to be the case. I didn't expect that to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| on the agenda this evening. I was surprised when I was told yesterday that the emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| meeting last week about mitigation measures was called in order to put the issue to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| That surprised me that it was phrased that way. And I actually found out from another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| parent that that wasn't the only, I wasn't the only person who was told that. If that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| was the goal, the majority of the members of this board, I think that that failed. Since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| your decision on August 11th and your decision again last week, not to implement the mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| measures that have been recommended by the CDC and the Tennessee Department of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| the situation has continued to get worse than it was in August. You have not put this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| rest. Several teachers have simply resigned as a result. One teacher at Cedar Bluff Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| School who was taught at Knox County schools for 16 years, reluctantly resigned yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| because you failed to provide a safe work environment. She has a weakened immune system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| and can no longer take being afraid coming to work. Yesterday you wrote a letter, at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| least it was dated yesterday, to Governor Lee. And I do understand that it's been characterized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| in different ways publicly and that there is some issue about the way it's been characterized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| But one part of my own concern, having read that letter, was the way in which you somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| you present yourself as somehow champions of in-person learning. Your actions since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| the beginning of August resulted in mass absences, school buses being delayed 30 minutes, 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| minutes, 50 minutes, over 50 minutes. Two high schools in KCS having to close their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3303)|

| 0:55:18| will continue to be extremely difficult for teachers because they were not prepared for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| virtual learning. The many problems that have quickly become so evident have also come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3322)|
| 0:55:30| the attention of the Tennessee Commissioner of Education, Penny Schwinn, who wrote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3330)|

| 0:55:41| I came to a meeting of this board on August 4th. Just before school started, she encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3341)|

| 0:56:18| this board's meeting on August 4th expecting to hear that you'd be implementing those mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| measures and I was very surprised when you did not. Before your meeting on August 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210908?start=3383)|
