| 0:03:37| 7A is a report of mayor's council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| I've got a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| Real quick, three or four things on the mayor's report, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| First of all, I'd like to ask David Brace, who's our – David, if you'd come down to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| We'd love to brag on you just for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| David has been awarded the Ed Archer Young Public Works Leader of the Year Award during the recent 2008 conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| of the Tennessee chapter of the Public Works Association in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| It's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| Two or three key criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| You have to be an individual that, over their young professional career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| they've contributed to the advancement of public works, which David has done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| They must be active in the association works across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| And you also have to be 35 years or younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| I actually don't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| I'm 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Maybe when you were 35, you still were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| But anyway, that's a big honor, David, and really for you, but also for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| I think it reflects the great job you've done since you've taken over public works for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| and even before that as the deputy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| So on behalf of the city, I think there's somewhere there's an award here for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| but I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| So I'm hoping you already have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| But anyway, congratulations on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| I did want all of council and other folks to realize that that's a big deal for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| and we very much appreciate and congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Now, I just wonder, David, why those of us who work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| and know you are not a bit surprised about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| I don't feel as young as the award is supposed to make me feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| A few other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Just remember during the cooler weather, one of our great city treasures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| the Knoxville Zoo has zoo's penguin discount days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| half-price admissions for all zoo guests through Saturday, February 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| So take advantage of the cold weather and go for half price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| I want to salute two other significant kind of milestones for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| This Thursday kicks off the 100th birthday celebration for the Bisou Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| They have a tremendous line of performances starting really Thursday through the weekend to celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| And on Wednesday at 5.30, we're celebrating the new market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| the lighting of the new slash old marquee for the Bisou Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| So the Bisou opened to a packed house back on March 8th, 1909,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| with a performance of the musical Little Johnny Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| And it's been a big part of the city's life for over 100 or for 100 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| It's an important part of the heart of downtown Knoxville, so I want to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| Finally, the last thing on the mayor's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| I'd like to ask Superintendent Dale Dittmanson of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| As you all know, and there's a banner here celebrating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| this is the 75th anniversary of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| and the superintendent would love to make a quick report for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| I sure appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Members of the council, I appreciate the opportunity to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| We do have a big anniversary, not quite the 100 years of the Bisou,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| but 75 years of Great Smoky Mountains National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| I think some of you are probably aware of the anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| I hope all of you saw Sunday's New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| There was a wonderful series of articles about the anniversary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| and some of the dates and a list of many of the important citizens of Knoxville in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| that had a lot to do with the creation of this national park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| The park was established on June 15th, 1934,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| and it's here only because of the citizens of East Tennessee and Western North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| We remember that each and every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| and we want to take this anniversary as an opportunity to say thank you for the fact that this park was established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| It took a few years for the idea to gel, actually, from the turn of the century to the 1920s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| but eventually in 1934, June 15th, the park was established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| and actually a little over a year later, over 400,000 acres that had been acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| by the states of Tennessee and North Carolina were deeded to the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| We have two goals for the 75th anniversary, the first of which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| I've already touched on, a celebration of our heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| this rich heritage that this mountain place was a special place to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| and that the people took the effort to save it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| and secondly, that heritage of the mountain families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| and people that perhaps at least in the 1930s wished the park wasn't here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| because many families were forced to move from their land and displaced and moved in other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| and so we want to recognize that sacrifice as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| Third, it's a celebration of stewardship because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| the citizens saw this wonderful place, felt it needed to be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| That stewardship was enforced through almost ten years of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s up to 1940s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=495)|
| 0:08:23| and that legacy of stewardship continues today with the Friends of the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| I know many here were part of the Evergreen Ball with the Friends of the Smokies on Friday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| and we appreciate that support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| but we also have a great Smoky Mountains Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| and over 2,000 park volunteers that make this national park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| and all we do for our visitors possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| I'm here tonight for two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| One, I've started on already, and that is to say thank you to the citizens of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| and in particular, in this case, to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| and all the deep roots that are here in the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| and secondly, to invite the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| and the council members to some significant events that are coming up this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Of course, the public is invited to these events as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| The first that I'd like you to place on your calendar is April 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| It is a Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| and that day we intend to have the two governors of North Carolina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| and Tennessee together up on Clingman's Dome Road on top of the mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| in a ceremony to recognize the states again for the establishment of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| and we're inviting each of the counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| each of the cities to add their proclamation to the governor's proclamations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| We'd love to have a whole wall of them that will become part of the permanent archives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| of the collection of the park, recognizing again the citizens of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| and the communities for this park being established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| That's at noon, Friday, April 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| The second is a series of events over the weekend of June 13th, 14th, and 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| The closest to you here is Kate's Cove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| where we will have the Knoxville Symphony playing at the back of the cove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| in what we hope will be a wonderful day of celebration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| celebrations around sugar lands at Gatlinburg on the 14th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| and near Cherokee on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| And finally, there's a famous photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| It was in the paper on Sunday of FDR on top of the mountain dedicating the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| It actually occurred in 1940,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| and our hope is that we can recreate that event with the current president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| We're working many angles to see if that invitation might be accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| and to have a wonderful event there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| and we would love, again, for the city to be recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| and participate in that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| Just as a note of interest, many people do not realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| that FDR is the last sitting president to be inside Great Smoky Mountains National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| So we think after this many years, it's time to have that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| I brought a couple things along this evening to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| Maybe I'll just start it on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| You can pass them around, which have the events in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| a press release on significant things happening this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| And, again, thank you for allowing me a few minutes to talk about the anniversary of this special place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| that is the backdrop for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Thanks, Sid Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| It's also worth noting that when it started, I think a lot of people know this history, but they were stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| They couldn't find the money to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| And the first people that offered up property for sale, the lumber companies owned most of what's now the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| was the Little River Lumber Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| But nobody had the funds to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| The Rockefeller money hadn't come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| There was no federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| And the city of Knoxville stepped up and said to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| we'll pay a third if you'll pay the other two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| That was basically they bought what was to take the towns and entrance to the park all the way up through Tremont| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| up to the top of the mountain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| And the city of Knoxville put up $90,000, which was a whole lot of money then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| And the state put up the other $180,000 for that first $270,000, which they paid $3 an acre for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| So, pretty good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| But, anyway, Dale, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| We appreciate you and all that the park does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=701)|
| 0:11:51| Seven A is report of Mayor's Council on Disability Issues regarding the abandonment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| of comprehensive lift services for citizens of Knoxville with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| May I ask if we're going to have council reports, or are we going to have them later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| We can do either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| We do have --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Let me suggest something, and maybe we'll come to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| This is a report from the Mayor's Council on Disability Issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| As such, it's not set up in our typical forum where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| three people speak and have five minutes, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Now, on the other hand, we have a lot of folks who have come here tonight to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| and have things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| I have a proposal to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| I guess, technically, following the rules, they would have to wait until public forum to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| which is the end of the meeting, which I think is a little impractical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| I would like to suggest to council that we go ahead and there's several people that decided to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| And there's a 30-minute total time limit that we let folks speak as many as we can get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| And I'd propose that we have a 20-minute total time limit to let as many people speak as can now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| We would change our rules, so to speak, to let them speak now rather than having to wait till the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| And do it like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| There's not a typical format for dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| I ran this by the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I obviously didn't have time to talk to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| But that's a proposal that I'd make for how to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| Councilman Huckabay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| I'll make that a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=791)|
| 0:13:11| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Would we pick up the last ten minutes of public forum at the end if there are folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| We will still have our normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| This is an additional to regular public forum, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| So the regular rules would still apply to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I'm asking for 20 minutes just so folks who don't want to wait two hours or whatever till council is over can go now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| I also want to let you know, typically, the west bank of elevators closes at night, but they are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| Anybody that needs to use the west bank of elevators, those are open tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| PBA took care of that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| So, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| We didn't vote, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| There are a list of folks signed up, and I understand that these are signed up in the order that I think there was some order to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| Cindy told me so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Starting with Jamie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| Jamie Rowe is signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Otis Stevens on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| And if everybody would just give us your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| I'm going to go start a total time clock of 20 minutes, and then we'll go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| May I say something before we begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| As council knows, I am the council rep to the KTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| And I wanted to clarify something that is on our cover sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Our cover sheet basically says that on July 24th, KTA approved CAT's request to reduce the lift service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| when, in fact, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| We postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| And Don Sprouls, who was the chair at the time, looked over the minutes and reviewed the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| I don't recall us ever approving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| And so the clarification is that this was an administrative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| This was not because in all fairness, KTA did not recommend to either do it or not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=899)|
| 0:15:09| There was lots of concern, and a lot of concern from me about not so much bringing the lift back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=909)|
| 0:15:19| into a reasonable alignment with the ADA requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| but that we would take care of those people who were currently outside of that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| So, anyway, clarification one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| We did not approve this, as this cover letter states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| So I think it's important for people to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| This was an action by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| And I understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| These are very tough times, and we have to make some tough choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| However, I do still believe that we need to take care of the people who have already made those kinds of choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=954)|
| 0:16:05| to live in places that the new action would not cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| And to give someone six months to move within the range of what lift will accommodate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=970)|
| 0:16:22| in these economic times, it's just, you know, that's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| So my personal position is that while I do understand we need to make some really tough decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| and KTA is all on board with making tough decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| I think we need to take care of the people who are currently using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| I mean, we established the opportunity for them to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| If you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you, Mayor and City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Just for clarification, there are two officers here from COTI tonight specifically to address the white paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| My name is Tom Kaler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| My professional address is 900 East Hill Avenue here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| And I will quickly give our position on the white paper and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| It is indeed a milestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| As we're noting the part, this is COTI's or in this permutation catch previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| this is our 25th year of service to the mayor and to the city council and to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| And under the approval of the city liaison, I'm here to speak on the city white paper or the COTI white paper today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| Specifically, I just want to note that this venue is all fitting and proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| and we're certainly tickled to be able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| and present this issue to you in as clear and concise a way as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| I want to speak to economic impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Without the extensive research, we really have a difficult time at deriving the precise economic cost to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| But we do know that it's invariable that there will be loss of jobs resulting in loss of purchasing power in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| and, as a result, loss of sales tax and revenues, loss of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| potentially resulting in increased burden on public housing and other social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| There is a lack of affordable, accessible housing already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| so that it's difficult for people to even think about relocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| And it will increase an economic burden on family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| and a consequential decrease in economic contribution from that segment of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| These economic impacts must be calculated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| and cannot be calculated just limited to the lost wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| but to the resulting costs that cascade throughout the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| when a person with a disability is no longer financially able to remain independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| Secondly, I want to talk about some of the potential legal implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| With the assistance of the University of Tennessee Legal Clinic, we reviewed some of the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| specifically the fact that the city has set some historical precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| and that, second, ending them might illegally target that subset of Knoxville citizens who are people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| If the city accepts the proposal to eliminate comprehensive lift service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| it may actually be in violation of the ADA, which specifically forbids actions that have a disparate impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1161)|
| 0:19:30| Ostensibly, the city cannot now eliminate that service just because it would be focused solely on a community of people with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| when no other class of persons, able or otherwise, is being singled out specifically in such a manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| In the white paper, you'll note that there are supporting case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| I don't want to go into too much detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| I do want to save our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Specifically, the cuts have a particular exclusionary effect on people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| They're not neutral on their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| A cut which would be neutral would, for example, be a 10 percent across-the-board cut in all services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| And we don't want services cut for anybody, but we do understand the economic tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| Also, the people with disabilities will not be able to meaningfully benefit from those coverage limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| That's clear on its face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| And there are no identical and effective services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| There are no CAC is not going to pick up the slack where cat leaves off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| Cat is too valuable and too effective at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| There are other supporting case laws that speak to adverse disparate impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| and where there were qualified plaintiffs who were denied benefits just due to a lack of funding that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| The circuit's court stated that in the ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| it was intended to ensure qualified individuals received services in a manner consistent with basic human dignity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| rather than a manner that shuns them aside, hides or ignores them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| I think we all also know a lot about the ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| and we wonder whether disparate impact actually affects our class of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| In this case, we say that it does because people are being excluded from participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| and are being denied benefits or being subjected to discrimination that exhibits adverse disparate impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| Now, in a quick legal summary, and Cody does not presuppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| and I'm not here to represent this as a legal document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| but there is a possible legal implication of federal and supporting case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| In a larger context, Cody wishes simply to make the mayor aware of the implications for people with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| who will be effectively denied access to city services, employment, healthcare, food, banking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| places of worship, shopping, recreations, meetings such as this tonight, and to the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| Cuts to the CAT Lift service may constitute a discrimination by subjecting people with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| who live inside the city of Knoxville to the adverse disparate impact previously mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| while maintaining routes that are outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| Cody recognizes the need for budget cuts and the reprioritization during economic hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| For both these legal and humane reasons, however, Cody opposes budget cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| that disparately affect people with disabilities while prioritizing service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| for people outside the mandated CAT transit area at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| Our second officer is behind me and would like to speak just to a couple other aspects of the legal paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| Again, I appreciate your time and thoughtfulness, and Mayor, you're allowing us to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| If you'd give us a name and address, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| I'm Bill Dockery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| I live at 4615 Holston Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| I'm the secretary of Cody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| I work at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| I rise to address two points in the white paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| There are three points left, I guess, but one of them, the humane effects of the non-decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| that Councilman Woodhull referred to will probably be addressed by the people behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| I want to mention at one point the documentation of the need for this change was not made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1381)|
| 0:23:10| in the documents that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| It was the documentation was confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| It did not bear out the implications that it was supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| And we find that with the mission of CAT being to serve the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| our concern is that we are leaving out people in the city of Knoxville while serving people outside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1409)|
| 0:23:37| So that's one major concern that we surfaced in our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| My own personal biggest concern as a resident of Knoxville since 1980| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| and as a native East Tennessean is that I believe our reputation as a livable city is at issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| Historically, we've won prizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Even back in the 60s, we were known as an all-American city, as one of the most livable cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| CAT itself, our transportation system, has been recognized within the last five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| or six years as an outstanding transportation system for a city this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| But now we're in the process of drawing some lines that are probably inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| I've been a member, as I said, I've been here since 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| and I've seen us wrestle with whether we wanted to be a unified government or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| My position has always been I like being in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| It's sort of like being a part of a country club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| We get better services than the regular folk do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| We get better police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| We get better fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| We get better transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And now we're proposing to do away with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| The purpose of this city is to make life better for the people who live within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| This is a step away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| The effect of not having a comprehensive lift program for peoples with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| weakens not only their lives, but the fabric of the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Thanks, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| I don't think we're going by the list that was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| The next person I had on the list was Otis Stevens or Nick Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| I'm not certain if there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1526)|
| 0:25:38| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| I'm Lillian Burch, and I hope that you don't count the 20 minutes against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| We won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Cody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| They are your counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you very much, Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| We appreciate this opportunity very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| And let me identify myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| I'm Otis Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| I live in Knoxville at 1141 Southgate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| I am a regular user of the CAT system and recently have begun to use the lift service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| But I'm here not so much for myself because this cut would not directly affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| I'm within the three-quarter mile limit that I believe is the dividing line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| But I am here to speak in support of other people with disabilities in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| who will be adversely affected by this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Transportation is a major problem for people with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| not just visually impaired people, but people in wheelchairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| people who for various reasons cannot drive an automobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| who do not have access to private transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| And it is very important for these people to be able to move about independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| to go to doctor's appointments, to do grocery shopping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| to do daily living requirements that rely heavily upon transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1625)|
| 0:27:15| This population of people with disabilities also is growing rapidly in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| so that although we have perhaps today only some 44 to 45 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| who would be adversely affected by this decision immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| that number will increase as time goes by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| and as this population of people with disabilities increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| People really do depend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| For employment, for example, on being able to get to and from their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| Banking is another point that Tom Kaler mentioned a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| which is very important for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| Being able to go to and from church, being able to grocery shop, do laundry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| just any number of reasons why people with disabilities who do not have ready access to family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| or friends who can do all the driving that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| would be adversely affected by this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| And as a member of the Board of Directors of the Disability Resource Center here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| I'm very concerned about this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| And I am hopeful that we can work out some method to address the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| before the service is reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Once it is reduced, it's very hard to reestablish this kind of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| So I would urge you to consider ways to essentially ameliorate this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1719)|
| 0:28:49| to remove it if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| but certainly not to make a decision right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| that would take this service away from many people who need it badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you again for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| The next name I have is Nick Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| I'm not sure I have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| My name is Nick Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| I live at 2333 Highland Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| I'm here tonight actually to speak on behalf of my cousin, Kenny Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| Kenny is an individual with disabilities, both physical, cognitive, and developmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1766)|
| 0:29:35| My cousin also takes the CAT Lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| He's been actually one of the first certified individuals with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| to have started riding the CAT Lift when the CAT Lift actually first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| Now his lift is actually being taken away from him if this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| This is ultimately an act of discrimination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| segregation of all people with disabilities in the city of Knoxville who are being affected by this CAT Lift cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| All I can ask is to urge you to think about this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| If you know somebody with a disability, physical, cognitive, developmental, anything such as that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| if you know somebody with a disability, a family friend, just think about this and contemplate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Thank you very much and have a good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1820)|
| 0:30:46| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| I'm Catherine Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1847)|
| 0:30:47| I just recently moved to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| I'm at 2252 Peter Drive in the Fox Burleson Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| I can stand here, you know, and give you all the moral issues, the rights and wrongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| And I would just like to bring up maybe one or two points that haven't been stated yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| We've been hearing numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| First we've heard 33 would be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Then we heard there's 44 riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| And I will be proud to be quoted as saying we are getting so much mixed information from CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| and I don't know if it's intentional or if it's not intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| I'm not here to blame or point fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| What I would like to see is a cohesion of what the CAT staff knows what the budget's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| because I have talked to people in the city and talked to people at CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| and I am getting all kinds of conflicted numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| The 124,800, that's what it costs annually to run CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| That's what we're going to save to run, you know, if we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| We're just getting so much conflicted information from the people that are involved themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| I would really like to see solid numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| We were told last night at the meeting we met several people in the city that the paper that they gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| in the July meeting is what we could go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| However, it was also stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| that those figures were because of the gas prices in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| which the gas prices have drastically dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| So that, you know, I don't know if that makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| What I'd like to say, though, is as far as the 33 or 44 or however many that they claim is going to be affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| that is not a true number at all whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| For example, I'm not trying to make it a personal note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| but I want to use myself because I know what will happen if I do lose the CAT service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| I just recently resigned from my job at the Disability Resource Center so I could help my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| and their husband with their two grandchildren so I could keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| I can no longer get to where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| It will affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| They may have to find a new babysitter with whom they would have to pay to keep the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| I can't get easily to my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| I would be a helpful caregiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| That will affect my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| If I was working, the employees who ride the Lyft, if they lose their jobs, that will affect their employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| They will have to hire somebody else, pay them, you know, to be trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| That will affect the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| They will have to pick up the slack as far as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| having to do their job while their boss is trying to find someone to fill the employee who's lost their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| because they can't get their ride to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| The whole community is going to be affected, not just these 33 or 44 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| And that's such an unfair, such an unfair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| It's just ridiculous to ask somebody to move to a spot where they will be three-quarters of a mile to a bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2012)|
| 0:33:42| because as I have worked with CAT many times, I have been a bus trainer for years with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| And I will be the first to rave how wonderful CAT works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| I will be the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| The Lyft service is absolutely excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| They run it so smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| And I've trained the bus drivers, and so I know what goes on within CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| But this, I'm sorry, I've lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| But this is just going to affect so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| And I just want you to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| It's going to affect the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| And like it was stated further, this city, I remember, Mayor Hanselman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| when you were talking about forward Knoxville, and you would even quote, you know, forward Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| We want Knoxville to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| This is not forward Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| This is not forward Knoxville one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| And I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| I am not naive to the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| I am not naive to the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| None of us are saying, no, it doesn't cost that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| We're not debating the numbers as far as the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| But to put a person and their family on a piece of paper in black and white in numbers and cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2081)|
| 0:34:49| that's making it easier for us all to sleep tonight, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| And it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| It's faces and families and people in our city and our children, our grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| So please think about this before you make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| I do appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Joyce Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2107)|
| 0:35:19| I'm Joyce Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| I've been around a long time, but I haven't been to city council in a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| and I see a lot of different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| I have a daughter with autism, and that's how I got into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| And we could have told the first night that she was at home from the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| that there was something wrong with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| And it seems that at that point even the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2147)|
| 0:35:56| We finally got a young man in town at the birth defect center who had worked with children with autism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| and things began to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| By three, Joanne was in a program at Lakeshore for children with autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| And later on became the first one in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| And then they used her as a person at the University of Tennessee to work with in order to get a grant from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2182)|
| 0:36:32| Department of Education in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| And she has been in the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Early on was in the paper a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| And as a result, I was asked to become -- we were asked to form Autism Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| And in 1977, the mayor, Tyree, had promised that he would set up an office for the handicapped, and he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2207)|
| 0:37:01| And somehow I got invited to this and became the chairperson eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| And over time I have -- and that's been about 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| I have been an advocate for children with disabilities in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| And I just wanted you to know that background because we did set up the Advisory Council for the Handicapped and Elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2239)|
| 0:37:34| And we began to see things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| And I hate to see -- and what we did, we set up a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| and the committee decided that transportation was the most important thing in this city for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2266)|
| 0:37:55| And there were several young men at UT who were in wheelchairs who were very adamant about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2275)|
| 0:38:04| And eventually a group designed the lift, and then it took off, and it's been doing very well since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2284)|
| 0:38:16| In fact, I threatened the city because of the fact that they were not providing any very -- they were providing very little services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| I think they had an organization that was taking people to the doctors, but that was all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| And that would be discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| I loved the fact that at the time that I did this, I had no idea that my daughter would ever ride it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2317)|
| 0:38:51| But, in fact, when she got out of high school, we had to force the rehab center by going to Washington to look for a job for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2331)|
| 0:39:04| And, of course, I knew where the job was for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| And to provide her with a job, we finally got the St. Mary's Medical Center to give some funding to the Cerebral Palsy Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2348)|
| 0:39:22| to fund a program at St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| And she worked there for 12 years, and then suddenly her job disappeared whenever they started restructuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2366)|
| 0:39:35| And the only -- my husband said they must have outsourced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| So we don't know what happened, but she is no longer riding the lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| But I am concerned about the other young people who really need the lift and they don't have a way to get to jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| and to get to the doctor and to get to various places in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| I wanted to say that because I think that many times people who aren't around people with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2399)|
| 0:40:07| don't realize the kinds of things we have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| And we could look for another job for Joanne, and we could probably get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| But, you know, I am so disgusted with having to do all the things we have to do to get a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| or to get various things that is needed that I have not ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| I've sort of fallen back and have not been doing what I should be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| And, you know, I wanted to have a little fun for a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| So we have not been as ---- haven't been out in the public as much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| but we've been doing things in regards to health care and education that needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2452)|
| 0:41:00| and can do that from our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| And remember that sometimes your child may need to ride the lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| I believe I saw Cindy McGinnis here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| This would be an appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| Cindy is ---- would you like her to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| As she comes forward, I'd like to point out to Council, I don't pretend to have known all the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| but having an undergraduate degree in political science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| I'd be remiss to point out Dr. Stevens is one of the great professors at the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| And also Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| And also Bill Dockery is a very accomplished writer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| You know, I was thinking about this last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| I've been out of town for a while, and I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| I think the lift service is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| I even think my wife's late grandfather used the lift a time or two to get to kidney dialysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2515)|
| 0:42:03| What I was thinking about last night as I was lying in bed and just getting back in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| having had a chance to talk to people, trying to come up with a way we can address the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| where hopefully we can maintain as close to the status quo as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| Here's a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| It might not be a good idea, but it's a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Correct me if I'm wrong, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| You have to call to set up an appointment with lift a few days in advance, some time in advance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2548)|
| 0:42:36| That's correct, one day in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Is it possible in, you know, I understand budgetary shortfalls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| and this is not a topic any of us are wanting to discuss, to set up a fair FARE system that is based on distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2563)|
| 0:42:56| Like, for example, if you're in, for sake of argument, want to go one mile within where you would be picked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2576)|
| 0:43:07| your FARE would be X dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| If you want to go five miles away, your FARE would be X plus Y dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| And the further you go, the FARE would increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| You know, I don't pretend that to be a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| I'm just trying to think of some way that we can, like I said, preserve this as close to the status quo as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| as well as being fiscally responsible to the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Because when the people are calling in advance, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| obviously they have to give their address that they're going to be picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| And you can, you know, pick MapQuest, pick Google Maps or whatever and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| you're going, for sake of argument, ten miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| And the FARE, for sake of argument, is $20 each way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| Or if you're going only two miles, the FARE, for sake of argument, is $5 each way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| Some way, you know, that we can try to help bridge this gap to provide this service to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| Because, you know, as much as you like to encourage public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| I was just thinking I was on CAT probably within the past two weeks riding the trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| You know, and I'd be remiss not to thank Councilman Woodhull for helping to convince the town of Farragut last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| to help contribute $10,000 to the express that goes to Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| But I don't mean to be impolite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| This is the city of Knoxville's bus system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| I know, you know, a number of months ago, last year, there was a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| and we were discussing the Halls Express, the Farragut Express, and I believe the CAT Lyft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| And I think a member of county commission even offered his salary to help pay for the Halls Express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| He offered some fund that he receives from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| And we billed him and we did receive what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| That's great to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Back to the Lyft, is it possible to consider a zone-based fare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Outside of the three-quarter mile radius that we've been talking about establishing as the service boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| Outside of that area, we can charge a premium fare for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| Within that boundary, we can only charge twice what our normal fixed route fare is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| Currently, our normal fixed route fare is $1.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| So a one-way Lyft trip within the three-quarter boundary can be no more than $3.00 by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| But outside of that three-quarter mile service area boundary, we can charge a premium fare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| Can you all explore that fairly quickly to see if that's something that can be implemented to try to preserve Lyft as much as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2751)|
| 0:46:00| We certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Councilwoman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Oh, that's for a report later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| No, I was just going to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| It takes me back to a comment Councilman Woodhull made early when he was speaking before the other speakers came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2776)|
| 0:46:28| And it seems to meet with approval with some of those who were listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| You know, I have to go back to the comment you made, Councilwoman Woodhull, that people chose to live where they felt this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2794)|
| 0:46:42| service was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| I somehow have a problem that they chose to live there because they believed they had made a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2807)|
| 0:46:56| And at the time they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| And I understand all about the financial constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Believe me, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| I think we all do in our personal lives aside from this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| But I have a real problem charging people more because they did make a different choice on where to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| I have a serious problem in making a difference with anyone within the city who needs these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2834)|
| 0:47:24| And I don't have all the answers, but I haven't done a lot of thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| And I seriously would like some more opportunities for some more possibilities to be brought to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| Because, you know, this is seven years to have the opportunity to be on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2855)|
| 0:47:44| And really it probably goes back to nine years ago when I met many of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| And that lovely dog out there that I'm just so in love with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| But I understand she's 13, so she goes back much longer than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| But, you know, your faces and your stories and your needs are just something I can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2879)|
| 0:48:09| I don't feel that I can dismiss easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I appreciated every phone call that I received this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| And some were very interesting because they really did give me an opportunity to think a great deal more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2896)|
| 0:48:24| And to hear what I needed to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| I'm in favor of buying some time somehow to see if there is any way that we can come to what I consider to be a more equitable solution regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2913)|
| 0:48:45| And maybe we don't find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| But I personally would feel remiss if I didn't have the opportunity to be a bit more involved in looking for a way to make this work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2928)|
| 0:49:00| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| I guess two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Just one, just for clarity's sake, for people watching at home, we're actually not going to be voting on this particular service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| This is something that, I mean, Mr. Woodall pointed out that apparently the CAT Board didn't vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| And just to be clear, we're not voting on it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| So for anybody who's watching, you know, we're not voting to approve this at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| And I guess there's a challenge in sort of what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| I mean, I agree with the need to continue this up to serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| I'm kind of interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I got this little handout here from the Disability Resources Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| And it actually, the last line of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| and I'm wondering if there's somebody who can explain a little more what they mean by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| We request the Community Transportation Study Group to explore options, which I think I sort of get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Somebody can just talk a minute about what are some ways to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| I think Mr. Frost has got some interesting ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| And there are obviously some thoughts on how we can do better on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| But to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Lillian, if you could speak to that real briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Yes, I'm Lillian Birch from Disability Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| And we, as service providers, did not know this was going to happen to the people that we were serving until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| And we were outraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| And we said, why didn't someone come and meet with the service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| and we would be glad to sit down and create a study group as to what are some of the options that we could create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| I've heard some really good ideas here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| We have a lot of brain power in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| Let's get it together and let's make this work for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Although, Lillian, to be fair, we had public meetings and it was in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| And public hearings were attended by 30 people who made comments, please do not make these cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| But in terms of it being the knowledge being out there, it was talked about pretty widely in July, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| And we had 30 people go and say, please don't make these cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| And no one came and said, hey, what can we do not to make these cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| They didn't listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| It was pretty much a dead deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Council Member Woodhull said that the CAT Board has not voted to do this or has not voted to implement this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3066)|
| 0:51:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Is that what you said or did I mishear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| But what I heard from the people is that this is going to be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| So how is it, maybe Ms. McGinnis can answer this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| If the CAT Board didn't vote to do this yet and we're now talking about studying other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| I hear folk talking about this is looking to be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| Tell me where we are in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| Is there an implementation date already online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| Yes, it's February 1st, which is Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| And that decision is made by the administration of CAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| No, sir, by the city of Knoxville administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| And what is the CAT Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| See, that's why I'm, help me understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| You were given a little bit of the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Who determines the routes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| KTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| And the lift service was implemented after the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| I mean the lift service was implemented with the ADA in the early 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| CAT, KTA had probably already been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| And CAT prepared a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| All transit systems had to prepare a response saying how they were going to be compliant with the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| And CAT at that time replied that they would provide service that was in compliance with the three-quarter mile rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| Over the years, as different areas were annexed into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| pockets were sort of singled out for lift service, whereas other pockets never received service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| And CAT's staff intention was to just try to define a service area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| a concrete service area with our last effort with the service changes that we discussed last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| It was determined that the KTA, since it really didn't establish anything other than the three-quarter mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| administratively a change could be made to the lift service area that was separate from the KTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| I think I have that accurately stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| I don't know if that really cleared it up for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| But CAT has sort of been operating under the assumption that we're meeting the requirements of the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| And then there's this other set of thoughts that we are serving the entire city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| whereas over a series of years, areas have been annexed into the city that we're not serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| And the lift service is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| We analyzed all our services back this summer to determine what service efficiencies could be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| that would impact the least people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| And this pocket of people receiving service outside of the three-quarter mile was small in comparison to our overall ridership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3232)|
| 0:54:00| And it seemed that this would be an efficiency that we could economically make without impacting a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| And we have identified the people who will be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| Fourteen have work-related trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| CAC will pick up that slack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| There are another 12 who have medical-related trips in that service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| And then there are a couple of other people who have shopping and social-type trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| These are unfortunate cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Anytime we make a cut, people are negatively impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| So through CAT's process of determining the service delivery area and the most efficient ways, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| to get the biggest bang for your buck, we're here right now with this decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| And if I may, the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, has a transportation component that impacts public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3283)|
| 0:54:52| And the FTA writes this about the ADA component of public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| Under the ADA, paratransit functions as a safety net for people with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| who are unable to make use of the fixed route or mainstream transit bus system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| It is not intended to be a comprehensive system of transportation that meets all the travel needs of persons with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| And I think sometimes our charge as being a public transit operator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| we get focused on serving as many people as possible with limited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| And the Lyft, unfortunately, is a very expensive service, and a few trips add up very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| Taking somebody 20 trips a month on the Lyft is $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| 20 trips, 20 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| It costs us $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| It costs us $50 a day to transport a person to and from on the Lyft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| $26 is a one-way trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| People usually go round trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| It's $50 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| I hate that it's economics, but it is to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| And we have a very tight budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| And we have a very tight budget this year, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| And this was a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| I don't want to get back into the economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| I was just trying to understand the decision-making matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Let me suggest this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| You want to go, Councilor Becker, or I have a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| Let me just suggest that we, with CAT, that we delay implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3373)|
| 0:56:21| And I don't know what the right period of time is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| And we will meet with the service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| They actually met, I think, with some members of senior staff this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| And let's look at some alternatives that make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| I do want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| It's one of the hard things for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| We do this at budget times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| We go, well, how can you make a decision based on dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| But we have to do that on a whole lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| And I understand that sounds real cruel, but we do that on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| sidewalks for kids to walk to school and, you know, enough firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| Lots of stuff that are issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| And so it's hard to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| And we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| This is a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| I think what Cindy was trying to say, Mark, is we have a certain amount where we're prescribed to do it by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| We have other places that just over time CAT and some individuals decide, yeah, we'll service there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| But we're not servicing the whole city right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| We're not doing that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| And so I think what CAT was trying to do was saying we need to have a uniform procedure for what we service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| what we don't now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| Some people brought up a good case of, well, I moved to that house because I thought it would be service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| So there are some issues around that now, and we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| And there's also some issues around, well, what are the right needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| Is it for, will we do it for job reasons and for medical reasons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| Will we also do it for social reasons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| So there's a whole lot of issues around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| It's a policy that's beyond the three quarters that's grown up without a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| It's a procedure that's grown up without a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| I think CAT was trying to bring that back to say we'd have something we can live with that we can say this is our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| May I refine your suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Could we allow CAC to provide the work-related trips that we've already been transforming to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| and then perhaps grandfathering those current trips that already exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| So let me make sure I get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Medical trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Yeah, make sure I get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| So right now CAC has agreed to assume the work-related trips that are outside the three quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| That right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| And so we're saying assume, we'll go ahead and do that with CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| The others we will grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| During the discussion period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| During the discussion period until we see what sort of alternative solutions are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| And then what we do need to do, though, is come up with a consistent policy that we can live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| instead of just what's an ad hoc policy that's developed over the years that we really can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| And I've been, I think I made one meeting in the war room upstairs at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| so I haven't been to all these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| I'm just trying to get straight in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| And as we buy a little time to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| I'm trying to make sure I understand roles and responsibilities as it relates to the CAC board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| the management organization of CAC, city administration, and the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| We're all partners in this, but it's kind of blurred right now who has what decision-making authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| In my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| I have a flow chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| And I was about to say, if you have a flow chart that says, boom, boom, boom, let me see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| and that would be helpful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| You know, in my mind, I'm just kind of blurred on it because I want to know that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| I understand the administration says we've got this much money, proposes a budget to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| council approves a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Does that mean then CAC has a responsibility to determine routes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| I just want to understand how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| When I'm making a decision, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| And bottom line, I'll come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Bottom line, one of the difficulties is the CAC board has the authorization to determine routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| They do not have the, we have the budget, we have the responsibility to meet the budget gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| And so there's a mismatch in the way the whole thing is designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| And the CAC can say, well, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| The KTA board can say, we want to keep service in all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| But we don't, you know, we put about $8 million a year into CAC right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| And that's what I was assuming with the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| which then makes it very confusing to a lot of folk as to, you know, how the decision is being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Who's making what decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| And I want to be very clear and make sure everybody is very clear on how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| I may be the only one that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| No, it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| That was the issue which causes a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| It's like being able to say, you know, you know, I've got $10 I can give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| and you on the other end are saying, yeah, but I want to spend $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| So what do I do on my end if I can only give you $10, but you're saying you want $30 on the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| And the person who's in the middle trying to get those benefits is saying, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| who's messing up and dropping the ball here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| And I think that's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| That's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| I think Councilwoman Woodhuller, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| This question is for Ms. McGinnis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| In the back of our agenda packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| there is an attachment showing the route adjustments that were considered at the public hearing on July the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| And then there are effective dates of implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| and that includes the elimination of the Sunday service and the late line trolley and some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| Have all of these route adjustments been implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| And it looks like the suggested date, other than the advertising program, has all passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| Can you tell which ones have been implemented and which ones have not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| The revenue raising initiatives were implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3675)|
| 1:01:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| I don't have that sheet in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| But there are routes to apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Those apartment complexes did agree to be funding partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| Those routes are still in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| We did increase fares this past Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| We had a very successful fare increase deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| We did increase our football shuttle fares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| We did increase our Farragut football shuttle fare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| We were attempting to get an advertiser for the exterior of the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| We had some glitches with an RFP that was recently issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| We're going to be reissuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| So the revenue raising options have been put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| The options that relate more to service cuts were never approved by the KTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| So the Sunday service is still in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| I was under the impression that had been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| I guess my point is I think what this process needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| Now, Sunday service for the lift, the sheet you have in front of you refers to fixed route Sunday service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3736)|
| 1:02:26| fixed route bus Sunday service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| On November 1st, I don't think this is spelled out on that sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| This was determined after that sheet was produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| On November 1st, lift service was curtailed to the service area that we put out on Saturday and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3755)|
| 1:02:43| On Saturday, we have reduced service from weekdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| On Sunday, we have significantly reduced service from weekdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| Those two cuts to the lift did take effect November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| The February 1st cut to the lift impacted weekdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| And, of course, weekdays is where we spend all our money, both on the fixed route and on the lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| That's our expensive service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| We have the most service out during the weekdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| I guess I think the concern that all of us on council share is that, as some have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| we come up with a comprehensive policy that's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| And I think what we have been doing up until now has been ad hoc and areas have been added on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| and other areas haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| And to me, it's not a policy that's defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| I mean, there are folks that probably should have been served over the past 10 years that we haven't been serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| And I think also we need to realize that we've been in a real critical place with our funding for CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| and it's not just the lift services that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| As a council and as an administration and a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| we've got to look across the board at how to run this system efficiently and affordably for our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| So it's a multifaceted approach we've got to look at to try to bring this into balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| I guess just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| I sort of like, Mr. Mayor, your idea of let's get together and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| Let's lose some of the great grand pair we have to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| I was going to ask Councilman Woodall if he can participate in those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| I mean, I think it's good to have somebody from council in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| And I know you're represented on CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| I just wanted to get that on the record that I at least would like you to be involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Excuse me, Councilman Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| I just wanted to thank you for your process and what you're willing to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3873)|
| 1:04:41| But I did also want to say that while the policy may not be defensible, people don't live by the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| They live by what they're accustomed to receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| But people also live by, well, why do they get that and I don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| And we have to be able to defend that ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| So, I think everybody can see this is a hard situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Everything from how we fund CAT and how routes are decided with the difference between the CAT board and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| and this council's budget responsibilities to a policy that has grown ad hoc over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| which I think we all feel like needs to have some work done to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| So, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| I was going to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| But, Councilman Hookless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Of course, the Transportation Mobility Committee that Councilman Bailey and I co-chair may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| or may not have an appropriate role to play in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| But since Councilman Woodall serves on that committee, I think that's a good link or liaison there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| So, I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| Ms. Bielow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| No, I would just comment that I have to echo Councilman Brown's comments about being somewhat confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| And, you know, I think we have had a lot of information tonight that we certainly were not familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3950)|
| 1:06:00| So, I can see how confusion has troubled many of you simply because the process is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3960)|
| 1:06:10| And I also want you to know that, and perhaps we should all think about this, we are the ones to get the phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3970)|
| 1:06:19| We are the ones who get the e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| We are the ones who have not participated in any of these discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| so that we really felt comfortable in trying to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| So, I appreciate the mayor's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| And I think it will benefit everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| We will leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4004)|
| 1:06:44| We'll get back together with a group of people to coordinate those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| I do want to say that the problem, I think everybody understands, it hasn't gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| We just have to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| And it's worth it for us to all take some time to sit down, Tom, and get a group together and discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| So, thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| We are now going to return to our regularly scheduled reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| Ms. Bielow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| Mayor Haslam, I did have a report that someone asked me to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| But, frankly, because this is a constituent in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| and someone who has worked so tirelessly to bring about this good report that needs to be shared with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| I would like to ask if she could deliver that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| Terry Faulkner is going to comment a bit on a sort of a celebratory situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4052)|
| 1:07:42| that we're going to enjoy very much in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| And I think all of Knoxville will enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Actually, I think Councilman Brown's district also shares in this celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Because we're kind of Siamese twins down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| Almost bringing Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Almost, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| It's a little piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| If we just cross the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| You all be quiet so Terry can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Well, I'll make this as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| I'm Terry Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| And I am so happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| This is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| And I want to thank the mayor and also add to the accolades for David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| And as a city tree board member, I worked with David to do a grant application to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4105)|
| 1:08:32| And we received a state urban forestry grant which has funded, along with the city's match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4112)|
| 1:08:41| almost 100 trees that go from Bearden to the north end of 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| And with the trees that the mayor has provided for 17th Street in anticipation of the Civil War sesquicentennial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4129)|
| 1:08:59| we're going to have a corridor that's almost six miles long of a planned tree plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4139)|
| 1:09:07| So we're just real excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| And I wanted to thank you and Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Thanks to you and Charlie for carrying the heavy water on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| They did indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| And I guess I should say that Councilman Holquist needs to celebrate in that as well, as that's part of your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| It's a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Other reports of council members are ready to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, zoning regulations, Article V,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| Section 10 signs, billboards, and other advertising structures and related sections regarding the operating regulations of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| We have a host of people who have signed up to speak with check marks in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Parliamentarily, and I guess this is a question for Ms. Poplin and Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| do we need to do anything to get all the handouts we've gotten officially on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| Because I know we've gotten one I got today and one that came in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| And just sort of to be clear what we are talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| I think we have done what we have done so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| And that has been prepared by Ms. Poplin and others, I think, into the handouts that you have received prior to today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4217)|
| 1:10:27| including the one that you received today, I think the 27-page one, also includes some highlighted materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| which are proposed amendments to add tonight, if you all think that that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| But I don't think there's anything to do until you get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Ms. Poplin, if you disagree, feel free to jump in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| We've got legal consensus up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| I'm going to go ahead and call on folks as they've signed up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| I've got one, two, three, four, five people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| And I think they're kind of, like I said, some for some against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| They're kind of in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| So I'm going to go ahead and just take them in the order they're signed up in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| And I think it will work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| And if we need to come back and adjust the discussion, we will in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| First up is either Robert Bedwell or Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4270)|
| 1:11:18| Mr. Mayor, Members of Council, I will not repeat what I said last week in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4278)|
| 1:11:28| I am here on behalf of Turkey Creek Land Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| We have proposed an amendment which was recommended by the MPC to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4293)|
| 1:11:42| That was amended by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| We propose that development directory signs in developments that exceed 100 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4305)|
| 1:11:55| and are covered by a master signage plan be allowed on that development directory sign an EMC of up to 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4315)|
| 1:12:07| I thought I had gotten it to all council members, and it appears that I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| An amendment from last month, you all cut it down to 100, that would sort of stagger this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| and encourage new developments and existing developments in the city to be covered by a master signage plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4341)|
| 1:12:32| and would allow EMCs based on the size of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| There are five developments in the city of Knoxville covered by an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| They are Turkey Creek, which is far and away the largest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| There is also the farmer's market development on Millertown Pike next to East Town that is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| There is marketplace development on Kingston Pike that is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| There is Carson Point and on Chapman Highway at John Sevier Highway, which is a Wal-Mart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| and a Home Depot that is covered, and also a small development where the chop house is in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4390)|
| 1:13:18| We think master signage plans should be encouraged not only for new developments in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| but also existing developments, and that can be done by incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4405)|
| 1:13:33| As I have mentioned, we have gotten a lot of paper on what actually was accomplished last week on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4413)|
| 1:13:42| and I assume the latest ideation that came out this morning is the consensus on what was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| with the city law department's recommendations on what should be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4429)|
| 1:13:59| I will mention that since the last meeting, I have met with Mr. Duane Greaves on two occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| We have not agreed, but we have had very pleasant discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| and there may be some areas of agreement between my clients and Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4451)|
| 1:14:19| We have none to present to you all tonight on what this ordinance should finally look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| But I think if given two weeks to further discuss the issue, there may be common ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4465)|
| 1:14:33| between those who support some EMCs and Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| although I understand tonight they are still adamantly opposed to EMCs in any form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| But at least there have been discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| I have given Mr. Greaves the proposed amendment that I have passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| I gave it to him last night in a meeting about four o'clock yesterday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| I am sure he has not had time to digest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| Rather than having to come back time and time again with these signage issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| Turkey Creek Land Partners is supportive of good signage in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| Scenic Knoxville is supportive of good signage in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| We are certainly not in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| but we would like the opportunity to further discuss the issue before this ordinance is read on its second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| and final time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| And I will, Mr. Bedwell and I are here to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Mr. Seymour, I think before you sit down, Mr. Frost has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| I'm listening to what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| You said your clients, plural, do you have more than Turkey Creek Land Partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| Farragut Land Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| But, no, that's ñ I'm not speaking on behalf of anybody other than Turkey Creek Land Partners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Although I think Mr. Turley and his partners are certainly interested in an attractive city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| a city with good signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| And they have stepped up to the plate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| I don't mean to imply anything, but as you said, clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| And I was thinking people, north, south, east, west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| Based on what Mr. Seymour just said, would it be beneficial maybe to hear from Mr. Greave at this point to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| if he is in agreement that two weeks may be a beneficial, may provide benefit to our debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4590)|
| 1:16:37| and our deliberations, and if so, it may save us from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| Robert, Dwayne, are you all okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| That's actually next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| But if you ñ Dwayne, if you want to come on up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| There are others signed up to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| But, I mean, if ultimately going to ñ if ultimately we may end up putting this off two more weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| we're going to have another hour and a half debate, two hours tonight like we did two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| and then put it off two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| And everybody who's here to speak tonight will speak again in two more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| And we'll hear the same thing over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| And I want to make sure we go through the debate with an eye towards trying to render a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| I'm David, number eight, Emory Place here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Councilman, to answer your question, ideally what we would like to happen is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| that if council could vote on the amendment that's before them, or not the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| but the ordinance that's before them, that we're in full agreement with a ban on any new EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| We also are in agreement with the regulations that have been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| We did have two concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| One had to do with government signs complying with the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| And the other, as Mr. Seymour was saying, is that our concern about the development directory signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4667)|
| 1:17:55| is that we are interested in how those development signs are done throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| But as we stand right now, we have no agreement from the standpoint of having any EMCs on those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| Our preference would be no EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| However, the regulations that are before you do allow for 100 square feet on EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4690)|
| 1:18:19| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Well, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| I guess it says we talk tonight and then maybe vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| I guess that's what it says to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| I do have some remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| And I guess maybe Vice Mayor Brown wanted to see is there a deal that's worth waiting for for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| without us having an hour's worth of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| I think that's what Vice Mayor Brown, I think maybe your conclusion is after that is probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| It's on the two-week extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Yeah, I guess I think it's a good discussion to have up front to say how long are we having a discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| If we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| I actually would support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| I'd like to actually see us do some of the housekeeping changes to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| that we do take the time to get clarity on what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| I have one or two little things to clarify what I proposed two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| So not automatically postpone, but to say I would like to postpone eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| The handout that some folks received from Mr. Seymour via e-mail before the meeting and some tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| I've talked about it with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| And if we start to get into the proposed amendments, we would be going back on first reading on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| I mentioned that to Mr. Greve, I believe I mentioned it to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| So if you postpone for two weeks and then we decide whether or not to implement these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| we would be going back to the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| So I wanted to, you know, let folks know we might not be going on to second reading in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4788)|
| 1:19:56| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| I'm going to go back to the speakers as signed up, and Mr. Bedwell will be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| Robert Bedwell, 1321 Harvey Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| When the master signage plan language was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| it was written at the request of Turkey Creek Partners working with the Metropolitan Planning Commission staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4813)|
| 1:20:22| We did that because billboards, off-premise advertising had been banned by this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4822)|
| 1:20:30| It was written so that Turkey Creek could utilize it, but also broad enough that other developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4830)|
| 1:20:38| and hopefully redevelopments would utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| As Mr. Seymour has pointed out so far, five developments have utilized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| After your all's comments two weeks ago, we went back and looked at the language we'd proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4846)|
| 1:20:55| and could we broaden it, break the incentives down a little better to encourage smaller parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4855)|
| 1:21:06| not 25,000 square feet parcels, but our number we picked was five acres as a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4866)|
| 1:21:14| but to encourage smaller groups of users to get together to start to utilize some better signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4874)|
| 1:21:23| give up old signs, come up with ground-mounted signs, have them all approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| If there's any question, it comes to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| But, again, to focus with an incentive for all types and sizes so that maybe it's not tonight that they utilize the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4894)|
| 1:21:47| but hopefully over the next few years they do come to the realization that there's a benefit and they step to the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4907)|
| 1:21:55| It's occurred with the master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| I think you'll see more master signage plans come in as some of these big tracks are developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| And that's what we're trying to do with this is, again, it's an incentive for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| and it obviously would take care of what our need is tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| I'm going to go to, I guess, next signed up on this issue is Mr. Greave and then Marlene Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| Can I just ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| I guess it would be Mr. Seymour because I believe he's the one who would have the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| But it's my understanding that already there is a large tract on Kingston Pike, the Sherrill property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| which is proposing to get involved in developing a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| That's a hundred-plus acre tract that is mixed office, commercial, and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4961)|
| 1:22:49| And I think this is a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| It has not been submitted yet, but there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| And the encouragement there came from all the discussions that occurred prior to development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| and because of the agreement with the neighborhood adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| that this would be the most satisfactory kind of signage to explore for their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| So, basically, I think the agreement for them to develop it had a great deal to do with their interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| in how the signage was going to be presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| And then it's my understanding also that, although I can't tell you where it is because that's not out there yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| there's one other additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| There is a small center on North Shore Drive near Palisipi Parkway that we will be bringing to MPC in the not too distant future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5007)|
| 1:23:39| Well, and I would just comment that that has been so exciting to me that this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| people are seeing the value and seeing in considering master signage plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| So I just wanted to make that comment since that kind of added on to what the comment that Mr. Bedwell made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Excuse me, Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| Thank you, Mayor, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| Again, Duane Greve, number eight Emory Place here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| I'm here as president representing Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| And, again, rather than repeating the background information that we've already presented to you in regard to EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| and the history of Scenic Knoxville, I'd like to once again emphasize to Council what our mission is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| which is to preserve and enhance the scenic resources of Knoxville and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| At this time, we're concerned about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| We're most proud of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| We want people to come here to live, to work, and to visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| and are working toward a goal of helping Knoxville avoid what has happened in so many communities across the U.S.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5080)|
| 1:24:47| and that's visual pollution and visual clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| Our scenic environment is much too precious to be destroyed by unsafe, distracting, and unsightly signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| Before I state our position on the proposed revision to the ordinance on the EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| I want to let you know that in a very short time, Scenic Knoxville has been in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| We have a membership base of 135-plus individuals, several organizational groups such as KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| and the Knox Council of Garden Clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Checking our membership roster today, I realized that over 90 percent of our membership live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5118)|
| 1:25:26| So I'm here to speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| Now, as far as Scenic Knoxville's position on the proposed EMC ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| first, we support the ban on any new EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| And I want to clarify something, especially for Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| We are not against a master signage program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| In fact, we're in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| What we are against are electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| We support the proposed regulations with a couple of exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| Number one, we don't think that the city signs should be exempt from the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| And number two, as to the development directory signs, our preference is no EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| As a compromise, we would like to see further study of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| We've had an excellent dialogue with Turkey Creek representatives over the last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| as Mr. Seymour has said, and would like to continue those discussions as it would pertain to guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| for the city-wide signage program as it has to do with the master sign program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| As Arthur said, we've not agreed on this issue yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| I do want to mention that Turkey Creek is to be commended on their master signage program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| What they put into effect at their development would be an excellent guide for future developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| And I hope that each of you have had an opportunity to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| and look at the type of signage that they require for inside their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| We encourage and highly promote this type of wayfinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| Their design guidelines for signage within their development is what we would like to see expressed externally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| to their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| What they have on the inside, we'd like to see on the outside of their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| and not to have an EMC along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| So basically, our disagreement with Turkey Creek is the proposed EMC of 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| Now, that's 400 square feet on each side of a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| So it's really 800 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| I was sitting back here thinking that if you take the sliding partition there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| go up 14 feet and go over to the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| that's what we're going to have on each side of a pole at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| And we don't think that's appropriate, especially for what they've done on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| So we have a disagreement in terms of the EMC, which we consider to be a digital billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5267)|
| 1:27:54| 14 feet high, 30 feet long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| As I mentioned before, I do think that digital billboards and EMCs are only a part of an overriding issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5277)|
| 1:28:04| that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| Wayfinding is important, and we need to look at all areas of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| develop signage design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| and begin to look at what has happened with the proliferation and clutter of signage throughout our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| We have areas of our city where it is difficult to find businesses due to the massive amount of signs along the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| Scenic Knoxville is not anti-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| Scenic Knoxville is not anti-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| We want people to find the businesses in an orderly, non-confusing, safe way that is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| with our scenic environment, a fact that has been done in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| Banning EMCs and regulating existing EMCs is a beginning and the right step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| Let's continue to work together in the spirit of cooperation and remove any potential visual clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| remove the proliferation of any illegal signage in the city, ban any additional digital signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| and continue to work towards a green community by enhancing our natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| I'll be happy to continue to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| And, again, Mayor, Council, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| Mr. Green, since you made the offer when you and I talked earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| I was still a little unclear based on your response to Councilman or Vice Mayor Brown and his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| I thought I understood you to say earlier today when we talked that you might be okay with a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| in order to address some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| So just could you help me in clarifying that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| If you're right, you and I discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| And what I was thinking is that is there a way to go ahead and pass the ordinance that's on the table with the ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5389)|
| 1:29:58| of EMCs and the regulations that have been put forward to you except for the development directory sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5398)|
| 1:30:06| That was really what I was thinking in terms of so that we can have further discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| With the commitment to pursue that in a subsequent action by way of ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| If that's possible and workable on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| In other words, can you approve an ordinance and leave a part out and come back and review that later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5422)|
| 1:30:30| You can approve an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| If you approve an ordinance that doesn't have substantive material changes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| then you will have approved this ordinance on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| It will go into effect 17 days after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| That can be subsequently amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| but there is a procedure that has to be followed then to subsequently amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| which includes starting at MPC and coming back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| So I'm not sure that's what you really have in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5452)|
| 1:31:00| Again, you know, I'm not sure the procedure in terms of how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| I think that what we're saying is we're willing to have further discussion on the development directory signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5465)|
| 1:31:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| Anybody else for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| Marilyn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| I just wanted to clarify with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| It seems to me that the issue of the master signage plan language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| the development directory sign language, is going to have to go back to MPC anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| I mean, either if we amend what we have in front of us tonight to add that, that becomes a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| It is a substantive change, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| But it is a change that has already been considered by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| If we added that tonight, it would send us back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| It would send us back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| So that would be one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| The other option would be to take the master sign plan language off the table for tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| and go ahead and consider what we considered two weeks ago on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| And if that passes, that would be in place and then take some time for folks to talk about the master sign plan thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| That would have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| I just want to clarify that I know where we are procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| Yes, I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| But, you know, I would suggest that probably based on the proposed amendments coming from the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| there are some things that the city law department feels pretty strongly about that you don't really want to pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| ordinance without making some amendments to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| But those aren't those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| And those are substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| Oh, the ones that the law department have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| The ones that the law department proposes are substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| The ones that Mr. Becker proposes are essentially clarifications and would not send you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| That's what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| Oh, well, the ones I've talked to Mr. Becker about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| I didn't understand that the law department amendments pushed us back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| So thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| Mr. Swanson, help me understand here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| If we pull out what Councilman Roddy talked about, the master signage plan issue, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| based on e-mails that I've been reading, like I'd like to consider amortization for EMCs that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5587)|
| 1:33:18| Can that fit in if we pull out the master signage plan or help me here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5598)|
| 1:33:25| In my view, you really cannot adopt an ordinance that includes amortization at this point because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| we haven't done sufficient legal research to determine the viability of amortization here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| You can adopt an amendment that simply doesn't change what you're codifying here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| but sends the issue with regard to amortization to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| and to the law department to do a study on that issue to come back and report to you as to the viability of amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| I seem to recall, and I guess it didn't become part of the official record that was sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| there was discussion many months ago about the potential amortization issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| I guess it just didn't get there and we might need to start working towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| When it was amended last week, it simply, you amended to a version of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5655)|
| 1:34:22| that simply said consideration would be given to amortization in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| but that wasn't sufficient to include any type of genuine amortization within the codification of the ordinance that you were adopting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5667)|
| 1:34:36| So I hope that clarifies it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| I guess, actually, this is a good follow-up, Mr. Forrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| because I think what we've got is actually a lot of stuff that still needs to be talked about, one being the amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| And I think the other one is sort of what Mr. Greaves is talking about, but it's much bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| It's not just master sign plans or directory development signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| Keep in mind that the ordinance we've got says that we're banning new EMCs except for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| and there's some language that includes special districts, some options for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| and I think there's a lot of that discussion that we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| I think one of the things that we need, and it will work if what we do puts this back on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| is something setting up a study committee to look at some of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| to pull folks from the administration together, from council, from scenic Knoxville, from neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| but also from the business community to talk about how we do those and do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| And I know it's going to take some more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| but I think we need to continue to put the time in to do this issue right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| and, you know, not leave our grandchildren with the issues we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5740)|
| 1:35:46| And we can make a better city that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| So I think I'm going to have something to do that at the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| I still have others who are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| I'm going to go back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Marlene Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| After Marlene is Terry and then I think Jamie is on this issue too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Marlene Davis, 1935 Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| And I work at University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| I'm an architect, not practicing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| I've devoted my career to working with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| I'm passionate about the built environment, physical environment, our visual environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| We intuitively know evidence has demonstrated that all of us are affected by the physical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| visual environment, whether that's the comfort of our own home, the productivity of a workplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| tranquility of a church, wonderful interiors of Tennessee Theater, our great downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| our beautiful landscape here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| And this applies to our shopping districts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| Signs are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| There's a time and a place for all signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| And we rely on our elected officials for ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| And it would be great to have voluntary master signage plans in place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5819)|
| 1:37:06| But it's important to have this kind of series of guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| Signs, billboards create visual pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| These new technologies with LED lights are increasingly bright, increasingly distracting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| and potentially dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| I want to make an argument that the EMCs do not really help small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5843)|
| 1:37:31| and that the ban on EMCs will, in fact, improve business because it creates a level playing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| for all small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| It retains the character of different shopping districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| If you permit them, you're going to endorse a signage war where every business is going to feel compelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5865)|
| 1:37:52| to get something to keep up with the new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| And as a result, you're going to have a proliferation of brighter moving signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| even if you slow down the movement, so that there's so much visual chaos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| the signs are going to be ineffective anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| I really thank you all for the work you did the last two weeks, the hours in drafting your first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| I think it's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| I think the ban on EMCs would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| I think the strict regulation of existing EMCs is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| I think right now you're grappling with what are the exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| Can't you go ahead, ban it new, impose strict regulations for existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5910)|
| 1:38:37| and then have your study group to really carefully consider how do we make exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| and what would be the kind of policies for exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| I would say an exception, it may or may not make sense for 100-acre development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| but certainly if they wanted an EMC, 100 square feet is 10 feet by 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5933)|
| 1:39:01| Big difference with 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| Duane referred to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| I looked at it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Imagine 10 feet high and 40 feet long is a lot longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| That is really only aimed at interstate traffic and not driving traffic in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5952)|
| 1:39:20| So I think the 100 square feet for an EMC in a large development is much more reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| than thinking about 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| At any rate, bottom line, we don't need more signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| Think about banning the EMCs, regulations for new ones or for the existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| and then maybe a more careful consideration for the exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Terri Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| Terri Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| And I'm here as the chairperson of the Burden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| And we're requesting that you support the amendments before you on second reading tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| and not postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| And many of our members have since 1987, and our membership includes developers, business folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6007)|
| 1:40:17| We think of TDOT as a member because they've helped us so much with beautification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| and public transit improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| We've worked together and have even had businesses volunteer to do small signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6025)|
| 1:40:32| And I think that if you've been familiar with the business community since on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| and Bearden since 1987, you know that at that time we had some real problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| We had lots of vacant buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| It was a semi-slum area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| Not real bad, but it was pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Anyway, community leaders, businesses worked to beautify, to improve pedestrian access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6052)|
| 1:41:03| to improve public transit with safe public transit stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| And we created one of these areas where we have folks that want to live because of the quality of the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6067)|
| 1:41:16| the access to public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| I was really sympathetic with these folks tonight because we have so many that live in Bearden that use the lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| And there are not a lot of areas that have a great quality of urban life where you can access all these amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6085)|
| 1:41:35| And I think in the last two years we've added maybe four digital signs in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6095)|
| 1:41:43| And it's a real step backwards for what we've been trying to accomplish there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| And if you've seen those, you know what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| So I really hope that you'll support these amendments tonight and not postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| I think that's all I have signed up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| If somebody's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| That's all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| Just to start with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| As I understand it, what we have on the table right now is what was in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| And the law department has proposed the amendments that are in this handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| And I think to get things moving, I'm going to make a motion to approve all the amendments in yellow in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| I tend to trust the law department in getting the small things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| So I'd like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| For a matter of clarification, are you referring to the e-mail that I've got from Debbie Poplin this morning at 1009 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6151)|
| 1:42:40| Ms. Poplin, should I say yes or no to that, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| It's the one that looks like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| I got it in my hand, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| Yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| Yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| And there was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| Further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| I have a motion, a second, and no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| I was confused about what happened to the exception for price signs, which I guess are primarily at gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6186)|
| 1:43:17| but there might be some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| And I guess I just missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| According to the transcript that Law Director Poplin looked through, there was a vote where that was deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6201)|
| 1:43:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| That was in the summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| I believe it was amendment two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| The effect of that was to take the changeable price signs out as an exception to the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6215)|
| 1:43:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| Well, then I'll just leave that alone right now for clarity and just go with the yellow stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| So the effect of this is we're going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| If this passes, we go back to first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| That's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| The effect is if it passes, this is first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| Tonight will be first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| This is a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| Mr. Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| On number four, part one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| I've got the electronic version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| It says screen three of 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| I don't know how that worked out on the printer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| I didn't get a printed version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| All I've got was sent to me by e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| There should be page numbers at the bottom of each page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Is this no sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Not on the one you e-mailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| No signs of scrolling, intermittent, flashing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| Yeah, it's the yellow version of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| It's at page two of 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| And then it's the four that has the yellow highlight, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Part one of that, number four, part one of that in the yellow highlighted section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| It's the one that refers to H-1 overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| It was pointed out to me, and I think it's something that needs to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| I don't know that it's a substantive amendment or not, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| but that should read that it has to comply with the design guidelines established for that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6316)|
| 1:45:26| so that you create design guidelines for an H-1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| And if the sign regulations for allowing for EMCs are not included in the design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6330)|
| 1:45:37| and the design guidelines either cannot be allowed by decision of the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6337)|
| 1:45:45| without the amendment of those regulations, of those district regulations or guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| Actually, the design guidelines are mentioned in four, subpart two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| But that just refers to D-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| I'm talking about the H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| The sign located in historic 4-1 references historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| 4-2 references downtown design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| And what I'm saying, 4-2 specifically, as Ms. Poplin said, does reference the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| but 4-1 does not, which would be the guidelines for an H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| Well, 4-1 requires it to have a certificate of appropriateness, and to get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| it would have to meet the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| So that is your interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Well, as long as we're clear about that, I just want to make sure whether it's explicit or implicit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| I want to make sure that it does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| Counselor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Briefly, I want to make an amendment to do something similar a little later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| and making sure that we're clear that you have to meet the guidelines on all these exceptions we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| So the sense you would have, Ms. Poplin, is if we say it's received a certificate from the downtown guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| or the Historic Zoning Commission, it's met the guidelines that go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| That's assumed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| We don't need to spell that out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| And this is actually the language as it was existing prior to the amendments at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| I would just say, since I brought that up, I know my light's not on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| but I prefer language that is explicit, that's clear, so that when people read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| there's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| When they see certificate of appropriateness, they have to somehow make that connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| I prefer to have the language in there so that it's clear and they don't have to sort of process it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| I think, Mr. Swanson, that would be a subsequent amendment to adopting this amendment, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| If we wanted to add language, we would do that after we adopt the vote that's on the floor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| Yes, you can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| Does that help, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| Maybe easier to do it that way so we can keep it straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6472)|
| 1:47:59| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| You know, I do not have the certificate of appropriateness, I guess, guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6481)|
| 1:48:09| or those requirements there, so I want to ask a basic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| In passing this and then saying you have to receive a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| under the National Historic Zoning Commission, whatever criteria they're utilizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| does that criteria as it currently exists prohibit these type of signs that we're saying could be put in those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6504)|
| 1:48:31| Does anyone know the answer to that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| Yes, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| They do not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| I think it would depend on the district regulations for that specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| What I'm saying is we're saying here, okay, no sign shall do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| No sign shall have this, except, yada, yada, yada, except in these districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| You can have some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| Now, we're saying there's an exception here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| Once you go down to those districts and look at their requirements for appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| do they in and of themselves prohibit these type of signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| The proposal you have before you, yes, sir, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| Most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| So, by so doing, we're saying we're creating an exception that's going to send someone to a process that's going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6548)|
| 1:49:15| that exception does not fit our guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| And so, you're really sending someone down to get a no answer unless those guidelines are amended, or am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| I believe when you approve that exception in the H-1, you are allowing the EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| So, it is not, it will not be excluded from the base district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| Well, we're saying there's an exception here, but does their guidelines allow for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| I'm not saying here that Trump, whatever their requirements are, and, therefore, you know, what I'm trying to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| I'm wondering if we're putting folk in a catch-22 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| And I don't know those guidelines are going to have to say we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| We're creating an exception here, but there's a whole different set of guidelines that the National Historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| Zoning Commission is looking at, and that even the downtown design guidelines have a separate set to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| these are things very particular to this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| And these are things that are acceptable that are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| And if in those definitions, it excludes this exception we're making, we're creating a catch-22 for someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6614)|
| 1:50:23| And someone needs to think to the next step about addressing those guidelines, the downtown guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| as well as the Historic Zoning Commission issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| Or we're going to send some folk down there who are going to hit that brick wall and be told no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| And they're going to say, well, wait a minute, council made an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| And I could be really reading this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Well, I was asking Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| Well, if you've got an answer, please give me one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| Well, I think it just creates a parallel process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| In other words, instead of banning a mal-right, you put it into a whole different process or structure where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6651)|
| 1:51:01| Historic Zoning Commission has approved the guidelines for a specific H-1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| Those guidelines either allow the EMCs or they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| If someone thinks that they should and they don't, as you said, they can then be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| But it gives the flexibility within that district to allow them, if that's deemed appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6676)|
| 1:51:25| Well, my problem is, and I hear what you're saying in the dual processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| But I want to make sure that we're being intellectually honest here and not dishonest in the process unintentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| And that is, if I say to you, I'm making an exception and you can ride your bicycle in the Hastie Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6696)|
| 1:51:45| subject to the Hastie Park Commission's guidelines, and their guidelines say, no, you can't ride your bike in my park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6705)|
| 1:51:53| I've created a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| And that's why I'm wondering, are we doing that inadvertently here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| And if we are, someone needs to be resolutioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| Well, I think it's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| I think what we're saying is you're allowed to ride your bike in a city park if it's not excluded in the city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6723)|
| 1:52:11| And Hastie Park doesn't allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| Because I think it is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| What I think we're trying to say with this is you can do it in a D-1 zone or an H-1 zone or a special zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6734)|
| 1:52:22| or a master sign district if it's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| And my question is, is it allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Some of them will be allowed and some of them won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Well, Ms. Poplin has been wanting to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| Go ahead, Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6752)|
| 1:52:32| But if it's not allowed, we're putting something here that's just not something that's not intellectual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| It can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Hold on, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| Ms. Poplin, do you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Mark may be able to add specifics about the guidelines, but I can tell you that this process has been utilized for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6760)|
| 1:52:48| Tennessee Theater sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| That's when this was specifically amended for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| It went through and it received a certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| So, it's gone through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| So, we have an example where they, go ahead, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| There could, in fact, be some H-1 districts that would preclude an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| But generally, you know, the use of the term guidelines, there's a lot of shoulds and want to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| And there are very few shalls and shall nots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| But it's possible that an H-1 could have a shall not use an EMC in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| I'm not familiar with every set of guidelines in every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| And all I'm saying is, I'm not saying we shouldn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| All I'm saying is, if that is the case, we need to make sure that we're seeing that up front so folks understand that that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| possibility and that you may go right down and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| And we're giving you this possibility that does not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| And I just don't feel real comfortable with that without making sure all that's on the table, that people understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| And if not, it seems like we're playing a shell game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| And I don't want to be interpreted as doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| Mr. Frost, I think, had a comment on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Let me dust off my historic zoning commission hat here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| Let me take Old North Knoxville, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| That historic overlay is comprised of both residentially zoned properties, office zoned properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| and probably some commercial zoned properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| Your base zone is going to determine that, for example, for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| David and Beth Booker at their house on East Scott can't have a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6861)|
| 1:54:21| Because that's the residential guidelines, whether it's in a historic overlay area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| or one that doesn't have H1 or NC1 over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| You first look at the base zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| When you go through the overlay process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| there's the process that the neighborhood or the area or the property or properties in general go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6880)|
| 1:54:47| determine what, besides the restrictions that the base zoning applies to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6887)|
| 1:54:54| what other voluntary restrictions would they like to apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| I think I'm seeing where folks are talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| but I think the language that is there is not unintentionally dishonest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| It's, I admit, it's probably a little dense and you've got to work, you know, you've got to work through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| But I don't think it's, you know, I don't think it's a double standard or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| because your first thing you go to is your base zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| The second thing you go to is the overlay zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| And your base zoning might preempt what your overlay zoning may or may not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6931)|
| 1:55:39| And hopefully that helped explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| It helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| And as I said, I started out my statement with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| I don't understand or know those rules as well as you do or maybe others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| But I just did not want to see us saying, hey, there's an exception here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| I understand in residential areas, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| and I was glad to hear Ms. Poplin remind me that downtown with the Tennessee Theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| I imagine it happened with Regal also, that it worked out downtown that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| And it's just my concern that we're sitting here talking about an exception that may go into a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| that says, nope, sorry, it says shall not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| So while they gave that exception, you just can't do it here in the store, you move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| And all we've done is, you know, made a paragraph that has no real effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| because you don't have anywhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| So, you know, and, you know, just wanted to put that out there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| because it just jumped at me when Councilman Hulk was made that point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| Then it kind of jumped out at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| And I appreciate you making your point because it then illuminated this issue for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| that has further clogged, I mean, further clouded the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| There's no light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7002)|
| 1:56:50| So we have a motion and a second on the floor, which is, just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| this would be first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| Okay, what we're talking about are the yellow amendments, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| And I'm looking again at what we're looking at adopting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| And on page 19, in that yellow section, and page 12, the development directory signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7024)|
| 1:57:12| as part of a master signage plan are both referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| Do we, as a council, want that in, do we want that included in what we're doing tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| or do we want to pull out any reference to a master signage plan and deal with that later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| Because right now what's on the table are the yellow amendments, for lack of a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7050)|
| 1:57:37| And the yellow amendments do include some language referencing the development directory signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7057)|
| 1:57:45| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7065)|
| 1:57:46| Yes, my recollection, I learned a lot about parliamentary procedure two weeks ago when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| doing all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7071)|
| 1:57:51| And my sense is, and I have to give Mr. Swanson credit for trying to keep the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| understandable and it at least partly worked, what my sense would be parliamentarily is we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| adopt this and then we go back, because I guess we could actually amend this to delete that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| language, be clear to adopt it, and then have a separate amendment on the, I think, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| Swanson, that's an easier way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| And I think those kind of questions do need to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| But it seems easier to adopt this and then start making some changes to that, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7096)|
| 1:58:22| actually want to do to answer some of Mr. Brown's questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| I find myself in the troubling position of agreeing with Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| I am so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| Don't make a habit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| We have a moratorium in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| If we start pulling things out and we ultimately pass something, will that not end the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7117)|
| 1:58:46| This is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| Well, I realize it's first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| Not until you've completed it, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| Okay, I heard all ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| Okay, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| I'd like to make a clarifying amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| I know, I'm sorry, Ms. Peebles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| And this, it actually goes a lot to Mr. Brown's confusion and what Mr. Holquist was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| And this goes to, I've got it on page 12 of 27, where there are pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| And it's, God only knows if you don't have pages where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| And I know there are people who don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| Section E, it's the commercial district regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| And this would apply here, and I guess, again, on 19 of 27, where we do the industrial regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7174)|
| 1:59:41| And I want to explain what I want to do and then give the lawyers present who can get the language right a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7181)|
| 1:59:49| I've got some ways to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| We have, again, created something where we're saying EMCs are banned except for D1, H1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| Master Sign Plan, and special sign districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| My first thought was to put in some language that clarified that you need the approval of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| the Historic Zoning Commission for the H1, the Downtown Design Line, the Downtown Design Committee for the D1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| and some similar language on that, some to clarify what Mr. Brown is saying, that not all H1s allow them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7212)|
| 2:00:21| not all D1s, and not all sign plans allow them, but it is within those specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| My sense could be we could do it as simple as saying, adding to each of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| just if approved by the appropriate authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| But I do want to pause to let the attorneys have any, you know, any better thoughts on how to express that clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7234)|
| 2:00:42| I actually have some prepared language for that if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| That would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| Just going to page 12, I mean, it's the same language both on page 12 and on 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| But just going through the one that's on page 12, up at the top where it says E1, then come down to subsection A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| simply change that A to read that an EMC may be permitted in those areas covered by an H1 overlay district subject to approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7259)|
| 2:01:09| as required within an H1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| I think we'll accomplish what you want to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| Then in B, where it says an EMC may be permitted in those areas covered by a D1 overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7275)|
| 2:01:22| simply add language subject to approval as required within a D1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| Then coming down to D, it says an EMC may be permitted in those specific zone districts that allow EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7288)|
| 2:01:37| with approved design regulations or guidelines, simply add the words subject to approval by the appropriate regulatory body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7297)|
| 2:01:45| for such district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| I think that language will accomplish what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| Do we need anything on C or 3, the development, the master sign plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7311)|
| 2:01:57| No, because that talks about being within an approved master signage plan already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| Which implies it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| I think that doesn't need additional language in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| But that's ñ I won't make the motion that Mr. Swanson just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| That sounds perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| Both on page 12 and 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| Does everybody understand the motion that was just made in the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| I understand that, and I think that makes great sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| I just wanted to make sure, as I was thinking about my point earlier, I guess I was trying to ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| and Ms. Popham helped me out and also Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| While there are ñ I wanted to make sure that these regulatory bodies, these whatever zoning groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7352)|
| 2:02:40| or whatever in those they approved required, whatever the group is that approved these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| that they have, at least in some instances like downtown, that they have some discretion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| I wanted to make sure there was not any immediate prohibition language in all these districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| And what I heard from Mr. Donaldson, in some places there may be, but in others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| I think there is an opportunity or at least some discretion with regards to these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| And that's what I was trying to make sure that we weren't sending folk into a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7384)|
| 2:03:08| where it was an automatic prohibition by some shall not language or those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| And I think we've got the example downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| And then from what Mr. Donaldson said, and in some instances it's appropriate that it should be just banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| And as Mr. Frost's example, you know, you're right up in a residential neighborhood, so it should be banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7401)|
| 2:03:27| But downtown, you know, I think we may need to have that the regulatory body needs to have the discretion to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7407)|
| 2:03:35| to deal with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| So from what I hear and tell me, Mr. Poplin and Mr. Donaldson are right that there are examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| where this has been done before and there are areas where the regulatory bodies do have the discretion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| these subject to their, I guess, requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| When guidelines are adopted and they do not explicitly say something is prohibited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| they act as guidance to the approval body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| So there is discretion by the approval authority for any of those approvals with the guidelines being there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7441)|
| 2:04:10| to provide guidance rather than to provide strict regulatory language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| So there is that discretion available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| I guess a question of mine is there in E3 and also then on page 19, it would be the same in A3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7462)|
| 2:04:35| There is an indication of a minimum and a maximum square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| Now, my question is, this is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| Is that square footage something that can be amended on a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7484)|
| 2:04:52| if desired, after this discussion takes place between the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7492)|
| 2:04:59| and not have to go back to our friends at the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| I think the answer to that is, yes, it would not have to go back to MPC because they've already considered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| But if you change the square footage on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| that's probably a substantive material amendment that's going to put you back on first reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| Well, that was my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| I seconded the motion because I wanted us to be able to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7520)|
| 2:05:27| My concern is to constrain us to the point where any discussion that takes place between these parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7527)|
| 2:05:36| will not be something that we can consider on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| Well, I mean, if you want it to be second reading, if you wanted to pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| because everybody was comfortable with where you were, you could pass it on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| and then move to amend it to make an emergency, if you wanted to do that, over Mr. Becker's objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| Anything else, Ms. Below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Everybody remember what's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| Everybody okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| I've got one more, and this is a pet peeve amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| And it might, if Ms. Rodney, if you want to do your piece talking about the development directory signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| we might want to do that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| Mine is right now what we've said is that their development directory signs can't be more than 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| We also have this language that says their minimum is 20 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| And I want to delete that minimum because at some level, if somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| if we do approve development directory signs and they're allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| I don't want somebody having to build one bigger than they want because we put this in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| So I think I'm going to make that as a motion, and we might strike the whole section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| but I want to at least get that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| Well, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| I mean, can that be discussed when we look at the entire size issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| Yes, I said it was a pet peeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7617)|
| 2:06:58| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| I know it's a pet peeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| I've got a little pet peeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| Then mine wasn't a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| Not unless it's your pet peeve, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| It can be picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| I mean, it just seems, since there's a question about how this discussion is going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| that we might just look at that entire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| That's probably wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| Section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7640)|
| 2:07:21| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| Did he make a motion or did he not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| He did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| Chair ruled it was just a peeve, not a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| I'd like to clarify that two weeks ago when we considered this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| it did include a statement that consideration was supposed to be given to amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7655)|
| 2:07:40| And I believe if I'm stating this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| I'd like to move to amend what we have before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| that it doesn't change all of this that's going to be codified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| but that there's clearly a phrase that provides that we would like MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7670)|
| 2:07:56| and the law department to look at the possibility of amortization of existing signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| and whether or not that is possible in our current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7681)|
| 2:08:06| Are you comfortable with the language that I supplied with regard to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| Yeah, I just don't like to read other people's stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7692)|
| 2:08:13| But if you read it out loud, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7693)|
| 2:08:14| But if we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| If I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7695)|
| 2:08:16| When we're going back later and trying to put this into what ends up being in the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| We don't have a quarter pointer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| You've got it in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| Do you want to read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| Move to amend what we have before us so that the portion to be codified will not change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7711)|
| 2:08:40| but so it clearly provides that the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| and the law department and any other necessary department give consideration to the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7723)|
| 2:08:49| for an amortization plan for EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| and report back to city council with respect to their findings as to the potential for such amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7732)|
| 2:08:59| Are you comfortable with that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| Is this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| Mr. Swanson, does that actually trigger, does that require them to trigger the legislative process where they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| are they just reporting back or are they presenting with something that we can then act on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| Really, that will just require a reporting back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| But we need information from a number of different sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| So I really think that would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| And then when we get the information back, if it's appropriate to move forward with some type of legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7766)|
| 2:09:31| then do that once we get the report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| But I'm wondering if the language should be more inclusive so that if they find something substantive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| that they feel like they can put together as proposed legislation, they could go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| I guess NBC can do that anyway, though, can't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| They can initiate something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| They have the authority to initiate a change in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| And we'll leave it at that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| I'm sorry, what did we, what was the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| Charles wrote it based on my question to him via e-mail that I saw that the amortization language was not included in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7803)|
| 2:10:11| because we can't codify that yet because we haven't done the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| So I can read it again or Charles can read it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| No, I heard Charles, but I didn't understand the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| Is everybody comfortable with what's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7835)|
| 2:10:36| Well, there's one question Mr. Roddy brought up earlier, which was the omission of the price point signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| And I want to know the status of that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| Know the status of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| The apparently there seems to be an omission of the price changing signs in what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7850)|
| 2:11:01| I was under the impression that that went back in with the proposed amendments, but I'm not sure that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| Well, I felt that that was to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| It did not go back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| It's still out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| That's still out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| No, I just bring it up because I think we certainly need to discuss that before we make a decision on voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7875)|
| 2:11:25| I very frankly think it's very important information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| And I would regret to see that not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| I think in the last few months people have been very concerned or interested in knowing what that signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7894)|
| 2:11:45| the information that signage can give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| And I really think it's important public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| Counselor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7912)|
| 2:11:53| Yeah, I guess, you know, sort of mis-peeled over the question of what happened to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| I actually, when I made one of those motions two weeks ago, I did take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| As an exception, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| And I think what I would say now is that we, again, what we're sort of passing here is something that says EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7924)|
| 2:12:12| And these, as I understand it, doesn't include the signs that have just the neon that gives a price that's changeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7932)|
| 2:12:19| It's only the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| I want to see some of this discussion that we're talking about having around master sign plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7941)|
| 2:12:28| and development signs and special signs districts to include that, to think out how it does fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| I can see it fitting it as an exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| I have a lot of worries about how broad what came to us was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| But I can see some discussions happening on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| And I will include that in this resolution I'm thinking about for next meeting to include that for study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| I'm not comfortable with it being left out to the point where we don't have the ability to vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7970)|
| 2:12:57| or against that being included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| And, you know, I mean, frankly, I don't think I would be quite so sensitive to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| except that these past few months that's been a very crucial, important factor for people to consider when they're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7984)|
| 2:13:13| purchases of gasoline and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| And I think people who travel through our city need to be able to avail themselves of that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=7995)|
| 2:13:22| without having to stop and inquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| So, I mean, while I don't think they're the prettiest things in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| I do think that it's important information that people should be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| And I don't know any other way to make that available and see us ban that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8015)|
| 2:13:43| For point of clarification, they could still use the changeable reader board signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| People wouldn't have to stop and inquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| Maybe I'm missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| You could use the old-fashioned signs where people physically check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| Oh, Lord, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8036)|
| 2:13:57| And you can have a neon sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| Well, you can't afford me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| I'm too expensive to send out the rain and the snow and the wind and change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| and then have the wind blow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| So, folks, I've lived long enough to want to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8046)|
| 2:14:13| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| Ms. Pillow, did you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| No, I turned my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Right now there's nothing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Well, the ordinance itself, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| No, I think Mr. Becker assured me that that would be a part of the amendment that he can add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8065)|
| 2:14:33| The resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| Yes, the study resolution, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| Now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| You come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8079)|
| 2:14:40| With a study resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| We've got a lot of study to do on some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| That would be my plan for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| Well, I don't know how to craft a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| I don't have Mr. Swanson at my elbow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| So, well, I really feel it does need to be brought back into that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8094)|
| 2:15:01| Is that going to be a substantive change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| That has already been up for consideration, so I assume it can be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| It will be a substantive change, but it doesn't have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| We're on first reading already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| We're on first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| And it can remain a part of first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| But if you make the change, like, two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| When we go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| You want what's amendment number four, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| Mr. Swanson, you want to help me with the wording, and I'll just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| You just want amendment number four to provide for changeable price signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| and we have language that did that before, and we just put it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| Ms. Poplin knows where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| My move that we do is Mr. Swanson has commented that we, as amendment number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| that we put back in the changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8150)|
| 2:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| Second from Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8153)|
| 2:15:54| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| I guess, Ms. Pilo, let me be clear about what I think we're talking about is right now there are signs that are neon signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8156)|
| 2:16:04| that give the price of gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| And these are changeable price signs where you can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| You can change the per-gallon gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| That's not what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| We're talking about EMCs that do a similar thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| And I have some worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| We're talking about both, are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| I don't think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| I mean, I think that a sign that has a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| How can we not be talking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| Well, because those are because what the language we had before that said an EMC is permitted if it is a changeable price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8186)|
| 2:16:36| And this is some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| And I was just told that has been omitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8200)|
| 2:16:41| And you just confessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8201)|
| 2:16:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| That's why I took that out, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| The fellow who took it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| And part of what my fear is that what we had there is saying you can have an EMC if it is a changeable price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| And I didn't feel comfortable partly with the definition because we're not talking again about a set of neon numbers that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| can change a price with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| We're talking about an EMC that is called a changeable price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| And my understanding, my fear was that we were assuming these things could actually have diesel, unleaded, premium, super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8224)|
| 2:17:13| That may be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| And there were no guidelines on that on how often they could change, whether they could flash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| So I pulled them out because there was a lot of lack of clarity of what they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8242)|
| 2:17:27| And I think, and Ms. Cash, fill me in if I'm wrong about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8247)|
| 2:17:31| there's a sign that says right now unleaded and over here is neon that forms letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8251)|
| 2:17:38| It's the, you know, classic sort of like you have on a calculator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| They're red letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| And the price can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| Yeah, red letters or maybe green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| The price can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| That's allowed and nothing we're doing here is changing that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| So I think most of what we've got is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| And I think what you're talking about is an electronic message center that would be allowed to say here's a product and here's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8273)|
| 2:18:01| price of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| And I didn't see anything in it that said how many products, how many prices, how often they could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| And that worried me because it felt like I heard some interpretation that said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| So I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| You and I hear something else from Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| That's why I want to study this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| Anita, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| Now I hear I am worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| Anita, maybe you can clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| The current regulations allow those price changer signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| Currently, they were included in Option D that was adopted two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8311)|
| 2:18:37| Council Member Becker amended them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| That is why they are not before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| However, if you choose to put them back in, there are some problems with the language for those that was in Option D two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8322)|
| 2:18:52| One of them is you cannot call them gas price changers, which in one of these numbers it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8332)|
| 2:18:59| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| I recall that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| You can't regulate them just for gas prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| They have to be for hotel price, room prices, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| There is no minimum matrix size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| And, again, I want to remind you that what started this discussion years ago with EMCs were the small, small EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8351)|
| 2:19:20| I understand because I was in that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| But if they are put back in, there is work that needs to be done on the language that was in Option D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8363)|
| 2:19:30| Oh, hey, it really disappoints me that it didn't get looked at in this past two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8370)|
| 2:19:36| Now, I don't know where we are, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| I need you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| Mr. Hall, maybe you want to make a quick comment, and then I'll go to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| I don't know where I got this, but I was under the understanding that those type signs that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8385)|
| 2:19:51| that your typical gas station has that has electronic numbers, that that, in fact, is an electronic message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8391)|
| 2:19:59| They just don't use it to that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8401)|
| 2:20:02| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8403)|
| 2:20:04| Well, the one that is a neon, you know, it's a square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| It's got four things or three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| Well, we're not talking about Walgreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| If you're talking neon, neon is permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| Neon doesn't change ever by computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| It's got no, this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| See, my understanding is an electronic message center has a series of dots that arrange themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8422)|
| 2:20:29| And with neon, you can change just like you do on a calculator where you have the eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| Now, I think that's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| Neon is a tube.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| Yeah, but tubes, you can turn on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| Just like on your calculator, you have eight lines that form all the different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| And my sense is that's what they do with neon, and that's not an electronic message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8449)|
| 2:20:50| But most of them, many of them, have the pixels, as you say, the bulbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| We've permitted a great number of those throughout the city, Councilwoman Peebles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| And we've had them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| I mean, they've showed up since the ban went into effect, so I assume these were not EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| New ones have shown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8471)|
| 2:21:12| I haven't been checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| I'm not aware of any new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| I'm not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| I'm not aware of any complaints that we've had about any new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| Neither am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Would you say that one of those, you're the person that would be inspecting these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8480)|
| 2:21:25| Would you say that they're an electronic message center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| The ones you described just a minute ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| They are a type of electronic message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| That was my point, and I think that's what Ms. Pelow was trying to save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| I didn't do it well, but I certainly was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8499)|
| 2:21:47| Did you make a motion or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| I was looking at my buddy over there in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| There was and there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8513)|
| 2:21:54| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8514)|
| 2:21:55| Based on what I've heard this evening, I'm going to vote against the amendment that's on the floor tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| I think that we need to discuss making a provision for changeable price signs for hotels and gas stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| and whoever else wants to show their prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| But I think from what Mrs. Cash has told us, we don't have enough good information about how to regulate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8528)|
| 2:22:15| because in reality they are EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| And I think, I mean, a gas station could put up their buy now instead of $2.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8537)|
| 2:22:23| And so I think we or as Ms. Cash said, the size issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| You know, it could say $2.99 huge, not $2.99 like we're used to looking at fitting on the gas station sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| So I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| I would like to see a provision for changeable signs, but I feel like I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| And when do you think that would occur, next November or maybe next January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| That would be wise, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| Ms. Poplin is going to make a quick comment, maybe for some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| Just for a point of clarification dealing with the gas price changers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| and the question of whether those are looked at as EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| The one that was actually brought to our attention and we did review during the moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| we did advise that that was covered by the ban and a permit wasn't issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8585)|
| 2:23:10| One that was brought to our attention and asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| So I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| I'm going to agree with Ms. Roddy and for the reasons she stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| It's unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| I mean, actually, what you're talking about I think is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| I'm very worried about the loopholes that we had, the lack of clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| and I think we do need to think it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| And I actually was under a little different impression about what was being considered an EMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8611)|
| 2:23:36| and I apologize because I was not on the same wavelength you were on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| That is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| There is a motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| Better do a quick roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8634)|
| 2:23:55| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| What are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| Returning changeable price signs, amendment number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| Are we voting to add that back in or are we voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| To make those permissible, I think is what Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| Becker said, was to make them permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| That's what we're voting on right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| Well, I thought somebody said something about a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8658)|
| 2:24:22| I'm going to have to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| I think we need to get some regulations on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| I think we need them, but I think that, you know, based on what I heard, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| we don't have any kind of definition or defining parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| So we need to do that very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| But I'm going to say no because we don't have enough meat on the bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| So that's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| So I have to go ahead then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| Councilman Pillow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| I heard three ayes and six noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Now, let me come back and ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| How do we have a study on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| Let me throw something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| Let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| What if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| Councilman Becker's resolution next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| Well, let me suggest something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| What if next time we had three or four representations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| and then we could have a clarification of that's what I mean, that's not what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| That was basically what I was hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| But it's misunderstood and I don't think I presented that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| I'd like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| That would allow it to still be brought up next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| We could have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| You could have some representations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| And, I mean, part of the thing is I think everybody's envisioning something different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| I think we are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| So that would be my suggestion is that we leave it alone for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| Maybe we'll get to the next meeting and somebody can be responsible for having three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8739)|
| 2:25:43| or four representations and say, this is what I like, this is what I don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| Well, if we're going to do that, this vote just kept us from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8751)|
| 2:25:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8752)|
| 2:25:53| We had to have that vote reconsidered, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| Oh, you'll be back on second reading next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| And we just voted not to put this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| You voted not to put it in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| You can come back on second reading and put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| Then you'll be on first reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8767)|
| 2:26:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| So we're going to do what the mayor suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| We need to rescind this vote we just did, leave it in, and bring those examples back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| And then next time, if we want to, we could take it out, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| Somebody would have to, somebody who voted against it would have to vote to reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| Am I right on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| Let me, Mr. Shilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8786)|
| 2:26:27| It just failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8787)|
| 2:26:28| You could, I guess you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| You could move to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| Somebody who voted on the prevailing side could move to reconsider that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8794)|
| 2:26:40| Move to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| Does the second have to come from another reconsiderer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| I mean, from another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| A second could come from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| Parliamentary question, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| I understand what Mr. Brown is saying that and what I think his intention is, is to allow us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8816)|
| 2:27:03| what we're going to be doing with this and still pass it on second reading in two weeks, which is noble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| And I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| If we pass Ms. Pillow's motion and then we come back in two weeks and we say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8829)|
| 2:27:15| we've got to add this page of regulations to it, is that a substantive change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| You do something that's substantively materially different than what you're doing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| then it will be a substantive change that has to go back to first reading, unless, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| you decide you'll just pass it on emergency at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| Well, the mayor's suggestion was bring some examples so we at least all know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| It wasn't talking about all the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| So I want to allow us the opportunity to see those examples so we're all getting the same visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8863)|
| 2:27:48| And so it didn't envision doing what Bob was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| And I wanted to keep it alive so that we could see those visuals and then know for sure because I think at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8871)|
| 2:27:57| as far as I'm concerned because I want to ask somebody, is that clock up there an EMC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| But, you know, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| You know, I'm hearing all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| I'm kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| It's going to change in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| So that's what I'm trying to do, not get the regulations, but give us an opportunity to look at these examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8885)|
| 2:28:11| so we're all clear on what is an EMC with regards to these pricing signs and what is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| And I've heard from four people who are fairly well versed in this that you have different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8897)|
| 2:28:23| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| Mr. Brown, let me ask an opinion for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| I'm willing to vote for the motion if we get an understanding that in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8906)|
| 2:28:31| if we look at this and it is really confusing, that we're willing to deal with the issue then as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8917)|
| 2:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| That's what we do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| And if it's not, if it is as simple as you all hope, we actually can move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| We need to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| Do I actually have a motion to reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| In a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8935)|
| 2:28:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8937)|
| 2:28:58| We're going to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| This is to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8942)|
| 2:29:03| We're voting now to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8943)|
| 2:29:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8944)|
| 2:29:05| All those in favor of reconsideration, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8948)|
| 2:29:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| Now back to reconsidering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8950)|
| 2:29:11| Anybody want to back on amendment, excuse me, amendment number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8951)|
| 2:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8956)|
| 2:29:17| So is it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| It's automatically back on the floor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| Let's vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8967)|
| 2:29:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| Ms. Cash, I'm going to give you the job of bringing examples that folks can look at just so that everybody knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8970)|
| 2:29:37| we have something we're talking off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| We're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8981)|
| 2:29:42| One other thing, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| I want to make sure that I understand this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| Are we putting back in the language that was deleted out of option D last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8993)|
| 2:29:54| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| In my opinion, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| Putting back language that provides for changeable price signs for one item is what I understood her motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| That actually was in option D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| That was in option D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| And so on page 12 and 19 of your highlighted copy, we would add an exception, which would be number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9006)|
| 2:30:14| which would be changeable price signs with a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| There was one in option D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9019)|
| 2:30:22| It's actually option D is in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9022)|
| 2:30:25| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9025)|
| 2:30:26| So this would actually be taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| E1M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9030)|
| 2:30:37| If you want me just to read what it said, that would probably be easier as it was in option D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9037)|
| 2:30:42| One of the exceptions would be to allow a changeable price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| And it states, EMC used as changeable price signs may be integrated into a business ground sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9046)|
| 2:30:52| or monument sign or may be placed on a gas pump canopy in accordance with these regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9052)|
| 2:30:59| except that there is no minimum matrix area and the matrix area shall not exceed 20 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9059)|
| 2:31:05| For the purposes of these regulations, a changeable price sign is one that shows a product or service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9065)|
| 2:31:12| such as fuel or hotel motel room as an unchanging element of the sign and only the price is changeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9072)|
| 2:31:25| That's what you're going to bring is new language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| Mr. Becker has had an O-line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| Probably was, but only knows what it was for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9089)|
| 2:31:39| Any other comments from anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9099)|
| 2:31:50| So now we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9110)|
| 2:31:55| The ordinance, excuse me, the ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| Fourth time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9118)|
| 2:31:59| With number four in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| That was painless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| Eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9132)|
