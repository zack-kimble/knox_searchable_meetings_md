| 2:44:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| Janine Vigarte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9876)|
| 2:44:41| Give us your address, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| Janine de la Torre Vigarte, 1117 Kevin Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| And I'm here to oppose funding of 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| When I became a U.S. citizen, I knew that I would get involved in my community and vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9893)|
| 2:44:59| but I never imagined that I would one day be standing here speaking before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9899)|
| 2:45:04| So thank you very much for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| I would like to read a statement by the immigrant and ally women that they presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| at the community forum against 287G on May of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9912)|
| 2:45:18| On May 2nd, a group of immigrants and ally women came together to hear the stories of immigrant women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9918)|
| 2:45:24| women with deep roots in Tennessee, women from all walks of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| We came to learn and to share our stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| and to take a stand against the proposed 287G agreement in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9931)|
| 2:45:37| We lift up the stories of women because women, as primary caregivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9937)|
| 2:45:42| bear the brunt of the anti-immigrant policies that destroy families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9942)|
| 2:45:47| These are stories of strength, courage, perseverance, and resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| We heard the stories of immigrant women, like Rosie, who works hard for her community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9951)|
| 2:45:57| and now faces the possible deportation of her son to a country where she fears for his safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9957)|
| 2:46:03| Juana, who was forced to give birth in shackles under the 287G program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| and who is now a powerful activist speaking out against 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9968)|
| 2:46:14| Alisa, who fears that her husband will be deported in any moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| and who illustrates the painful Catch-22 in immigration policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| that make it impossible sometimes for many immigrants to gain legal status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9983)|
| 2:46:28| Cynthia, whose family was torn apart when her father was detained and held in ICE custody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9988)|
| 2:46:34| before her 21st birthday, and who speaks of the challenges and struggles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9994)|
| 2:46:39| of living in a family with mixed immigration status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| Sarah, who has seen women in her family lose custody of their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| simply because of their immigration status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10008)|
| 2:46:51| Gloria, who despite surviving a violent attack in Mexico| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10011)|
| 2:46:56| and escaping and coming to the U.S. to protect her life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| is living without immigration papers and deportation could mean a return to the hands of her abusers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10020)|
| 2:47:07| and potential loss of her life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| Kay, who came to the U.S. from Liberia, is grateful that she was welcomed to Tennessee as a refugee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10030)|
| 2:47:16| and who compares the anti-immigrant climate in some places in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| to the emotional trauma endured by women living in a war zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10041)|
| 2:47:26| Christina, who has seen the fabric of community destroyed as her neighbors and friends are detained and deported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10046)|
| 2:47:33| My question is, what kind of Knox County do we want to live in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10053)|
| 2:47:39| I've been here in Knox County for 20 years now, and I hope I will continue to be a welcoming and an opening place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10059)|
| 2:47:46| In all of these stories, we heard several common themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| Women coming here with a simple dream of being safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| and living in a place where hard work is rewarded and where families can be together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| But every story we heard was of families being torn apart, of children suffering, of shattered lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10078)|
| 2:48:06| This reality is familiar to anyone who has experienced a war zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| who has lived in constant fear and lives with the threat of having their children taken from them at any moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10090)|
| 2:48:18| For immigrant women, living under this constant siege means not being able to go to the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10098)|
| 2:48:24| and expect that your family will still be there when you return, or maybe you will not be returning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10104)|
| 2:48:29| Not having to explain to your child what will happen if you are taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10109)|
| 2:48:33| That night we told our personal stories, sharing the light of our truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10113)|
| 2:48:37| because the toxic lies that facilitate anti-immigrant policies cannot stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10117)|
| 2:48:43| We commit to create a brighter Tennessee free from fear and oppression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| We ask with all due respect that you do not fund 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10128)|
| 2:48:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10135)|
| 2:48:56| Is Daniel Snyder back in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| That's all we have signed up, but does anyone else want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10144)|
| 2:49:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10145)|
| 2:49:06| You had the public forum, and I have gotten a new sense of what biblically it is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10146)|
| 2:49:12| Last shall be first, and first can also be last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10152)|
| 2:49:15| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10155)|
| 2:49:16| If you'd give us your name and address for the record, sir, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10158)|
| 2:49:19| My name is John Stewart, 6611 Ridge Rock Lane, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10159)|
| 2:49:26| And I am here this afternoon to express my deep concern over Sheriff Jones' repeated refusal to meet with a group of citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10166)|
| 2:49:37| specifically the allies of Knoxville's immigrant neighbors, or Aiken, as they're sometimes called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10177)|
| 2:49:43| who have peaceably and courteously requested an opportunity to discuss the proposal for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10183)|
| 2:49:50| to participate in the highly controversial 287G program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10190)|
| 2:49:56| I thought I was going to read this right off the bat at the beginning of the council session this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10196)|
| 2:50:03| but you've already seen members of Aiken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| and I think it can be said without fear of contradiction that they are courteous and peaceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10207)|
| 2:50:16| Other speakers this afternoon have discussed the merits and problems associated with the 287G problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10216)|
| 2:50:24| and that was not my purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| I'm here simply to say clearly and without equivocation that elected public officials, like the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10226)|
| 2:50:33| have a responsibility to listen to the people who elected them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10233)|
| 2:50:39| A responsibility to listen to the people who elected them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| They are not bound to agree, but they do have an obligation to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10243)|
| 2:50:48| That is the essence of how our democracy works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10248)|
| 2:50:52| This is especially true when petitioners have come peaceably and responsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10252)|
| 2:50:58| with direct knowledge of the program's operation in other venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10258)|
| 2:51:04| Sheriff Jones simply has refused to speak with his fellow citizens of Knox County on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| Now, I was delighted to hear that he speaks with Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10270)|
| 2:51:13| I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| But as far as the citizens go, he has had office assistants rebuff them on four specific occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10277)|
| 2:51:24| when they came to his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10284)|
| 2:51:26| Repeated phone calls have been ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| And as someone who voted for Sheriff Jones, as I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| and who thinks he's generally a pretty good sheriff, as I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| I say this conduct is neither acceptable nor in the best interests of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10296)|
| 2:51:42| The one element essential in handling a proposal as controversial as 287G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10302)|
| 2:51:49| is establishing an element of trust between elected office holders and citizens at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10309)|
| 2:51:57| Sheriff Jones' behavior, not surprisingly, has had the opposite effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10317)|
| 2:52:03| And it's had a character for him, too, I might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| Now, I'm 77 years old, for better or worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10326)|
| 2:52:11| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10331)|
| 2:52:12| But I've spent a lifetime, truly a lifetime, in public service and in dealing with public issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10332)|
| 2:52:20| from civil rights to the manned space program to rural economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10340)|
| 2:52:26| and to pediatric cancer issues, which are very close to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10346)|
| 2:52:32| I have learned that you cannot disrespect people, and you cannot hide behind your office door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10352)|
| 2:52:39| So Sheriff Jones, open your door, sit down with Aiken, and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10359)|
| 2:52:46| They, in turn, have an obligation to listen to you and seriously consider what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10366)|
| 2:52:53| But this conversation needs to begin, and begin without delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10373)|
| 2:52:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| Susan Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10381)|
| 2:53:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| And if you would give us your address, please, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10388)|
| 2:53:09| Susan Montgomery, 9225 Topico Drive, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10389)|
| 2:53:14| Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10394)|
| 2:53:16| I've come from the faith community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| I serve as the chair of the Outreach Advocacy Ministry Team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10399)|
| 2:53:24| and I am the Refugee Immigrant Ministry Coordinator for the Holston Conference of the United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10404)|
| 2:53:30| In my faith, from the beginning, people of the Bible were on the move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10410)|
| 2:53:34| so much so that we can look at the Bible as an immigration handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10414)|
| 2:53:38| I'm part of a church that makes migrants of its pastors by moving them to different churches on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10418)|
| 2:53:44| On a number of occasions in the Old and New Testaments, God stresses the importance of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10424)|
| 2:53:50| as well as the importance of kindness to widows, children, and aliens, the most vulnerable in society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10430)|
| 2:53:57| We are told, do not mistreat the foreigners who are living in your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| Treat them as you would a fellow Israelite, and love them as you love yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10441)|
| 2:54:05| Remember that you were once foreigners in the land of Egypt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10445)|
| 2:54:09| Many times in his life, Jesus was an undocumented immigrant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| from the flight into Egypt as an infant to his effort to spread the good news in his adult ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10452)|
| 2:54:18| But we often speak out of two places today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| On the one hand, we want to benefit from the labor of migrants and fear they will leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10461)|
| 2:54:26| But at the same time, we accuse them of threatening our national security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10466)|
| 2:54:30| We violate basic human rights by using national security arguments to justify repressive policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10470)|
| 2:54:36| These policies are a tool to divide working people from one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10476)|
| 2:54:40| just as Pharaoh did when he stressed tribal and national origins in his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10480)|
| 2:54:45| It is an illusory security based on artificial racial divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10485)|
| 2:54:50| We have a double standard on migration today that is deeply influenced by race, ethnicity, and class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| Why is someone with financial resources who migrates 1,000 miles to retire in a warmer climate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10496)|
| 2:55:02| welcomed and provided documents, while someone who has lost their land and migrates 50 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10502)|

| 2:55:11| I can give you a personal example to show how arbitrary and discriminatory a law like this could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10511)|
| 2:55:18| Just two months ago, my next-door neighbor, who was brought to this country 20 years ago by his parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10518)|
| 2:55:23| was stopped for a broken taillight on his way home from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| He is now in deportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| This is the man who helped me clean debris off my cracked windshield after last year's hailstorm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10529)|
| 2:55:34| repaired my deck, helped me put gutter guards up on my roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10534)|
| 2:55:38| and called me because he hadn't seen me in a few days and wanted to be sure I was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| He is gone now, but the man who lives across the street from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| and has not spoken to me for the 14 years I've lived there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10546)|
| 2:55:49| even as he stands in my yard while his dog does his business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10549)|
| 2:55:53| is a U.S. citizen and will be here forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| My faith tells me to love both of them, but who helps me feel more secure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10556)|
| 2:56:01| We are now in the same position as people of faith that we were in in the 1950s and 1960s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10561)|
| 2:56:07| when the laws then mandated that we support segregation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10567)|
| 2:56:10| and discrimination against our fellow human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| But our faith tells us to love one another and to practice hospitality toward everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10573)|
| 2:56:18| especially the vulnerable in our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| Sometimes there is a sense of what is right that we have learned from God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| that this loss, 287G, sadly misses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10590)|
| 2:56:31| Is there anyone else that wants to address us on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10591)|
| 2:56:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10596)|
| 2:56:37| Would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| My name is Elizabeth Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| I live at 3721 Tollewa Garden Drive, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10601)|
| 2:56:46| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| I just wanted to follow up and let you know who these people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10608)|
| 2:56:52| and what our mission statement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| We are a KIN and we are allies of Knoxville's immigrant neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10615)|
| 2:57:00| A KIN is a network of people in the Knoxville area whose mission is to encourage dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10620)|
| 2:57:05| about issues related to immigrants and refugees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| build better understanding among immigrants, refugees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| and members of local receiving communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10632)|
| 2:57:15| support and learn from immigrant and refugee communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10635)|
| 2:57:19| as they engage in civic and political life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10639)|
| 2:57:22| promote more just and reasonable policies toward immigration and asylum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10642)|
| 2:57:28| and fostering a welcome atmosphere in which all people are treated with dignity and respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10648)|
| 2:57:33| and recognized for their positive contributions to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10657)|
| 2:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10658)|
| 2:57:39| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10659)|
| 2:57:42| I think that's everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10662)|
| 2:57:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| I just wanted to thank everyone for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| And I wanted to say this is the start of a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10666)|
| 2:57:52| I think that there are a few things that I know from my own research that I've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10672)|
| 2:57:58| that I hope I can help get information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10678)|
| 2:58:04| You know, we already have the Safe Communities Act in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10684)|
| 2:58:10| So if someone is arrested and brought in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10690)|
| 2:58:17| then we have the obligation to notify Customs and Immigration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10697)|
| 2:58:25| and they start that process at this point or at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| of determining whether or not someone is in the country legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| I do know that the concerns that you've all outlined with the 287G are concerns that I've had as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10713)|
| 2:58:44| And I can assure you, too, from conversations that I've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10724)|
| 2:58:47| that local law enforcement also shares these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10727)|
| 2:58:53| These are people who take their jobs very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10733)|
| 2:58:57| and the last thing they want is to have anyone in our community feel like they can't reach out to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10737)|
| 2:59:05| What we're talking about with 287G only applies to our law enforcement officers who work in the detention facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10745)|
| 2:59:19| There won't be any task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| In other communities, this has been seriously abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| And I think that's something that we can learn from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10766)|
| 2:59:31| and those things are not going to happen here if this is implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10771)|
| 2:59:36| I'm very confident in our local law enforcement that our patrol officers will not be deputized as ICE agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10776)|
| 2:59:50| The only reason that we would do this with our correction staff is to speed up the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10790)|
| 2:59:58| so that we don't have people lingering in jail and costing the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10798)|
| 3:00:04| I also know, just from the way the county is set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10804)|
| 3:00:07| that if something is going to cost millions and millions of dollars, it's not going to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10807)|
| 3:00:13| So I think I hope that I can help allay some of the concerns about possible costs for this, about possible abuses of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10813)|
| 3:00:28| And one thing that I have been very pleased with is that I've been able to talk with Sheriff Jones about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10828)|
| 3:00:40| and he has agreed to set up a liaison committee between local law enforcement agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10840)|
| 3:00:47| and the Latino community to help facilitate conversation and communication both ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10847)|
| 3:00:56| so that we can hopefully prevent any misunderstandings before they start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10856)|
| 3:01:03| And I'm grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| In my district, I have a very diverse district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| I have a lot of immigrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| I have a lot of people who are here not just from Central American countries and from Mexico,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10871)|
| 3:01:20| but from Africa and other continents and other nations, a lot of refugees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10880)|
| 3:01:29| And the church that I belong to is a welcoming congregation for homeless families, for immigrants, for refugees, for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10889)|
| 3:01:41| So this is an issue that's very, very close to my own heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| and it's something that I have put a lot of my own time into studying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| And I really am comfortable with where we are at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10908)|
| 3:01:55| and I think that if Sheriff Jones does move forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| there will be definitely a series of public input sessions where more questions can be asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10919)|
| 3:02:09| But I think there has to be more information available to him first before he can pass it on to everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10929)|
| 3:02:18| So I said I'm very comfortable with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10938)|
| 3:02:23| I truly believe that the abuses that have happened in other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10943)|
| 3:02:30| there are going to be safeguards in place to keep them from happening here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10950)|
| 3:02:33| because of the experiences that I've had with Sheriff Jones and our law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10953)|
| 3:02:39| I know that that is not something that he would ever, ever stand for in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10959)|
| 3:02:45| None of us would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| So I would ask that you trust us as we move forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10967)|
| 3:02:52| and we are in turn going to trust you to continue communicating about your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10972)|
| 3:03:00| But I do want to assure you that the concerns that you have are shared also by me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10980)|
| 3:03:05| and by other members of the government in working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10985)|
| 3:03:10| I hope that we can move forward with this without creating undue problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10990)|
| 3:03:16| or undue stress on our community here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=10996)|
| 3:03:21| So I hope that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| I ask you to please keep in contact with me, and we can set up another meeting soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11003)|
| 3:03:28| I'm glad that we were able to do this today where everyone could come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| and express their feelings and thoughts and be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11011)|
| 3:03:37| And I hope that we will keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| I think this is just the first conversation of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| That would be my intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| So does anyone else have any questions about any of this that I could answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11025)|
| 3:03:52| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11032)|
| 3:03:54| Well, I guess I'll, and again, I don't know the timeline for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11034)|
| 3:03:59| but I think you alluded to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11039)|
| 3:04:02| It would be good if these folks could be heard, you know, prior to a decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11042)|
| 3:04:09| So I don't know what the logistics of it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| Would they get something in and then have the public forum that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11052)|
| 3:04:17| or would that be too late?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| I think my understanding is that the sheriff's department is waiting to get the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11060)|
| 3:04:27| of the agreement so that they understand it before they can answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11067)|
| 3:04:32| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11072)|
| 3:04:37| Anyone else have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| If not, we'll move on to the next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| Discussion of the Charter Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11083)|
| 3:04:47| Commissioner Wright, that was you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11089)|
| 3:04:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| The Charter Review Committee meets this coming week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11092)|
| 3:04:56| I do not have in front of me the schedule of possible meeting dates between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11096)|
| 3:05:07| But the thing that there's one discussion item that has not been made a discussion item before the Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11107)|
| 3:05:17| and it's one that I probably said something about a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11117)|
| 3:05:21| and that relates to the size of the districts that we as commissioners represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11121)|
| 3:05:30| It's been my opinion that ever since the downsizing of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11130)|
| 3:05:35| and the formation of two at-large districts that we've probably got ourselves in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11135)|
| 3:05:44| where constituent services are reduced, especially in those districts that are primarily rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11144)|
| 3:05:55| I believe I've made those statements in the past, and I still stand by those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| And I wonder whether or not commission wants to take any discussion upon that issue this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11160)|
| 3:06:11| A third of the Charter Review Committee is us, and I'd like to hear some other discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11171)|
| 3:06:23| If there's not any support among commissioners for that particular situation, then I'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11183)|
| 3:06:34| I guess I have a point of order of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11194)|
| 3:06:38| Can we discuss this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11198)|
| 3:06:40| I mean, this hasn't been noticed, and we will be discussing, deliberated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11200)|
| 3:06:47| Not this aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11207)|
| 3:06:48| There's not a public notice that says we're going to talk about the Charter Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11208)|
| 3:06:54| And it's just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11214)|
| 3:06:55| I'm fine to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11215)|
| 3:06:56| I just want to make sure that we're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| Nothing's gone out to the public that says we'll be talking about that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11218)|
| 3:07:02| I believe we have it just as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| I don't think we're taking any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| As long as we don't take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11226)|
| 3:07:09| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11229)|
| 3:07:10| Yeah, I guess, you know, what I was wondering is what services, according to the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11230)|
| 3:07:16| are we not providing, you know, our citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11236)|
| 3:07:19| I mean, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| I know we get called on a lot of things that really are executive branch decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11241)|
| 3:07:25| You know, when I go back and read the Charter, I hear we're the legislative branch, you know, of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11245)|
| 3:07:32| And we get called about a lot of things that really are executive branch actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11252)|
| 3:07:43| And, you know, I mean, that's one point I'd like to make because, you know, I think if they're not getting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11263)|
| 3:07:49| I know a lot of what I end up spending my time doing is really serving as like a telephone operator or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11269)|
| 3:07:55| sending people to the proper branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| But it's, I mean, most of the things, and I don't know what the percentage are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11277)|
| 3:08:00| but most of the things that we get called about really are executive branch, you know, issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11280)|
| 3:08:05| Zonings are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| And we do have to, you know, go around and look at those if, you know, if a neighborhood has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11287)|
| 3:08:12| But a lot of it really, you know, I mean, these are really, you know, the mayor's office that takes care of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11292)|
| 3:08:18| And then the only other comment that I would have to make about changing this is that in the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11298)|
| 3:08:26| we've had two different redistrictings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| And, you know, I would just be concerned to try to do something again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11310)|
| 3:08:35| You know, it really would just, you know, stir things up and really confuse people as to where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11315)|
| 3:08:41| And we probably ought to give this eight or ten years to see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11321)|
| 3:08:46| I think the commission part is working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| And if there's a problem with the executive branch, maybe we need to bolster that up some if they're not doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11328)|
| 3:08:57| I think that you've hit exactly on the part of the constituent service that I have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11337)|
| 3:09:03| It used to be that the 40,000 people in the 8th District had four ears that they could go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11343)|
| 3:09:09| one on either side of the head of the two individuals that represented the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11349)|
| 3:09:14| That's gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| And in the rural parts of the county, it is the executive branch, the mayor, and me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11356)|
| 3:09:28| We're the only two elected people that anyone in the 8th District might feel like they've got a call into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11368)|
| 3:09:39| So if you wish me to say to the people that call me, Dr. Briggs has no trouble referring all of his calls to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11379)|
| 3:09:48| maybe I should then --is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11388)|
| 3:09:51| Well, no, I mean, we all have calls to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| No, what I'm saying is that we have our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11393)|
| 3:09:57| You know, if there's a street sign missing, you know, I don't put it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11397)|
| 3:10:02| If there's a dog running around loose someplace, I don't go catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11402)|
| 3:10:07| That's somebody else that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| And I think a lot of people, unfortunately, didn't, you know, they don't grasp what they need to do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11409)|
| 3:10:15| maybe from high school civics class or whatever on what the different branches are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11415)|
| 3:10:20| Now, I think we should intervene if they've exhausted, you know, the proper channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11420)|
| 3:10:25| But, I mean, there's very little that I have the authority to tell people to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11425)|
| 3:10:32| You know, if somebody wants a particular resolution brought before the county commission, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11432)|
| 3:10:37| But, I mean, it's probably good politics to go do it, but the truth of the matter is the roads, the libraries, the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11437)|
| 3:10:49| you know, those things are really the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| I mean, those are the responsibility of other elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11452)|
| 3:10:57| Now, if they're not getting action, we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| But, I mean, if you go back and read the county charter, I mean, a lot of these things, we're not even, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11460)|
| 3:11:08| we're not really, I mean, we can get involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11468)|
| 3:11:10| I mean, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11470)|
| 3:11:11| We've gotten involved in the schools that, you know, it's questionable whether we should be doing it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11471)|
| 3:11:17| But, I mean, that's my only thing is that if we have a problem where things aren't getting done by the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11477)|
| 3:11:26| then we need to either, I mean, we need to bolster up so they have the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| I mean, all we can do is give them the resources to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| It's just like the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| If the schools need something, we can give them the resources, but we don't make teacher assignments and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11497)|
| 3:11:44| I mean, it makes people like to call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11504)|
| 3:11:46| I mean, I've gotten called about people's husbands in California that aren't paying child support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11506)|
| 3:11:52| And I can help them to get to the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11512)|
| 3:11:55| But, you know, we're limited with our authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11515)|
| 3:11:59| I think that the first call I received was probably actually before we, you and I, were sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11519)|
| 3:12:05| And it was from someone on Kodak Road, and there was a dead skunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11525)|
| 3:12:10| I'm not really referring to those kinds of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11530)|
| 3:12:15| I think that there are lots of issues that we, as sitting commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11535)|
| 3:12:21| may have the ability to give civic instruction to the citizens of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11541)|
| 3:12:27| to help them better understand what the county does, how it assists them in their daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11547)|
| 3:12:34| And I find us commissioners being shortchanged in the fact that we don't have as much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11554)|
| 3:12:41| We've been cut in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| We don't have as much time to represent those people with the knowledge that we have come upon here at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11563)|
| 3:12:52| The second thing that I kind of roll into to what we're discussing right now is that I see quite a bit of concentration of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11572)|
| 3:13:07| Commissioner Armstrong or Commissioner Ballard, when we were sitting side-by-side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11587)|
| 3:13:15| we may have been able to disagree on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| And a little bit better granularity, a little bit more fine-tuning of what was taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11599)|
| 3:13:28| could be achieved by a larger number of people collecting data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11608)|
| 3:13:34| So, as you see right now, you mentioned zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11614)|
| 3:13:38| We have to go to all these things about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| In a minute, we will be discussing a zoning in which my staff and the staff car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11621)|
| 3:13:53| we traveled Sunday a week ago 102 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11633)|
| 3:13:57| looking at various things that have taken place in Knox County over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11637)|
| 3:14:02| That's a concentration of the thought process in denying people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11642)|
| 3:14:08| But more than that, the two commissioners that are at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11648)|
| 3:14:13| and I'll point either direction right now and say I've done this in lots of settings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11653)|
| 3:14:23| I do not most of the time deviate from the conservative feelings of those two fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11663)|
| 3:14:36| It's not normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11676)|
| 3:14:37| It's not normal for me to go against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| And I find that in one instance, looking this way for a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11680)|
| 3:14:48| if I can go to two things in a day, or, yeah, let me say, if I can go to two things in a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11688)|
| 3:14:55| he's already been to one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| He's going to another one in between the other one I'm going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| and then he's got another one after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| Now, maybe he's changing his schedule a little bit, but the goings-on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11701)|
| 3:15:11| I did go to something the other night, and he wasn't there, and somebody asked me where he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11711)|
| 3:15:16| Hit me later if I did or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11716)|
| 3:15:23| The reason that I want this to be sort of an easygoing part of what I'm discussing is the point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11723)|
| 3:15:32| it will not always be the two commissioners that are at large with us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11732)|
| 3:15:38| The next time those races are contested, they'll truly be countywide and partisan and expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11738)|
| 3:15:47| We find right now that there's some good headline fodder about campaign funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11747)|
| 3:15:58| The issue of funds that's making the headlines is more money than I spent total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11758)|
| 3:16:06| That issue of money is more money than I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11766)|
| 3:16:12| What happens conversely now is that those two at-large seats are going to begin to be more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11772)|
| 3:16:19| And I don't want to look at the ones that are sitting here with us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11779)|
| 3:16:27| I want it to be thought about in the future days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11787)|
| 3:16:30| We started with 19 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| We can all say that that was a hectic time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| but I don't think that the public sentiment was against the seats that are sitting here, the chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11794)|
| 3:16:43| I believe it was against the people that were occupying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11803)|
| 3:16:46| And that we have changed by virtue of the fact that we're a smaller group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11806)|
| 3:16:52| We do get along rather well, except every now and then I'm going to have to start elbowing my ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11812)|
| 3:17:00| on some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11820)|
| 3:17:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11822)|
| 3:17:03| So I'm not going to pick on ---- I'm not picking on anyone here because of you as to all be 100 percent friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11823)|
| 3:17:15| I'm looking at the very issue that Dr. Briggs raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11835)|
| 3:17:19| What will it be like eight and ten years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| We know what it took to blast politics in Knox County in the direction it's headed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11843)|
| 3:17:34| We know what it took for us to get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11854)|
| 3:17:37| We know what it's like for us to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11857)|
| 3:17:41| But when we start saying two at-large commissioners, I hope I've developed a couple of points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11861)|
| 3:17:47| I've found that there are not as many ears out there for commissioners, for constituents to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11867)|
| 3:17:56| I just really left something out there a moment ago, but I need to talk about Blount County or Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11876)|
| 3:18:02| I thought it interesting in one of the Sunday morning programs about Anderson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11882)|
| 3:18:07| and the number of people that live in Anderson County and the hotly contested race they have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11887)|
| 3:18:13| It'd be like Larry and I campaigning for who's going to be the mayor of the 7th and 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11893)|
| 3:18:20| That's what we're comparing when we compare Knox County and Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11900)|
| 3:18:24| And they have 100 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11904)|
| 3:18:28| Or Blount County, they have several more commissioners than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11908)|
| 3:18:32| And the reason they have them, sort of like the way we used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11912)|
| 3:18:36| so that people out there on the street could easily get a hold of someone who was not in a full-time job as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11916)|
| 3:18:45| Commissioners that are brain surgeons or Oak Ridge operators have a lot more to worry about than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11925)|
| 3:18:55| And I find it stressing that I said brain surgeon, didn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11935)|
| 3:19:00| Dr. Briggs, you're a heart surgeon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| The brain is the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| I'd rather you worked on the heart because I know a couple you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11946)|
| 3:19:11| That can be fixed, and it's a good hand that can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11951)|
| 3:19:16| That's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11956)|
| 3:19:17| So we've gone through two things here about why the numbers, to me, don't really work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11957)|
| 3:19:31| And a last point, the nine commissioners or the two per district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11971)|
| 3:19:41| there's a math problem here that people keep bringing up to me that every district was represented by two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11981)|
| 3:19:52| And now that math doesn't work out to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11992)|
| 3:19:58| And it's a complex math problem of fractions and decimal points, whichever way you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=11998)|
| 3:20:06| But it's for sure that it's difficult for minority representation to rise to the level of being at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12006)|
| 3:20:17| So I really believe there are three distinctly important points that I'm wanting to bring in front of us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12017)|
| 3:20:28| Three really strong, important points about how commission is made up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12028)|
| 3:20:34| and what I want to say is, is it fair or is it cost effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12034)|
| 3:20:41| And I'm talking now to campaigns, countywide versus a district campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12041)|
| 3:20:47| And then representation when it comes to who can make it into being one of the two countywides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12047)|
| 3:20:57| So I'm sorry that it took me so long to get that out, but you know how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12057)|
| 3:21:01| This is the way we've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12061)|
| 3:21:03| This is the big room is the only place you can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12063)|
| 3:21:07| Mr. Briggs, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12067)|
| 3:21:08| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12068)|
| 3:21:10| You know, they say you need to find common ground if you're going to reach agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12070)|
| 3:21:13| The one thing that I would agree with you completely on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12073)|
| 3:21:16| and this is with all due respect to our two at-large commissioners, that, you know, I agree that that is an oddity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12076)|
| 3:21:24| And, you know, if I had my druthers, we would have nine commissioners, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12084)|
| 3:21:29| That's just personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12089)|
| 3:21:30| I think 18 ears, you know, are a lot of ears for people to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12090)|
| 3:21:35| I consider myself to represent all the, you know, all the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12095)|
| 3:21:41| As a matter of fact, right here on my very – since we've been sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12101)|
| 3:21:44| I just sent an e-mail just a second ago to a person that – he does not live in my district, but he's been concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12104)|
| 3:21:51| You may have seen the general e-mail to the person who's trying to get the quiet zones on the railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12111)|
| 3:21:56| Not in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12116)|
| 3:21:57| We've had – I think this is the sixth e-mail correspondence in the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12117)|
| 3:22:02| And I try to answer all the – even the general ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12122)|
| 3:22:05| But – and there's been a lot of other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| I've had somebody out where you live that's interested in chickens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| And – but the point being – I mean, the point being is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12132)|
| 3:22:17| even though I was elected by a certain group of people, I'm a Knox County commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12137)|
| 3:22:21| And I think just the smaller – you know, if you talk to a lot of people, you talk to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12141)|
| 3:22:26| You talk to Larry Waters, who's the mayor over in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12146)|
| 3:22:30| They have a lot of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12150)|
| 3:22:31| I think they've got quite a few in Blount and some of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12151)|
| 3:22:35| And just the smaller groups, I think, work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12155)|
| 3:22:38| And it was the same argument that I made about the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12158)|
| 3:22:41| I think nine pension board members, you know, were fine rather than the 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12161)|
| 3:22:45| You know, it's just a personal preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| I think you can work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| And I think a lot of it is having – I just find a lot of what I do is directing traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12169)|
| 3:22:58| I mean, I can go out and look and see how big the sign is at Strang when they want a bigger sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12178)|
| 3:23:03| but that's really the engineering – you know, that's the engineering department that makes the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12183)|
| 3:23:10| But there's just a lot of things, I think, that we do that are not – it's not really our job to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12190)|
| 3:23:16| but we can help people be directed into the right place because they don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12196)|
| 3:23:23| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12203)|
| 3:23:24| I want to get to the other commissioners who have their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12204)|
| 3:23:27| We're getting down to the wire here on getting something on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12207)|
| 3:23:31| Mr. Jarrett or Mr. – is David here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12211)|
| 3:23:38| If we were going to get something on the ballot, we really needed to do something this month and next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12218)|
| 3:23:42| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12222)|
| 3:23:43| August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12223)|
| 3:23:44| I believe the end of August is kind of the deadline because it has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12224)|
| 3:23:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12228)|
| 3:23:49| You've got overseas ballots to contend with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12229)|
| 3:23:51| You've got to, likewise, be able to draft the language in legally defensible form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| and then get it to Cliff Rogers to ensure he can get the overseas ballots done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12236)|
| 3:24:01| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12241)|
| 3:24:02| So as far as getting it through this body, it might be difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12242)|
| 3:24:05| but the charter review still has meetings that could be brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12245)|
| 3:24:09| I guess the only thing that I would mention as being an at-large person is this is what the voters voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12249)|
| 3:24:14| This is what they said they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12254)|
| 3:24:17| And so Mr. Shouse and I ran for these at-large seats because I believe there was even a court challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12257)|
| 3:24:24| as to whether or not that that was proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| And the courts have said, yes, it was proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| And so this is what the voters have said that they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| Now, if the voters –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12271)|
| 3:24:32| Mr. Chairman, pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12272)|
| 3:24:34| The courts said there was no standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12274)|
| 3:24:37| But the courts allowed it to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12277)|
| 3:24:41| I mean, we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| No one challenged it's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12284)|
| 3:24:46| I've had my light on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12286)|
| 3:24:48| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| I was just saying that I was just making a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| So my point is that the citizens have voted that this is what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12291)|
| 3:24:56| And if the citizens want to vote otherwise, I'm all in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12296)|
| 3:24:59| If they want to vote for anything, I don't care because I want what the citizens want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12299)|
| 3:25:03| But the bottom line, I think, is that this is what they voted on, and this is the body that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12303)|
| 3:25:09| So, Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12311)|
| 3:25:12| I'm in agreement with Dave on most of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12312)|
| 3:25:18| And if we're going to get it on the ballot, we're going to have to move fast because any changes that we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12318)|
| 3:25:28| if the voters vote to make any changes, those changes can't take place until 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12328)|
| 3:25:36| And if we don't get it on the ballot this year, that means we can't vote on it until 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12336)|
| 3:25:43| And at that point, it will push it forward another election cycle before any changes can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12343)|
| 3:25:49| So – because there will have to be an adjustment made in terms of term length for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12349)|
| 3:25:59| In my district, people I've talked to aren't happy with at-large representation, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12359)|
| 3:26:07| and that's nothing against Mike or Ed, but Ed's come to a couple meetings and Happy Holler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12367)|
| 3:26:17| and Mike's been – he came to a Thanksgiving dinner that we did a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12377)|
| 3:26:23| I have been in your district several times, meeting with several people on several different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12383)|
| 3:26:27| So just because I haven't been to an organized meeting doesn't mean I haven't been in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12387)|
| 3:26:31| No, and I wasn't suggesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12391)|
| 3:26:34| But I can tell you that as far as neighborhood meetings and community groups and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12394)|
| 3:26:39| there's really more than you all are able to attend on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12399)|
| 3:26:45| And those sorts of things are not where people – people don't see you at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12405)|
| 3:26:51| So I know that – I mean, I'm fortunate in that my district is quite compact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12411)|
| 3:26:57| so I don't have the geographical problem that Dave has and that Mike has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12417)|
| 3:27:04| But I do think that with us shrinking from two commissioners per district to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12424)|
| 3:27:10| it makes sense to shrink the size of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12430)|
| 3:27:12| I'd be happy with, you know, 11 smaller districts or even 13 smaller districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12432)|
| 3:27:17| I don't think that's creating a commission that's too large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12437)|
| 3:27:22| But I do know that, you know, the people in my district don't necessarily feel like they're being represented by three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12442)|
| 3:27:30| And I know that that's an argument that's been made in favor of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12450)|
| 3:27:34| now instead of having two people per district, there's really three people per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12454)|
| 3:27:38| So it's – and there's no way that at-large representatives can represent everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12458)|
| 3:27:50| There's just too much diversity in too many different positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12470)|
| 3:27:55| So that's not meant at all as a criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12475)|
| 3:28:00| So I would personally prefer to see smaller districts and a few more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12480)|
| 3:28:07| And I'd be happy to, you know, move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12487)|
| 3:28:11| But if the majority isn't interested in that, you know, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12491)|
| 3:28:16| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12496)|
| 3:28:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12499)|
| 3:28:21| A lot of good points have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| And Amy just brought up one of the most important, and that is the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12503)|
| 3:28:29| While she can walk across her district, Dave and I would have to get a camel if we wanted to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12509)|
| 3:28:36| because we'd need that much water to get across them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| If he lives out in Coreton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| and his district comes all the way around up until very recently to Chapman Highway in Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12521)|
| 3:28:48| he has to pack a lunch to get there practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12528)|
| 3:28:55| You talked about being the go-to person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12535)|
| 3:28:58| Is that a legislative problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12538)|
| 3:29:00| Is that our problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12540)|
| 3:29:02| When you're elected commissioner in a rural district, you're the one the people look to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12542)|
| 3:29:07| You're the representative that they look to when that possum gets caught in the hen house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12547)|
| 3:29:13| or the tree fell down on Mrs. Jones' power line or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12553)|
| 3:29:19| They don't call 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12559)|
| 3:29:20| They call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12560)|
| 3:29:22| Some of the strange calls we get, you would not believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12562)|
| 3:29:27| But we know where to pass those on to to get the job done, and that's what I see as our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12567)|
| 3:29:39| But Dave is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| When we cut it down, we cut down the representation of the people by half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12581)|
| 3:29:46| I don't care about the two at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12586)|
| 3:29:50| I know you guys are spread thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12590)|
| 3:29:54| But the biggest reason against at large is I mentioned this before here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12594)|
| 3:30:01| There are a bunch of qualified people to sit in these seats across Knox County that can't afford to run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12601)|
| 3:30:10| certainly for those two countywide seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12610)|
| 3:30:13| I mean, you've got to be J. Paul Getty or Donald Trump practically to be able to run for an at large seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12613)|
| 3:30:20| whether it's for sheriff or whether it's for register of deeds, you know, trustee, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12620)|
| 3:30:26| Those big races cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12626)|
| 3:30:28| That should not be a factor on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12628)|
| 3:30:35| That should be more equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12635)|
| 3:30:38| Amy mentioned about going to 11 or even 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| If we want to keep the districts, commission districts the same as the school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12642)|
| 3:30:48| we would be limited to 13 because that's the max that the state will allow for school board, 13 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12648)|
| 3:30:56| So I'd be in favor of going to additional districts, even, you know, 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12656)|
| 3:31:03| That's maybe an unlucky number, but it might be lucky for this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12663)|
| 3:31:07| That would do away by redistricting the 13 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12667)|
| 3:31:10| That would do away the at large seats and put everything back on an even keel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12670)|
| 3:31:16| Everybody would have a smaller piece of turf to represent and be able to do a better job at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12676)|
| 3:31:26| So you'd be in favor of also the four school board members additional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12686)|
| 3:31:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12690)|
| 3:31:31| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12691)|
| 3:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12692)|
| 3:31:33| I'll agree with some of the things that have been said and disagree with some, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12693)|
| 3:31:36| My preference was I like the 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12696)|
| 3:31:38| I thought our county was served well by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12698)|
| 3:31:42| There was a reaction, an overreaction to that, in my opinion, probably because of the Black Wednesday situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12702)|
| 3:31:48| and just throw them all out and maybe went out with a bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| And there was a very well organized effort to and well financed, as we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12712)|
| 3:31:57| effort to put this thing on the ballot and reduce it to nine districts and two at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12717)|
| 3:32:03| And so I sort of played with the hand that I was dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12723)|
| 3:32:07| It is difficult to Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| I sometimes have six or seven things I want to do on Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12729)|
| 3:32:12| I can do two or three, sometimes maybe four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12732)|
| 3:32:15| But nevertheless, I think as the chairman just said a few minutes ago, it's been in place less than two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12735)|
| 3:32:22| I think it's relatively early or way too early to say this is all a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12742)|
| 3:32:27| Let's start over and what's the magic number, 17, 13, 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12747)|
| 3:32:32| I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12752)|
| 3:32:34| It is easier to, I think from experience in two years in the fourth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12754)|
| 3:32:39| it's easier to work in nine or ten precincts, 35,000, 40,000 people than 93 precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12759)|
| 3:32:46| But nevertheless, I think I would like the status quo right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12766)|
| 3:32:50| or I think we would be well served to give it another few years to see how things work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12770)|
| 3:32:56| And there's those staggered term situations to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12776)|
| 3:33:00| Four of us are in four-year terms and seven of us are in six-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12780)|
| 3:33:05| So that's going to be sort of a jumbled up mess there, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12785)|
| 3:33:10| But I'm in favor of leaving it as it is for the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12790)|
| 3:33:14| Mr. Wright, do you want to go or do you want Mr. Brown to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12794)|
| 3:33:21| I have one quick point I wanted to make and I forgot it while I was talking, which is not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12801)|
| 3:33:27| But it was mentioned earlier that this is what the people voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12807)|
| 3:33:32| that they wanted nine districts and two at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12812)|
| 3:33:36| If you remember how that was put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12816)|
| 3:33:38| the county commission would not vet those nine different amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12818)|
| 3:33:45| So in order to get them on the ballot at all, they had to be grouped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12825)|
| 3:33:50| The part about changing the side of the commission was the third item in one paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12830)|
| 3:33:57| And I guarantee you that there wasn't three people out of ten that read that full paragraph before they voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12837)|
| 3:34:06| They looked at the first one, they agreed with it, and that's what they voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12846)|
| 3:34:11| Because I can tell you, and not just my district, I'm talking about all over this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12851)|
| 3:34:15| when did we vote to cut it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12855)|
| 3:34:18| Well, you did when you voted like two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12858)|
| 3:34:22| It was brought on, this problem was brought about by inaction of a previous commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12862)|
| 3:34:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12874)|
| 3:34:35| Some of the things that have come by us here in just a moment, I was talking about telephone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12875)|
| 3:34:40| Yes, when the wind blew a couple of weeks ago, my cell phone rang, and I was in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12880)|
| 3:34:48| And I didn't know that the roof had blown off my dad's barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12888)|
| 3:34:53| But I also didn't know that two or three other people that were wanting to know then on Saturday, Saturday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12893)|
| 3:35:01| why KUB hadn't been out there to fix their power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12901)|
| 3:35:04| And would I call someone with KUB and tell them that I was concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12904)|
| 3:35:14| This is not an issue that needs to be tied to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12914)|
| 3:35:17| The school board can have as many school board members as they want or don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12917)|
| 3:35:22| We've just gone through an exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12922)|
| 3:35:24| If we were going to have nine districts and they have nine to make them look alike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12924)|
| 3:35:28| maybe the school board might prefer that we had 13 districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12928)|
| 3:35:32| because then we wouldn't be playing in their sandbox of their nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12932)|
| 3:35:37| They could have their nine districts the way they want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12937)|
| 3:35:40| And the talk that there are three commissioners for each district right now gets into that math problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12940)|
| 3:35:47| There's really only one commissioner in each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12947)|
| 3:35:51| You get a ninth off two other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12951)|
| 3:35:54| So, really, you only have one and two ninths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12954)|
| 3:36:00| And then speaking of the this is my last comment that I had also left off earlier, speaking to countywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12960)|
| 3:36:13| and how does that relate to other legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12973)|
| 3:36:20| I know, well, I know Harry Brooks and Ryan Haynes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12980)|
| 3:36:27| and I could name off three or four other state legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12987)|
| 3:36:30| but they have an area, a community of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12990)|
| 3:36:34| I don't know that there are any statewide state legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=12994)|
| 3:36:41| Just as we are looking to maybe elect a senator from the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13001)|
| 3:36:48| I don't know of any nationwide senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13008)|
| 3:36:52| So there's something about this step up and scaling to larger people to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13012)|
| 3:37:01| It may cause us problems down the road that might lead to other legal challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13021)|
| 3:37:11| And I see the law director over here reared back and looking at me like, where is this fellow headed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13031)|
| 3:37:18| But you need to follow my train of thought here in that how does that work whenever we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13038)|
| 3:37:26| do you have three district representatives or do you have two and one ninth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13046)|
| 3:37:31| or did you used to have two representatives in a district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13051)|
| 3:37:35| How does that affect the representation of the minority groups as represented in here on county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13055)|
| 3:37:44| I brought this up to try to drum up some support for a little bit of constructive discussion at the upcoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13064)|
| 3:37:56| if not this particular week's set of charter review, but maybe at the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13076)|
| 3:38:03| But this is a place where we can discuss it and not vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13083)|
| 3:38:12| And then you'll have heard my thoughts tonight and be able to refute me at some point down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13092)|
| 3:38:22| Two readings, though, this commission can put that on the ballot without going through the charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13102)|
| 3:38:29| If it's going to be on this vote, it's going to have to happen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| Otherwise, it would need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13112)|
| 3:38:33| Special meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13113)|
| 3:38:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13114)|
| 3:38:36| Do we have to have some forums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13116)|
| 3:38:38| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13118)|
| 3:38:39| We have to have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13119)|
| 3:38:40| Yes, we have to have two readings plus we have to have a public forum on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13120)|
| 3:38:46| Our next discussion item is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13126)|
| 3:38:48| Discussion on the letter to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13128)|
| 3:38:51| Letter to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13131)|
| 3:38:52| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13132)|
| 3:38:53| I sent to the chamber a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13133)|
| 3:38:57| I move we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| Is there anything, any other discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13140)|
| 3:39:04| Oh, you'd ask Commissioner Norman, you'd ask about Commissioner, I mean not Commissioner, but Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13144)|
| 3:39:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13149)|
| 3:39:10| Mark, would you speak to the ordinance delay, subregs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13150)|
| 3:39:23| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13163)|
| 3:39:24| Chamber, Mark Donaldson, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13164)|
| 3:39:27| On your agenda this evening are two items that were initiated as a result of the recommendations that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13167)|
| 3:39:37| in the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13177)|
| 3:39:40| They're related but significantly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13180)|
| 3:39:44| One is a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance to provide flexibility within the planned residential zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13184)|
| 3:39:56| if the property happens to lie within the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13196)|
| 3:40:03| That is item number 0127101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13203)|
| 3:40:09| Planning Commission has recommended approval of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| This is your opportunity to decide whether the recommendations of the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13211)|
| 3:40:18| and Ridgetop Plan should be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13218)|
| 3:40:22| The other item is 4B120A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13222)|
| 3:40:26| which is a set of amendments to the subdivision regulations that were adopted by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13226)|
| 3:40:35| Your role is a bit different with regard to the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13235)|
| 3:40:39| The state law provides the authority to adopt and amend the subdivision regulations to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13239)|
| 3:40:46| but somewhere along the line the Knox County Commission adopted the subdivision regulations into their code of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13246)|
| 3:40:55| This item on your agenda is our request for you to make the same amendments to the version of the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13255)|
| 3:41:03| that lie within your code of ordinances so that they remain the same as the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13263)|
| 3:41:10| that are officially adopted by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13270)|
| 3:41:13| Those amendments are a set of alternative development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13273)|
| 3:41:21| for development within the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Area as recommended by the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13281)|
| 3:41:27| They essentially reduce the minimum requirements that developers are obliged to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13287)|
| 3:41:37| such as going from a 50-foot right-of-way down to a 40-foot right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13297)|
| 3:41:43| going from a 26-foot street cross-section down to a 20-foot street cross-section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13303)|
| 3:41:51| going from curb and gutter to going without curb and gutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13311)|
| 3:41:55| So in all cases, these proposed amendments reduce the development standards for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13315)|
| 3:42:05| within the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Area to reduce costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13325)|
| 3:42:09| and to reduce the impact that street development would have on the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13329)|
| 3:42:15| within the steep slopes and ridgetops of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13335)|
| 3:42:20| So we have those two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13340)|
| 3:42:23| They're slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13343)|
| 3:42:24| You have slightly different roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13344)|
| 3:42:26| They're both related to the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13346)|
| 3:42:30| With regard to the zoning ordinance, this is your opportunity to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13350)|
| 3:42:35| whether the recommendations of the plan were worth implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13355)|
| 3:42:38| This is a recommendation that was made on page 40 of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13358)|
| 3:42:43| as well as the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13363)|
| 3:42:46| With regard to the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13366)|
| 3:42:48| your role is simply to keep your version of the subregs consistent with the Planning Commission version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13368)|
| 3:42:54| the Planning Commission having the authority granted by the state to adopt and to amend those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13374)|
| 3:43:04| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13384)|
| 3:43:07| Yes, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13387)|
| 3:43:08| Okay, and I guess this is for Brad or for representatives from the Chamber, whoever wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13388)|
| 3:43:17| I'm just wondering about the delay and why the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13397)|
| 3:43:21| Why do we need to put this off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| Well, the reason for the delay was because it was an issue that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13403)|
| 3:43:28| when we voted on the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13408)|
| 3:43:32| we discussed it being suggestive in nature in what we call the Briggs Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13412)|
| 3:43:38| And I haven't had time to delve into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13418)|
| 3:43:42| You know, we got it, you know, 10 days ago, 10 or 12 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13422)|
| 3:43:46| I think it's appropriate to look into it more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13426)|
| 3:43:49| make sure that it doesn't encumber what the legislative intent of the amendment was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13429)|
| 3:43:56| That's for the reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13436)|
| 3:43:57| It's just a request to look more into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13437)|
| 3:44:04| Would you respond to that, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13444)|
| 3:44:07| I don't have any problem with the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13447)|
| 3:44:10| There is not a built-up demand for development anywhere in Knox County right at the present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13450)|
| 3:44:17| so we're not being swamped by potential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13457)|
| 3:44:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13463)|
| 3:44:24| Have you been contacted by the Chamber or in reference to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13464)|
| 3:44:30| in reference to these items that are on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13470)|
| 3:44:35| I have received no comment or contact from the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13475)|
| 3:44:40| At our public meeting, public hearing at the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13480)|
| 3:44:44| there was objections to us initiating these contrary to the Briggs Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13484)|
| 3:44:52| of the Hillside and Ridge Top Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13492)|
| 3:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13495)|
| 3:44:56| And that's to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13496)|
| 3:44:58| The same question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13498)|
| 3:45:01| Have we been contacted by the Chamber in reference to either of these items that are on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13501)|
| 3:45:09| If I might, yes, we received an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13509)|
| 3:45:15| I think it was from Mr. Edwards instructing us as a law department to instruct Mr. Donaldson to forthwith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13515)|
| 3:45:25| cease doing anything with regard to the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13525)|
| 3:45:30| and the development of them which you have before you on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13530)|
| 3:45:34| The response, I drafted it, Mr. Jarrett didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13534)|
| 3:45:37| He was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13537)|
| 3:45:39| The response was that we had no authority to tell Mr. Donaldson what he could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13539)|
| 3:45:44| and couldn't do in exercising his statutory authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13544)|
| 3:45:50| Statutory authority, as Mr. Donaldson is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13550)|
| 3:45:53| lies 100% on subdivision regulations with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13553)|
| 3:46:00| The technicality he raises is one that perhaps should be cleared up down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13560)|
| 3:46:05| But the bottom line is that the Planning Commission has sole authority to promulgate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13565)|
| 3:46:12| and pass after public hearing subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13572)|
| 3:46:15| So, in my mind, when they did that, those subdivision regulations became legally proper under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13575)|
| 3:46:25| And, as he said, it's a technicality because we have somewhere down the line incorporated those in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13585)|
| 3:46:32| So that's on the subdivision issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13592)|
| 3:46:34| The other issue is the rezoning consistent with the Hilltop Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13594)|
| 3:46:41| which I believe that Mr. Wise, the attorney for MPC and Mr. Donaldson have said, well, it's advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13601)|
| 3:46:50| And, you know, when we make these supposed zoning changes, and Mr. Donaldson can correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13610)|
| 3:46:57| we use that as an advisory document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13617)|
| 3:47:01| I think that's the position that Mr. Wise indicated to me, and Mr. Donaldson can correct that if it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13621)|
| 3:47:08| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13628)|
| 3:47:09| Quite often, the MPC staff is in the position to initiate recommendations that lie within plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13629)|
| 3:47:16| Oftentimes, we rely on the legislative body to ask us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13636)|
| 3:47:22| As we went through the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan, there were a number of items within the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13642)|
| 3:47:28| recommendations within the plan that even the opposition to the plan agreed were great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13648)|
| 3:47:33| These are two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13653)|
| 3:47:37| So we took the step to initiate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13657)|
| 3:47:42| They will reduce the impact of development within the steep slopes and ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13662)|
| 3:47:47| as well as saving developers money within development that lies within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13667)|
| 3:47:56| But the plans are full of really good ideas, and to say that we can't initiate ideas that lie within plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13676)|
| 3:48:08| because of what is known as the Briggs Amendment seems to be a little foolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13688)|
| 3:48:13| There were any number of ideas that even the opposition to the hillside and ridgetop plan agreed were good ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13693)|
| 3:48:23| and I would hate to see them stranded within the plan and not being able to be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13703)|
| 3:48:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13711)|
| 3:48:32| That's all the questions that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13712)|
| 3:48:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13713)|
| 3:48:34| Thanks, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13714)|
| 3:48:35| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13715)|
| 3:48:37| I'd just like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13717)|
| 3:48:41| And I agree with you that there were a lot of good ideas in the hillsides and ridgetop plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13721)|
| 3:48:48| and that's why we adopted the plan and didn't reject it out and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13728)|
| 3:48:51| If we thought everything in there was bad or most of it was bad, we should have just thrown it out and not even done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13731)|
| 3:48:56| But I think there was a lot of us that did not feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13736)|
| 3:48:59| What the purpose was of adding that additional amendment of making it non-binding and advisory was just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13739)|
| 3:49:09| So if people came with good ideas, that even though it didn't fit the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13749)|
| 3:49:15| they would have the opportunity to bring that before this body to let this be judged, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13755)|
| 3:49:22| on the merits of the plan and not the merits of a document, which was the hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13762)|
| 3:49:28| The thing that concerns me when we start codifying this into ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13768)|
| 3:49:35| even though the contention is that this was taken from a good idea of the hillside plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13775)|
| 3:49:41| and putting it into an ordinance, we're removing it from being non-binding and advisory to now where it's code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13781)|
| 3:49:48| and we don't have the opportunity to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13788)|
| 3:49:51| And either developers or citizens don't have the opportunity to either to object to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13791)|
| 3:49:59| or make their case that this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13799)|
| 3:50:03| And what I think the intention was of making it non-binding and advisory is to give people the opportunity to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13803)|
| 3:50:13| and present this to us and allow us to see if this is a good idea or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13813)|
| 3:50:17| rather than codifying it to where it can be rejected just on the basis of the rigidity of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13817)|
| 3:50:28| Any other questions for Mr. Donaldson, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13828)|
| 3:50:33| If not, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13833)|
| 3:50:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13834)|
| 3:50:36| One final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13836)|
| 3:50:39| I made a pledge to you that I would step aside as your chair at the end of two years, and I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13839)|
| 3:50:45| And so next month will be my last meeting as your chair with you fine folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13845)|
| 3:50:48| I will be sending you out an e-mail outlining the duties and responsibilities of this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13848)|
| 3:50:54| because you're going to be thinking about new leadership in 30 or 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13854)|
| 3:50:59| So I will do that because there's a lot involved in the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13859)|
| 3:51:03| and I want to make sure that everyone is thoroughly up to speed on exactly what the duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13863)|
| 3:51:08| and responsibilities are of the commission chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13868)|
| 3:51:12| Has there been a determination yet on because the 30th comes in on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13872)|
| 3:51:18| Yes, we have set a meeting date for after Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13878)|
| 3:51:21| The morning of the 4th at 830?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=13881)|

| 3:53:33| Our first item on zoning, Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| 6-A-12-RC is request of Samuel J. Furl for rezoning from CA General Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14015)|
| 3:53:42| to OB Office of Medical and Related Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14022)|
| 3:53:45| This property is located northeast side of Thunder Lane, northwest of East Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14025)|

| 3:54:21| Good luck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14061)|
| 3:54:22| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14062)|
| 3:54:23| Zoning Appeals 4-H-12-RC is appeal by Choteau Partners of MPC's denial of rezoning from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14063)|
| 3:54:30| RA Low Density Residential to OB Office of Medical and Related Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14070)|
| 3:54:36| Property located northwest side of Plum Creek Drive, southeast of Parkside Drive in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14076)|
| 3:54:43| 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14083)|
| 3:54:44| The applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14084)|
| 3:54:45| I know we have opposition here, so could we hear first from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14085)|
| 3:54:49| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14089)|
| 3:54:50| This is an appeal of a request for rezoning for property that's located on the northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14090)|
| 3:54:57| side of Plum Creek Drive, southeast of Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14097)|
| 3:55:01| Rezoning request is from RA Low Density Residential to OB Office of Medical and Related Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14101)|
| 3:55:08| The property, the rezoning involves approximately two and a half acres over two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14108)|
| 3:55:16| This also was considered by MPC along with a plan amendment that would have allowed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14116)|
| 3:55:23| office development, and that plan amendment was for an office sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14123)|
| 3:55:29| from Low Density Residential sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14129)|
| 3:55:35| The plan amendment and the rezoning obviously were recommended for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14135)|
| 3:55:41| The action of the planning commission was to deny the sector plan amendment and to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14141)|
| 3:55:47| denial of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14147)|
| 3:55:50| This is a case where you have the rezoning before you at this particular step based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14150)|
| 3:55:56| state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14156)|
| 3:55:57| The sector plan amendment cannot come forward at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14157)|
| 3:56:02| However, you do have the option if you seem to be wanting to hear and wanting to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14162)|
| 3:56:09| that flexibility to consider the rezoning and the sector plan at the same time, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14169)|
| 3:56:14| have that option of initiating a rezoning request to office that would allow consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14174)|
| 3:56:20| of the OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14180)|
| 3:56:22| And they would both come back here to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14182)|
| 3:56:24| They would have to go back to MPC for consideration of both, and then they would have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14184)|
| 3:56:29| back to this body roughly in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14189)|
| 3:56:33| So it's kind of a circuitous process, but the way state law is written, we can only consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14193)|
| 3:56:40| the rezoning appeal today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14200)|
| 3:56:42| But if you have any inclination of favoring or looking at both the rezoning with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14202)|
| 3:56:47| amendment, you can initiate your plan amendment request today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14207)|
| 3:56:51| Having said all that, the rezoning, as I say, involves property on Plum Creek, southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14211)|
| 3:56:58| of Parkside Drive, two and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14218)|
| 3:57:01| And looking at this, the planning commission noted several things that really brought concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14221)|
| 3:57:07| to them in terms of rezoning this property for office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14227)|
| 3:57:11| If you look at it, you have two maps in your packet, the rezoning map and then opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14231)|
| 3:57:19| that a map of a plaid of what was Boxwood Hill subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14239)|
| 3:57:25| You can clearly see this property is oriented to that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14245)|
| 3:57:29| In fact, this is part of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14249)|
| 3:57:32| And at one time it was considered to be their recreation amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14252)|
| 3:57:38| It could be developed with swimming pool or some other type of recreation amenity for the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14258)|
| 3:57:44| So you can clearly see, especially by the zoning map, that this is part of a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14264)|
| 3:57:50| It's facing the subdivision, facing the properties on the southeast side of Plum Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14270)|
| 3:57:56| And as we say, it's clearly part of a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14276)|
| 3:58:02| Any access to the property as it stands now would be by residential, local residential street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14282)|
| 3:58:09| Properties to the southwest that are developed with office and commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14289)|
| 3:58:17| but that's a developed node around the intersection of Parkside and Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14297)|
| 3:58:22| They also have adequate access by means of Deerbrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14302)|
| 3:58:28| The property is situated such that it is south of a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14308)|
| 3:58:32| In fact, part of the plan amendment would also look at stream protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14312)|
| 3:58:38| the stream protection areas it shows on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14318)|
| 3:58:42| That is a natural boundary line between all of the commercial and non-residential uses that you see on Parkside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14322)|
| 3:58:50| and then southeast of that, the residential use on Plum Creek Drive, Diane Drive, Debbie Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14330)|
| 3:58:57| and all the residential streets in Boxwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14337)|
| 3:59:01| So the staff, in looking at all of this information, recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14341)|
| 3:59:07| The Planning Commission supported the staff recommendation unanimously, 13-0, again to deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14347)|
| 3:59:16| And that, of course, was based on the recommendation of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14356)|
| 3:59:22| and the decision of the commission to deny the sector plan amendment to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14362)|
| 3:59:29| If you would, the commission is familiar with when you mention a residential land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14369)|
| 3:59:34| but if you look at your proposed use on the documentation provided, it says any use permitted in the OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14374)|
| 3:59:40| Give the commission an idea of what precisely can go in an OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14380)|
| 3:59:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14385)|
| 4:00:08| We're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14408)|
| 4:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14428)|
| 4:00:29| The OB zone, Office of Medical and Related Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14429)|
| 4:00:33| The very first use is any use permitted and is regulated in general residential zone, which is the RB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14433)|
| 4:00:41| It allows consideration of those kinds of uses under OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14441)|
| 4:00:45| The general residential zone is predominantly a multifamily, medium-density type residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14445)|
| 4:00:51| Other uses, professional and business offices, hospitals, clinics, medical and dental offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14451)|
| 4:00:57| undertaking establishments and funeral homes, hotels, motels, private clubs and lodges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14457)|
| 4:01:02| art galleries and museums, business colleges, public and private schools, commercial parking lots, recreational uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14462)|
| 4:01:11| And then uses permitted on review would be child care centers, assisted living facilities, commercial cell towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14471)|
| 4:01:18| adult daycare centers, methadone treatment clinics and pain management clinics as uses permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14478)|
| 4:01:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14485)|
| 4:01:28| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14488)|
| 4:01:32| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14492)|
| 4:01:41| First, I'd like to express appreciation to this body for postponing this from your last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14501)|
| 4:01:48| I've had some health issues and health problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14508)|
| 4:01:51| and I'm not really able to be here at that time and I appreciate that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14511)|
| 4:01:57| By way of background on this, I was having those medical problems at the time this matter came before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14517)|
| 4:02:05| the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14525)|
| 4:02:07| I was not able to attend there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14527)|
| 4:02:10| One of my partners went to that meeting and requested a postponement, did not get a motion to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14530)|
| 4:02:19| and there was no discussion of this matter on its merits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14539)|
| 4:02:24| failing to get a motion to have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14544)|
| 4:02:27| One of the members of the MPC made a motion to deny and it was voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14547)|
| 4:02:33| and there was really no discussion of the merits of the request for the change in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14553)|
| 4:02:41| And I'm here today in essence to ask for the opportunity for other utilization of this property to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14561)|
| 4:02:51| And the way that has to happen, and that's one of the reasons I wanted to be here as opposed to send somebody else down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14571)|
| 4:02:58| it's a little bit of an unusual situation where we have to have a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14578)|
| 4:03:04| and that plan amendment is denied by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14584)|
| 4:03:12| A lot of litigation in the past over that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14592)|
| 4:03:15| but the ultimate result is this body can initiate or the request for that amendment to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14595)|
| 4:03:29| And what you have to do is, in essence, vote to refer this to MPC for consideration of amendment to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14609)|
| 4:03:42| And I guess you vote on that in favor and then it goes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14622)|
| 4:03:48| I'm told by Mr. Donaldson and Buzz that, in essence, the rezoning request goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14628)|
| 4:04:00| Then ultimately it comes back to you all, but standing as it is, you can't simply reverse, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14640)|
| 4:04:11| and go ahead today and vote to rezone pursuant to my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14651)|
| 4:04:18| I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14658)|
| 4:04:20| Is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14660)|
| 4:04:21| Tell me if I'm wrong because this is sort of a little bit of a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14661)|
| 4:04:27| The reason we asked for O.B. is taking a look at this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14667)|
| 4:04:32| It is sitting on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14672)|
| 4:04:36| It's across the street from Grayson Pontiac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14676)|
| 4:04:40| Just to the east of it on the other side is the goodies location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14680)|
| 4:04:44| To the west of us is a strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14684)|
| 4:04:46| There's an office right across Glade Street from an office facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14686)|
| 4:04:52| Beyond that is a strip center with an insurance agency, cleaners, a check cashing place, and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14692)|
| 4:05:03| And then you have Wasabi and the intersection of Lovell and Parkside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14703)|
| 4:05:12| On that deer brook, which is, again, across the street and to the west across Glade from where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14712)|
| 4:05:24| there's a self-storage development, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14724)|
| 4:05:28| All around that area, if you look at the zoning, you have a lot of it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14728)|
| 4:05:32| This is in the county, but a lot of it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14732)|
| 4:05:34| It's C3, C4, C6, all sorts of commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14734)|
| 4:05:40| This piece of property, situated as it is, is not going to develop residentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14740)|
| 4:05:47| If you had a residential utilization proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14747)|
| 4:05:51| it would be at a density that I'm sure that neighborhood would likewise oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14751)|
| 4:05:58| So our thought was we need something between an outright commercial utilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14758)|
| 4:06:04| and the residential that's on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14764)|
| 4:06:08| And that's what we came with was O.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14768)|
| 4:06:11| O.B. gives us the widest, if you will, choice in an office zoning category of potential utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14771)|
| 4:06:21| Staff had suggested if you were going to consider something, you would look at O.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14781)|
| 4:06:25| If you did O.A. instead of O.B., you would eliminate, for example, a hospital, a funeral home, a hotel or motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14785)|
| 4:06:33| an assisted living facility or a bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14793)|
| 4:06:37| Frankly, if we look at it, looking at it just on paper and knowing the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14797)|
| 4:06:45| something such as a small hotel, motel, perhaps an assisted living or a bank are pretty good potential utilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14805)|
| 4:06:57| of that property other than just standard office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14817)|
| 4:07:01| I don't think there's that much demand just for professional offices, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14821)|
| 4:07:07| which is the major thing that's permitted in the O.A. zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14827)|
| 4:07:14| The idea that the lot was designated for subdivision use is not really accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14834)|
| 4:07:25| There hasn't been a swimming pool or such a facility at that location in a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14845)|
| 4:07:32| At one time when there was one there, it was not restricted to that subdivision use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14852)|
| 4:07:39| In fact, it was a public pool where people paid to go swim there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14859)|
| 4:07:45| There's nothing by deed or otherwise that restricts the utilization of this property to a supposed recreational use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14865)|
| 4:07:55| or a use for utilization only by that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14875)|
| 4:08:03| We would ask that this body send the matter back to MPC with a request for an amendment to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14883)|
| 4:08:15| which would then allow consideration of the O.B. zoning classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14895)|
| 4:08:21| and, like I say, ultimately be back in front of this body with a discussion of O.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14901)|
| 4:08:29| and or perhaps something else if this body didn't want to do O.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14909)|
| 4:08:36| That's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14916)|
| 4:08:38| I'll leave it to Buzz or Mr. Donaldson or perhaps Mr. Jarrett to say exactly what the nature of the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14918)|
| 4:08:46| But as I understand it, if you simply move to have MPC reconsider its action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14926)|
| 4:08:56| and take up the proposed amendment to the sector plan to permit O.B. zoning, I believe that would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14936)|
| 4:09:08| Am I right or wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14948)|
| 4:09:12| One other option would be to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14952)|
| 4:09:17| If that is not your choice, you have the opportunity to initiate a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14957)|
| 4:09:25| and to ask MPC to reconsider the zoning in conjunction with that initiated plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14965)|
| 4:09:32| And then it would go to MPC for a recommendation and come back to you for final action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14972)|
| 4:09:39| We have a number of people here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14979)|
| 4:09:41| We did hear from some of you at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14981)|
| 4:09:44| Would anyone like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14984)|
| 4:09:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14986)|
| 4:09:47| If you would give us your name and address for the record, please, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14987)|
| 4:09:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14990)|
| 4:09:51| I am Sam Alexander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14991)|
| 4:09:52| I live at 10724 Plum Creek Drive, which is in this subdivision, Boxwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=14992)|
| 4:10:02| And I want to say that I think Mr. Lewis's comments were sort of a mischaracterization of how nice this subdivision is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15002)|
| 4:10:12| just based on the people that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15012)|
| 4:10:15| Boxwood Hills is a small 60-home, roughly, subdivision that is surrounded by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15015)|
| 4:10:27| literally on three sides and residential on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15027)|
| 4:10:32| It has some very natural barriers that keep it in place and make it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15032)|
| 4:10:44| There are some very well-established legal boundaries with easements on the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15044)|
| 4:10:52| and south sides of the subdivision separating the subdivision and residences from business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15052)|
| 4:10:57| In fact, the creation of some of these boundaries included the closings of two entrances to the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15057)|
| 4:11:05| one from the south at Plum Creek Drive to Kingston Pike and one from the north at Wakefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15065)|
| 4:11:11| and Parkside Drive, leaving only two remaining entrances at Wakefield on the south and Glade Drive on the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15071)|
| 4:11:21| The closing of the Wakefield entrance from Parkside Drive helped shore up one of the natural boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15081)|
| 4:11:27| between the businesses and the residents on the north side, creating a buffer along the protected waterway of Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15087)|
| 4:11:36| which is the city and county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15096)|
| 4:11:39| The property at issue is inside that natural and legal parameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15099)|
| 4:11:45| The Boxwood Hills subdivision and the request to rezone is an invasion on the lives and properties of its residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15105)|
| 4:11:55| We believe part of the invasion, Choateau Properties, has already violated the law by removing the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15115)|
| 4:12:01| and vegetation along the protected waterway of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15121)|
| 4:12:05| The clear cutting and removal of the trees also removed the noise and bright light buffer that protected our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15125)|
| 4:12:13| from the businesses and traffic on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15133)|
| 4:12:17| Choateau's self-serving removal of the trees from the protected area to make their for sale sign more visible is an act of disrespect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15137)|
| 4:12:25| not only to the residents but to this commission by their violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15145)|
| 4:12:30| Access to the property would be from Plum Creek Drive through one of the two remaining entrances, Wakefield and Glade Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15150)|
| 4:12:39| Increased traffic through the subdivision where there are no sidewalks, where children play and adults walk on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15159)|
| 4:12:48| would create a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15168)|
| 4:12:51| In fact, there's one couple that lives directly across from the property that have three small children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15171)|
| 4:12:59| and another couple with four children that live directly adjacent to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15179)|
| 4:13:06| The residents of Boxwood Hills have worked hard to curb speeders that use our neighborhood to cut through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15186)|
| 4:13:14| as a shortcut between Kingston Pike and Parkside Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15194)|
| 4:13:18| by having the county install speed humps and traffic calming intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15198)|
| 4:13:23| The increased traffic that would be created by the rezoning of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15203)|
| 4:13:28| and by putting business inside that perimeter would negate those calming measures and create a public safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15208)|
| 4:13:36| We believe MPC understood the issues and made the right decision by denying Choateau Partners' request to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15216)|
| 4:13:46| Speaking on behalf of the neighbors of Boxwood Hills, I would certainly request that the commission deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15226)|
| 4:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15234)|
| 4:13:56| And I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15236)|
| 4:14:02| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15242)|
| 4:14:04| Does anyone else wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15244)|
| 4:14:06| The way we're going to do this is we want to give you an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15246)|
| 4:14:09| Mr. King is also going to get an opportunity to kind of rebut, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15249)|
| 4:14:14| just so everybody gets their fair and equal amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15254)|
| 4:14:17| Certainly, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15257)|
| 4:14:18| Would anyone else like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15258)|
| 4:14:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15262)|
| 4:14:24| I'm not going to be as bold as I kind of normally am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15264)|
| 4:14:26| I've been 15 miles before I came here, but Michelle Biddick-Simmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15266)|
| 4:14:31| I live at 232 Pat Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15271)|
| 4:14:33| And first of all, I'm glad you're doing better, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15273)|
| 4:14:36| Two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15276)|
| 4:14:37| One, in a professional situation, if you have a partner, particularly in a legal establishment or firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15277)|
| 4:14:45| everybody's supposed to have been kept up with what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15285)|
| 4:14:49| Just like in a medical thing, you sit down, you discuss things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15289)|
| 4:14:52| So if the ball is dropped because someone, unfortunately, was ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15292)|
| 4:14:55| that should have been easily picked up and taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15295)|
| 4:14:58| That's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15298)|
| 4:14:59| So I'm very sorry he was not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15299)|
| 4:15:02| However, his partner in the business should have been able to take care of things at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15302)|
| 4:15:06| and we should have not been dealing with this right now being brought up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15306)|
| 4:15:10| Second, yeah, we have a little stream right there, and it's actually part of the watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15310)|
| 4:15:17| The trees were cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15317)|
| 4:15:18| Our neighborhood's exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15318)|
| 4:15:19| However, we are still a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15319)|
| 4:15:21| And the little tiny road right there, Glade, is this big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15321)|
| 4:15:24| Anybody that's been through our neighborhood knows how tiny it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15324)|
| 4:15:27| And if you've been there at certain times of the day, you know how much traffic we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15327)|
| 4:15:32| So the very thought that this may go beyond just you all and the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15332)|
| 4:15:39| and try to change a state law or something written down in the state rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15339)|
| 4:15:47| opens up such a can of worms not just for our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15347)|
| 4:15:51| but is this going to happen every time someone wants to get a toehold in somebody else's neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15351)|
| 4:15:58| that this is already on the books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15358)|
| 4:16:00| Well, it happened in Boxwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15360)|
| 4:16:02| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15362)|
| 4:16:04| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15364)|
| 4:16:05| And there are other little neighborhoods that have that same stream that go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15365)|
| 4:16:10| and they're older and more established than our neighborhood, and they're right up from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15370)|
| 4:16:14| And there are property pieces that I think have been rezoned city that are on the edges of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15374)|
| 4:16:19| and I know people that live in those neighborhoods who have been having the worst time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15379)|
| 4:16:23| since those areas were bulldozed and have never sold again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15383)|
| 4:16:28| So there are so many pieces of property along Parkside, which, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15388)|
| 4:16:32| Truckers Lane is named Parkside because of that piece of property that we're talking about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15392)|
| 4:16:38| because people used to always drive through and say, look at that pretty park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15398)|
| 4:16:42| They didn't know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15402)|
| 4:16:43| They just saw a pool, and they saw a well-maintained area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15403)|
| 4:16:47| Look at that pretty park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15407)|
| 4:16:48| So when they started doing names, Parkside came up, not Buildingside, not anything other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15408)|
| 4:16:56| If we have three little houses or two houses, the last time the property sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15416)|
| 4:17:01| I believe it was actually for $299,000, $1 off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15421)|
| 4:17:05| It was an auction from what we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15425)|
| 4:17:07| You could actually put houses there on a piece of property that could sell for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15427)|
| 4:17:11| Our neighborhood can maintain having larger houses that are more expensive than what we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15431)|
| 4:17:18| We have people moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15438)|
| 4:17:19| All of us have been redoing our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15439)|
| 4:17:21| This is a viable community that the minute you put something in there like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15441)|
| 4:17:26| someone else is going to think, oh, you know, I could buy the houses next door to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15446)|
| 4:17:30| because it's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15450)|
| 4:17:31| All I have to do is cut the trees down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15451)|
| 4:17:33| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15453)|
| 4:17:35| And then we can use Glade, and we can drive in there, and that's going to kill a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15455)|
| 4:17:39| And, unfortunately, now, I was raised in Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15459)|
| 4:17:42| I'm an American citizen, but I was raised in Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15462)|
| 4:17:44| And in Europe, I could walk everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15464)|
| 4:17:47| I could get out even in the large cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15467)|
| 4:17:49| I don't find that places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15469)|
| 4:17:50| We moved down from D.C. and even from Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15470)|
| 4:17:53| And in some areas of Asheville, we're having this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15473)|
| 4:17:55| And we've been here almost 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15475)|
| 4:17:57| We bought our house after grad school, moved in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15477)|
| 4:18:00| I don't want to see this lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15480)|
| 4:18:02| I don't want to see every time I drive up Parkside, more of the trees gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15482)|
| 4:18:07| and more buildings in there that someone wanted to put in for a medical facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15487)|
| 4:18:10| when we also have medical facilities right up the road in Turkey Creek that are not even filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15490)|
| 4:18:15| We have so many buildings that are not filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15495)|
| 4:18:18| So let's maintain neighborhood and keep that boundary secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15498)|
| 4:18:22| We've already talked to some people about getting some of the trees back in, the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15502)|
| 4:18:27| We're going to talk to the stormwater people, because as far as we know, no remediation plan has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15507)|
| 4:18:33| They've stopped finally doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15513)|
| 4:18:35| Whenever they'd have it mowed, someone would come in and weed-whack all the trees on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15515)|
| 4:18:39| which was actually in violation again, because I had spoken with the man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15519)|
| 4:18:43| I don't remember his name right now, unfortunately, because I don't have my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15523)|
| 4:18:46| But the man who's in charge, it's federal and state for trying to keep the stormwater area safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15526)|
| 4:18:51| And he had actually said, just leave the stumps alone, Michelle, because they'll grow back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15531)|
| 4:18:56| Well, I can't go in and make him stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15536)|
| 4:18:58| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15538)|
| 4:18:59| I've spoken to him once, and I know Sam has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15539)|
| 4:19:01| And they've finally stopped doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| However, I don't know if you guys know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15543)|
| 4:19:06| I mean, you're the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15546)|
| 4:19:07| You do know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15547)|
| 4:19:08| You have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15548)|
| 4:19:09| The stormwater people have been giving out oaks to plant along the waterways in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15549)|
| 4:19:15| because we're cutting them down at such a rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15555)|
| 4:19:18| We're losing so much topsoil into the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15558)|
| 4:19:20| It's actually every time you have soil go into the water, it takes the oxygen out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15560)|
| 4:19:26| We need those trees back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15566)|
| 4:19:28| This is our watershed for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15568)|
| 4:19:30| And I'm county, but I actually care about the fact this is part of the watershed for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15570)|
| 4:19:34| We don't need a business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15574)|
| 4:19:36| We don't need a high-rise, luxury high-rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15576)|
| 4:19:39| We need several houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15579)|
| 4:19:41| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15581)|
| 4:19:42| We've already discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15582)|
| 4:19:43| We would actually be willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15583)|
| 4:19:45| I believe that the mandate is on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15585)|
| 4:19:47| Ma'am, your time is just about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15587)|
| 4:19:48| I believe in our neighborhood it's like you can have one house per the large lot, which is part of why all of us like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15588)|
| 4:19:52| We have very large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15592)|
| 4:19:55| But we would be willing if it were two houses per those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15595)|
| 4:19:58| That would be four houses right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15598)|
| 4:20:00| Or however many we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15600)|
| 4:20:02| I mean, no more than that, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15602)|
| 4:20:04| But we care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15604)|
| 4:20:06| We're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15606)|
| 4:20:07| We get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15607)|
| 4:20:08| We have weekly meetings at McAllister's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15608)|
| 4:20:10| They recognize us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15610)|
| 4:20:12| So we're vocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15612)|
| 4:20:15| And there are other neighborhoods that, by God, if they need my help, I'll go with them and help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15615)|
| 4:20:20| But please don't do this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15620)|
| 4:20:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15622)|
| 4:20:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15623)|
| 4:20:25| Mr. King, would you like the opportunity to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15625)|
| 4:20:39| Just a couple of quick points, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15639)|
| 4:20:41| If you look at your map at Plum Creek Drive, the houses that border north side of Plum Creek Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15641)|
| 4:20:51| to the north of those homes, in other words, adjoining them to their rear, is property that is zoned C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15651)|
| 4:21:01| It does not really make a whole lot of sense to continue with an office zoning classification further east at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15661)|
| 4:21:14| or along Plum Creek Drive, any further east than this piece of property, because this is really oriented to Glade and Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15674)|
| 4:21:26| In other words, I don't think the suggestion that, well, if this were to be rezoned, then all this other is going to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15686)|
| 4:21:37| and be subject to being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15697)|
| 4:21:41| I just don't see that being the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15701)|
| 4:21:47| I hear the comment, and I certainly don't live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15707)|
| 4:21:51| and I'm not frequently through that area enough to be able to dispute what is being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15711)|
| 4:22:02| But, again, if you look at it, Wakefield is closed at the north end of it, that where it runs into or did run into Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15722)|
| 4:22:16| None of the other streets in Boxwood appear to, and I think I'm hearing it right, don't really intersect Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15736)|
| 4:22:28| So what happens is to have cut-through traffic, you have somebody who has to come off of Kingston Pike on a Wakefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15748)|
| 4:22:36| and then wind their way around in this subdivision to get to Glade Drive to get to Parkside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15756)|
| 4:22:45| as opposed to simply continuing just a little bit further west on Kingston Pike and take a right on Lovell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15765)|
| 4:22:52| and run right into Parkside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15772)|
| 4:22:55| There may be some cut-through traffic there, but I don't think it is so substantial that you ought to, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15775)|
| 4:23:05| put this piece of property to its continued non-use as a consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15785)|
| 4:23:11| I would ask that the appeal be supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15791)|
| 4:23:19| I didn't give you that background out of a sense of my office not being prepared to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15799)|
| 4:23:30| I gave it to you as a framework for understanding why we are sort of where we are today and what's before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15810)|
| 4:23:41| And if you see fit to undertake consideration of a rezoning of this property so it can be put to beneficial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15821)|
| 4:23:50| the way you have to do it is as has been suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15830)|
| 4:23:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15834)|
| 4:23:55| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15835)|
| 4:23:57| Yes, just a few quick comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15837)|
| 4:23:59| I think the best argument made why we should deny the appeal was made by Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15839)|
| 4:24:06| You know, this was reviewed, this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15846)|
| 4:24:09| You don't really appreciate it from these sketch maps that we have right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15849)|
| 4:24:13| but if you look at Google Earth, if you drive over there, the property really is part of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15853)|
| 4:24:18| and that's why it was zoned low-density residential when they did this originally because that's what made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15858)|
| 4:24:24| It made sense for that to be part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15864)|
| 4:24:29| It really is unfortunate that those trees had to be cut down because it was an affront to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15869)|
| 4:24:37| and did show some disrespect for both the property, the watershed, and the whole area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15877)|
| 4:24:46| I'd like to make a motion to deny the appeal per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15886)|
| 4:24:54| It was unanimous vote by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15894)|
| 4:24:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15897)|
| 4:24:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15898)|
| 4:24:59| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15899)|
| 4:25:00| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15900)|
| 4:25:05| May I make one more comment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15905)|
| 4:25:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15907)|
| 4:25:08| Would all the folks that are from the neighborhood, would you please stand up just so the commission knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15908)|
| 4:25:12| this isn't just a couple of disgruntled residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15912)|
| 4:25:17| There's a lot of people that went to a lot of trouble to come down here tonight to let us know that they felt that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15917)|
| 4:25:24| wasn't appropriate for their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15924)|
| 4:25:25| Sometimes we see just one or two people who are always going to be the neighborhood complainers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15925)|
| 4:25:34| that are opposed to something, but this really has a lot of support in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15934)|
| 4:25:39| So the motion on the floor is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15939)|
| 4:25:42| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15942)|
| 4:25:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15944)|
| 4:25:46| I've spoken a couple of times this evening today about my staff and the staff car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15946)|
| 4:25:56| Please take that in the humorous vein that I offer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15956)|
| 4:26:03| But Sunday a week ago, I had listed up ten different places I'd like to drive by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15963)|
| 4:26:10| and actually it turned out to be 12 because in one of the newspapers right in front of our trip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15970)|
| 4:26:18| 7215 Middlebrook came up as a front page story with the school system owning 2.73 acres on Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15978)|
| 4:26:31| and it's just a house and trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15991)|
| 4:26:34| And we, Knox County, looking for best utilization of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=15994)|
| 4:26:41| I guess what I was going to say was that whenever that one comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16001)|
| 4:26:45| we'll have some thorny issues settle between us, the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16005)|
| 4:26:51| and whoever it was that's on the front page of the paper talking about it being surplus property of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16011)|
| 4:27:00| It's going to take me a minute to get there, okay, because I went by Bob Gray and Bob Kirby, a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16020)|
| 4:27:07| I then continued down Bob Gray looking for Mayberry Hood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16027)|
| 4:27:11| But don't look for that when you go look at this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16031)|
| 4:27:14| You've got to look on the right-hand side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16034)|
| 4:27:16| The sign says Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16036)|
| 4:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16038)|
| 4:27:20| From there, Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16040)|
| 4:27:22| Well, heck, Outlet Drive is no longer an important street because the public market is going to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16042)|
| 4:27:30| But I did go to the other end of that particular road, and there's a lot of construction going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16050)|
| 4:27:35| It's really there by where the motorhomes are parked, and whatever that road is, it's going to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16055)|
| 4:27:42| People will just be able to slide right through there and across the interstate whenever it snows and goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16062)|
| 4:27:50| From there, I went to Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16070)|
| 4:27:53| I don't see anything happening at Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16073)|
| 4:27:56| Do you, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16076)|
| 4:27:59| Not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16079)|
| 4:28:04| It was a difficult drive to get from there to the far end of North Shore where we had a large discussion about a Wiggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16084)|
| 4:28:14| In fact, as you go down McPhee from the old stage road, and Pat said, what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16094)|
| 4:28:19| Excuse me, the staff said, what are we doing in Loudoun County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16099)|
| 4:28:22| And I said, I missed that road while you were asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16102)|
| 4:28:24| I've got to go back up here to the old stage road and turn right and go down McPhee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16104)|
| 4:28:28| and we went down through there about a mile, mile and a half, and out in the middle of nowhere, there's a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16108)|
| 4:28:34| Well, they liked it so well, you go about another mile, and there's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16114)|
| 4:28:41| But we do get to the end of North Shore at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16121)|
| 4:28:45| and an issue that we talked about, several meetings, humping the road, it's really a nice place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16125)|
| 4:28:55| That convenience center, I believe, I view to be an asset to what's happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16135)|
| 4:29:06| From there to another location that we had trouble with on Ebenezer, 1532 Ebenezer, right across the catty corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16146)|
| 4:29:16| from another convenience store right down the hill from Blue Grass Elementary, it's a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16156)|
| 4:29:27| We fussed about it for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16167)|
| 4:29:31| Today, that piece of property is on the county tax roll at $750,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16171)|
| 4:29:35| or maybe it sounds more impressive if I say three-quarters of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16175)|
| 4:29:41| It's generating $7,164 in taxes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16181)|
| 4:29:47| From there, I went to another place we had a lot of discussion about, 1104 Fox Road, Fox Road Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16187)|
| 4:29:57| Although it looks like three acres is sold, I don't know what's happening there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16197)|
| 4:30:02| but that piece of property is on the tax roll right now less than $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16202)|
| 4:30:14| Up the road, I guess I figured out how to come just right out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16214)|
| 4:30:21| buy this piece of property that we're talking about right now, across from the BMW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16221)|
| 4:30:27| Oh, I know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16227)|
| 4:30:28| Now, we followed Canton Hollow Road up through there and across Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16228)|
| 4:30:34| We're at this particular place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16234)|
| 4:30:40| We drove through the Trucker's Lane widening, and I may have one other place that we drove by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16240)|
| 4:30:48| You see, I traveled by lots of places that we've discussed at length about what's the best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16248)|
| 4:30:59| Not discounting now citizens of Knox County being here today because they have an interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16259)|
| 4:31:08| Whenever I looked at the particular drawings first saying it was residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16268)|
| 4:31:14| and then hearing it's been a commercial pool at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16274)|
| 4:31:17| or hearing that MPC turned it down, it wasn't even discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16277)|
| 4:31:24| or is this an attempt to get a towhold at Midway Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16284)|
| 4:31:30| I mean, not Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16290)|
| 4:31:31| We're trying to get a towhold at the corner of Parkside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16291)|
| 4:31:36| I say that tongue-in-cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16296)|
| 4:31:42| I believe we've still got room to say there needs to be some discussion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16302)|
| 4:31:48| and would amend the motion that's on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16308)|
| 4:31:51| or substitute motion that's on the floor to return this to the MPC folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16311)|
| 4:31:59| Substitute motion on the floor is to return to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16319)|
| 4:32:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16321)|
| 4:32:05| Motion has been made and seconded on the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16325)|
| 4:32:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16329)|
| 4:32:10| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16330)|
| 4:32:11| Let's talk about the ramifications of that, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16331)|
| 4:32:16| To send it back to the MPC, you have to initiate your own plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16336)|
| 4:32:22| So part of that motion would have to be to initiate an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16342)|
| 4:32:27| to revise the plan from low-density residential to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16347)|
| 4:32:32| and provide us some findings, a reason for making that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16352)|
| 4:32:40| And then in doing that, you could also refer the zoning case back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16360)|
| 4:32:46| in conjunction with the initiated plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16366)|
| 4:32:50| What he's saying is, in other words, it's not a rehearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16370)|
| 4:32:53| You then will become the initiator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16373)|
| 4:32:55| You will then have to give justification why you think this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16375)|
| 4:32:59| is no longer suitable to be merely residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16379)|
| 4:33:02| but why you feel it should now be the land you should be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16382)|
| 4:33:06| to permit the various and sundry things they mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16386)|
| 4:33:10| at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16390)|
| 4:33:13| You will be the applicant, essentially, and you will have to justify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16393)|
| 4:33:16| You merely just can't say, we think it should be office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16396)|
| 4:33:20| You'd have to say why you feel the current land use is inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16400)|
| 4:33:23| and why it should sustain one of the things that they mentioned early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16403)|
| 4:33:29| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16409)|
| 4:33:30| I'd just like to make a comment because a lot of the places that we've talked about before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16410)|
| 4:33:35| where we did, for instance, Choteau, Ebenezer, the lakeside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16415)|
| 4:33:40| some of those properties that we did convert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16420)|
| 4:33:43| the decision shouldn't be made on we're going to get something on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16423)|
| 4:33:48| at the expense of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16428)|
| 4:33:50| What the decision should be based on is not this economic thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16430)|
| 4:33:54| Is this the proper place to put this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16434)|
| 4:33:56| Is this in the interest of the county and the people that live here to place this here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16436)|
| 4:34:02| It's for that reason that I think it should be denied and we should vote to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16442)|
| 4:34:06| For instance, at Choteau that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16446)|
| 4:34:09| there were just as many people that lived in the area that wanted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16449)|
| 4:34:14| Actually, there were more people out there who wanted that than didn't want that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16454)|
| 4:34:17| and it was a unanimous decision by this body that we should put it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16457)|
| 4:34:21| and it was the recommendation of the NPC to put that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16461)|
| 4:34:24| It was the same thing about that piece of property at Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16464)|
| 4:34:28| Also, almost where that piece of property at Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16468)|
| 4:34:31| there's been a big discussion about a Weigel's, and you may have seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16471)|
| 4:34:36| well, you haven't seen that because they're not building it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16476)|
| 4:34:38| about what the sign should look like at the Weigel's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16478)|
| 4:34:41| but I know the NPC is really familiar with that, and there were some compromises made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16481)|
| 4:34:46| But I think this is a different case because we don't have the majority of people that live in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16486)|
| 4:34:51| like in Choteau, that said they want this there, that it's in addition to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16491)|
| 4:34:56| You mentioned that this was a commercial swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16496)|
| 4:34:59| It was a commercial swimming pool, maybe, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16499)|
| 4:35:01| I don't know what it really was, but it was certainly to the benefit of the neighborhood to have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16501)|
| 4:35:06| It was a place where the children could go play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16506)|
| 4:35:08| If you look at a Google Earth of this, and you really look what's around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16508)|
| 4:35:13| we're really putting a business in somebody's backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16513)|
| 4:35:17| And, I mean, in my opinion, it really is out of place for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16517)|
| 4:35:21| and I think that's why we have so many people that took the trouble to come down here last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16521)|
| 4:35:25| is that we are sticking a business where we're opening really a can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16525)|
| 4:35:29| This isn't just putting the potential for a medical office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16529)|
| 4:35:33| It's everything that Buzz mentioned that can go in there under that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16533)|
| 4:35:39| And it's for that reason that I think that the places that you mentioned, including Midway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16539)|
| 4:35:44| are very different than here because this affects a neighborhood and affects a large number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16544)|
| 4:35:50| And it was the NPC's recommendation to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16550)|
| 4:35:53| We're not going against NPC on doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16553)|
| 4:35:59| And it's for that reason I think we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16559)|
| 4:36:02| I think that motion needs to be defeated and then let us vote on the initial motion that was put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16562)|
| 4:36:09| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16569)|
| 4:36:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16571)|
| 4:36:12| I think I've been we're talking about how the motion should be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16572)|
| 4:36:18| We just can't send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16578)|
| 4:36:21| I believe that as we look at things, this is a proper place for something like this to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16581)|
| 4:36:30| because there are business locations on at least two sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16590)|
| 4:36:37| And it's not in the backyard of someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16597)|
| 4:36:42| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16602)|
| 4:36:43| It's in their front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16603)|
| 4:36:44| It's in the front yard of someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16604)|
| 4:36:49| And there are lots of things, I guess, that we don't have before us to discuss about entrance and exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16609)|
| 4:36:58| I have driven through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16618)|
| 4:37:01| I've gone through where all I drove through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16621)|
| 4:37:04| I've looked at trying to figure out this cross traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16624)|
| 4:37:08| and I've been there at the corner of Pat Road and whatever that was near the 232, the house number 232.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16628)|
| 4:37:19| So I've gone and looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16639)|
| 4:37:21| And the reason I've gone and looked is because I compare it to some of the other highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16641)|
| 4:37:26| and best and proper uses of real estate as we've allowed it to develop and look forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16646)|
| 4:37:34| Things will always be changing, and I say that in the context of Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16654)|
| 4:37:39| So I think commission has to keep its eyes open, its ears open, and sometimes make a difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16659)|
| 4:37:47| So my motion has to have something in it to satisfy going to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16667)|
| 4:37:53| I'll use that highest and best economic use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16673)|
| 4:37:59| So basically the motion on the floor is to uphold the appeal and to initiate a plan to send MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16679)|
| 4:38:06| Am I correcting that, Mr. Law Director, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16686)|
| 4:38:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16690)|
| 4:38:13| No, I want to make sure we're correct on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16693)|
| 4:38:15| That's why I want to make sure we get the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16695)|
| 4:38:17| Well, the motion was, Commissioner Wright's motion was, you know, the initial motion was to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16697)|
| 4:38:23| He did a substitute motion to send the matter back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16703)|
| 4:38:28| So what you'll be doing is initiating a plan amendment of your own to justify why the current land use isn't appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16708)|
| 4:38:37| and why it should be changed to a business land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16717)|
| 4:38:40| What would you like to add to that, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16720)|
| 4:38:42| And to reconsider the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16722)|
| 4:38:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16726)|
| 4:38:47| But to uphold the appeal would be to approve the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16727)|
| 4:38:51| You can't do that because the plan is not consistent with the zoning that's been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16731)|
| 4:38:58| So, Mr. Law Director, would you word the motion for us that Mr. Wright wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16738)|
| 4:39:02| I want to make sure we have the wording correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16742)|
| 4:39:05| I believe the motion is to initiate a plan amendment to change the land use as requested in the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16745)|
| 4:39:16| and along with that also to consider the land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16756)|
| 4:39:20| Does that sound logical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16760)|
| 4:39:25| And to reconsider the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16765)|
| 4:39:30| To initiate the plan amendment and to reconsider the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16770)|
| 4:39:34| And the practical effect is it would go from residential to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16774)|
| 4:39:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16780)|
| 4:39:41| Quick question of the neighborhood spokesman or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16781)|
| 4:39:45| How long has that lot been vacant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16785)|
| 4:39:48| Just approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16788)|
| 4:40:00| My name is David Keck and I live on Plum Creek just up from this lot in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16800)|
| 4:40:08| I moved there in 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16808)|
| 4:40:10| The subdivision was developed probably in 1968 and I lived close to it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16810)|
| 4:40:19| The man that developed the subdivision's name was A.C. Keller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16819)|
| 4:40:25| Now, he sold the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16825)|
| 4:40:28| He told the people, buy a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16828)|
| 4:40:31| He built a pool there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16831)|
| 4:40:33| You got a lifetime membership to the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16833)|
| 4:40:36| Now, that wasn't in the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16836)|
| 4:40:39| So, once Mr. Keller got the lot sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16839)|
| 4:40:45| then he started bringing buses from the boys club and the girls club to this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16845)|
| 4:40:53| and just turning these kids loose all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16853)|
| 4:40:56| Now, there weren't many houses in there at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16856)|
| 4:40:58| The lots were sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16858)|
| 4:40:59| There weren't many houses built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16859)|
| 4:41:01| One lady back here, I'm sure you all remember George Belisarius, a lot of you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16861)|
| 4:41:07| His wife was there at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16867)|
| 4:41:13| Because of that, the neighborhood got together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16873)|
| 4:41:17| Also, he moved a mobile home in beside his swimming pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16877)|
| 4:41:25| for the people operating the swimming pool to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16885)|
| 4:41:28| So, George got a petition up, had to move the mobile home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16888)|
| 4:41:32| As a result, Mr. Keller shut down the swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16892)|
| 4:41:36| Now, he always owned the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16896)|
| 4:41:39| It was a low-lying area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16899)|
| 4:41:42| With a lot of rain, it would flood and then drain off into the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16902)|
| 4:41:47| What year was the pool shut down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16907)|
| 4:41:50| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16910)|
| 4:41:51| 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16911)|
| 4:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16913)|
| 4:41:54| When the pool was shut down, was it filled in or was it completely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16914)|
| 4:41:57| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16917)|
| 4:41:58| No, the pool was still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16918)|
| 4:42:00| When you say shut down, shut down for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16920)|
| 4:42:03| Nobody could swim in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16923)|
| 4:42:05| Eddie Brennan bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16925)|
| 4:42:07| He's a gutter man there in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16927)|
| 4:42:09| Eddie was big into scuba diving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16929)|
| 4:42:13| He built the little A-frame kind of houses there beside where the pool was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16933)|
| 4:42:19| Eddie and his family lived in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16939)|
| 4:42:21| He used the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16941)|
| 4:42:23| He taught people how to scuba dive in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16943)|
| 4:42:26| It had a nice fence around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16946)|
| 4:42:28| It didn't belong to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16948)|
| 4:42:31| It never belonged to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16951)|
| 4:42:35| But I guess the best use for that property at that time would have been a wetlands area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16955)|
| 4:42:40| on the side next to the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16960)|
| 4:42:45| But now, Eddie sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16965)|
| 4:42:49| I'm thinking Eddie's the one that sold it to Winston Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16969)|
| 4:42:54| Then they come along and they must have dumped 600 loads of dirt in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16974)|
| 4:42:59| I don't know what the permits are if you needed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16979)|
| 4:43:01| but today the ones of you that have been down there see that lot is probably six foot higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16981)|
| 4:43:08| than the rest of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16988)|
| 4:43:10| But the swimming pool is still sitting in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16990)|
| 4:43:12| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16992)|
| 4:43:14| When he started dumping the dirt, he filled the old swimming pool in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16994)|
| 4:43:18| So the swimming pool is still there, underground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=16998)|
| 4:43:21| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17001)|
| 4:43:23| If you could get the dirt off of it, it would probably be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17003)|
| 4:43:26| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17006)|
| 4:43:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17010)|
| 4:43:31| It wasn't hard to throw you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17011)|
| 4:43:33| He built the level of that lot up even with Parkside Drive, which it never was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17013)|
| 4:43:43| It's too high now to even use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17023)|
| 4:43:46| I don't know what anybody might want to build a house on top of that hill for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17026)|
| 4:43:51| But I feel like that he was probably in violation of something when he dumped all that dirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17031)|
| 4:43:56| because now when it rains, the whole street's flooded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17036)|
| 4:44:00| and the water will stand there for two or three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17040)|
| 4:44:04| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17044)|
| 4:44:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=17045)|
