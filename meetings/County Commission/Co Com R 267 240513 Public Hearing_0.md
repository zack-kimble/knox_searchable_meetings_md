| 0:01:31| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=94)|

| 0:01:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| We're going to open this meeting with public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| and we will follow that up with any discussion that our commissioners might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| We have one person today signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| Is Mr. Hayden Bradfield here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| If you'd state your name and county of residence, and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=122)|
| 0:02:13| My name is Hayden Bradfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| I am from Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Pull your mic down just a little bit, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Yeah, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Today I want to take this valuable opportunity to address an important issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| that has been bothersome to me for over ten years and counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| This is my very first time appearing before county leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| and although nervous, I feel this important step must be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| I am eager to bring awareness to a vital cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| and today I want to discuss fire and emergency services in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| First, I wish to explain my motivation as to why I'm here before county leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| I was born in Knoxville, and I was raised here most of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| I grew up having respect for first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| and their mission to protect the lives of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| I highly value our community heroes, and from a very young age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| I admired the men and women who endured the highly daunting, strenuous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| and often dangerous work to maintain peace and public safety in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| I'm a former advanced CMT myself, and at one point I was heavily involved in public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| I braved hazardous situations and long sleepless nights to respond to those in peril.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| I have a passion to advocate for our emergency service organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| I feel most ordinary civilians aren't aware of the many existing functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| and capabilities that our emergency service organizations provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| For example, many fire departments do not just handle fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| but also respond to a wide array of emergency situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| such as medical emergencies, motor vehicle collisions, and hazmat situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| In fact, medical emergency calls account for most of the call volumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| of fire departments who respond to these types of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Firefighters are often cross-trained as emergency medical technicians and paramedics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| and they can provide advanced levels of care during life-threatening medical emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| Paramedics who work on ambulances are often mistaken as just ambulance drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| but these professionals can deliver advanced life-saving care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| Sadly, most county governmental entities in Tennessee have adopted a laissez-faire approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| to fire and emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| Knox County, despite its wealth and population growth over time, is no exception to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| Instead of proactively enriching and promoting fire and emergency services in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| the county government has placed responsibility and burden on private entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| and concerned communities in the unincorporated parts of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| These private entities, some non-profit and others for-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| receive very little to no funding from the Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| A study was conducted by the University of Tennessee's County Technical Assistance Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| that indicated Knox County's approach to fire and emergency services is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| Reports show subscription-based services unfairly burden willing subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| In addition, keep in mind, consequences can be devastating to those who fail to subscribe to these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| I would like to know how Knox County leaders responded to this study, if at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Knox County's failure to provide resources and adequate funding to fire and emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| undermines the vitality of these much-needed services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| This is not only a great concern for public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| but shows a lack of respect for the public safety community, the cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| and the men and women who serve, protect, and place their own safety at risk for the welfare of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| The Knox County Mayor, Glenn Jacobs, is expected to present a $1 billion budget plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| I am proposing, at the very least, that county leaders take better care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| concern, and consideration of fire and emergency services within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| I ask that the County Commission and the Mayor evaluate fire and emergency services more closely and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| if not already done, to formally recognize and designate these services as essential at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| Please consider funding our fire and emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| I believe I'm finished reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Do you have any other comments you'd like to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| No, ma'am, not at this current moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| You bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| And you are appreciated, and I can assure you we are taking that very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| Thank you for coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| There is no one else that has signed up for public forum at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| I'll go ahead and open the floor to discussion by commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=402)|
| 0:06:55| I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| Are there any comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| I just wanted to put this out there for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| Chris, or Director Caldwell, could you let us know how will the projects and studies that identified in the comprehensive plan be addressed in this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=431)|
| 0:07:22| Thank you for your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| So, Director Snowden submits not only like a capital budget, a five-year capital plan each year, and also in his operating budget, he has monies related for, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=444)|
| 0:07:40| more for just repair and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| And so, anything that he submits, he puts in an order of importance, and we don't ever really mess with his order of importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=463)|
| 0:07:54| And if we make tweaks to it, we always sit down with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| to make sure that it's going to not impact him in a serious way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| So, anything dealing with the comprehensive plan that he put in here would have been at his choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| And I understand that, Director Snowden, you were asked to prioritize this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| Yes, ma'am. We work together with finance to prioritize some of the near term, most recent, and most important projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=494)|
| 0:08:23| In the first quarter of next year, we're going to be looking at some of the projects that we have identified in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| And we're going to be looking at some of the other projects that we've identified in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| Yes, ma'am. We worked together with finance to prioritize some of the, you know, the near-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=515)|
| 0:08:43| and mid-term projects. Obviously, long-term is a little further out, but yes, yes, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| we did have conversations like that. So, the future studies that we have identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| in the comprehensive plan, when they also identify additional projects, will we then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| reprioritize our list? We will. We do that every year, and oftentimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| you know, like this year, we had a project that moved out with Everett Road because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| you know, TDOT chose to, you know, look at I-40 as a corridor rather than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| spot-related. So, they took Watt Road out. So, there's really no need for us to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| that money. So, yeah, we do look at it, and sometimes it can be a little more dynamic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| than we'd like. Thank you, Director Snowden. Also, does this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| budget align with the Parks and Recs Master Plan? I saw on page 15 under the Expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| Summary by Fund, Park Improvements, it was proposed zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| You said page 15? Yes, sir. Under Expenditure Summary by Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=578)|
| 0:09:58| Ultimately, what is in there is Park Improvements was a way that in previous years before Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=598)|
| 0:10:07| Mack, there was only a few OR codes that he used. Now, he has broken that out into more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| OR codes. So, that's definitely not Park Improvements as would be like for his master plan. It would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| be more, this is more driven toward operations, and he breaks it out more. He can probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| say how he breaks out his operations. Sure. And, Director Mack, you've done a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| great job in identifying grants to address some of our Park Improvements, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| Yes, ma'am. So, and Mr. Cardwell's correct. We have taken the time to really break down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=637)|
| 0:10:46| our budget for more detail so we can see exactly where we're spending our funds. So, Park Improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| was kind of too large and too broad. We wanted to be very specific. So, we requested some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=654)|
| 0:11:02| things in this new capital budget that are Park Improvements, but they are very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| to the detailed line items in the budget. Okay. Thank you both very much. Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| Cardwell, I see that employees are getting a minimal pay increase, cost of living increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| but it doesn't start until January. Can you explain why that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| Yes. So, ultimately, we had a lot of what I would call fixed cost increases in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=686)|
| 0:11:34| budget that basically, lack of a better word, made up all the growth per se, right? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| so, we can go through those. The new ambulance contract was about $2.3 million. We had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=702)|
| 0:11:50| building improvement costs that are about $600,000. Increase in funding of UOP is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| $1.4 million. There was maybe, and we moved fire prevention from engineering to the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=716)|
| 0:12:08| fund. We fixed that with a transfer. But ultimately, in doing so, what was left was about $1.3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| million for employee compensation. And so, we made the determination that's about a 1%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=735)|
| 0:12:24| raise for county employees, which does include the sheriff's officer, so you're aware, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| about 1.3. It's 1.3 to 1.4. And so, we chose, in lieu of giving a 1% raise in July, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=749)|
| 0:12:37| wait and do a 2% raise in January. And ultimately, what that will allow us to do as we end this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| year is, if there's a way that we're performing better, then maybe we could move that raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| up to September or give maybe some one-time bonuses. And so, it gives us some more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| And plus, in our mind, a 2% raise in January, you will feel more than you would feel a 1%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=775)|
| 0:13:05| raise. Thank you. Do we have any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=785)|
| 0:13:16| I will state that I think Director Caldwell was very upfront with all of us talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| this was going to be a very flat budget. And in fact, I think it's amazing what you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=803)|
| 0:13:31| made happen with it, given the fact that we have really tried to cut back and be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| limiting than usual in many things that are occurring. So, that's much appreciated what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| you and your team have done toward this. Is there anything that you'd like to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| Yeah, I would say this, so anyone here or the public would know, while I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| you all not asking as many questions, it's important to note that you all asked me a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| ton of questions during this process. And we had one-on-one meetings to where you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| an unlimited amount with me and my staff, the branches of the staff, not me. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| I just get to stand up here and talk. And so, you all have asked a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| We provide a lot of information. I think that's important to know. I think if anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| would come to one of these hearings, they would say, it's a billion-dollar budget and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| we've had five questions. I think what needs to be said is the work that you all do on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| the back end helps us and helps you to understand the process. So, oftentimes, it's not seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| at a public hearing like this, but it's meeting Terry on Friday for breakfast and going over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:56| things or whatever. We all met, and so I don't want to leave anybody out. And so, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| that's important to know. And I would just want to say that because I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=902)|
| 0:15:09| And thank you for pointing that out. Your staff has spent hours and hours and hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| with all of us individually talking about this budget and hitting a whole lot of detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=914)|
| 0:15:23| in it. So, thank you for bringing that to light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a question for Knox County Schools' finance team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=930)|
| 0:15:44| Mr. McPherson, if you'd identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=944)|
| 0:16:00| Ron McPherson, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Thank you, Mr. McPherson. Through my years on commission, we've added a lot of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=963)|
| 0:16:12| to the Knox County system. I'm noticing that throughout the state that a lot of our other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| metropolitan areas are looking at when they open up a new school, because it's more geographically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=979)|
| 0:16:29| located, they're closing a school. We've never closed a school since I've been on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| and since 2015. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Since that time, I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| Do you have any plans this next year to close any Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| I've not heard that discussion occurring. I can tell you that we have had just over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1008)|
| 0:16:56| the last several years, we have built schools due to area growth. And then we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1016)|
| 0:17:06| at another one in the Farragut Solution with growth. Mill Creek was with growth. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| two, Lonsdale and Adrian Burnett, were essentially replacement schools due to the age and structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| of the facilities. That's not to say that the district would ever disregard something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1036)|
| 0:17:25| like that. I just think that the last several schools that we have built have been for reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1045)|
| 0:17:34| not necessarily to combine for efficiencies, although I don't think that would ever be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| off the table. But it's been for reasons where it's the age of the structure itself, or we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| simply just have to find more seats for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| Some areas where we have like three to five hundred children in a school, the efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| would be, if you're building a new school, obviously to just have those combined so your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| operating costs are much lower. But we don't seem to do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| Well, I think you raise a good point. I think those operating costs, there are some savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1090)|
| 0:18:18| that can be garnered. I will say that when a new school is built and maybe multiple schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1098)|
| 0:18:26| are closed, there are some infrastructure costs or costs associated with that that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| going to have those costs regardless for the admin costs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| I think it is fair to say that teachers or teaching positions, you probably would eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| garner some costs there because the teachers presumably would follow the kids. I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| that for Mill Creek, we actually did recognize some costs and will recognize some costs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| those affected schools where the kids are being zoned into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| So in those instances, we would have some costs, right? So we would have presumably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| positions otherwise residing at other schools simply because those schools' populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| have been relieved and have been decreased. Through the staffing formula, those positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| it would require less teachers at those schools. Obviously, it would require more teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| at the new schools because of the zoning. So in those instances, we do have savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1169)|
| 0:19:39| because simply the teachers would follow the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| You probably don't get things like, okay, 25 kids left, you know, school A to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| school B because it would be nice if you could just take 25 kids from every grade band and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| shift it over there. It doesn't really quite work that way for obvious reasons. When you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| have zonings, you may have less than 20 kindergartners move over and then you may have more than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| let's say, 25 third graders move over. So you will get into some diseconomies of scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1208)|
| 0:20:16| at times, but there are operational savings when we do those rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| Okay. Thank you. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| Commissioner Ward, before I recognize you, I just want to announce if anyone has tuned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| in that this is actually the scheduled time for beer board to begin. And I believe our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| beer board chair has decided that that will be pushed back to 4.30. So anyone tuning in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| we will hear beer board at 4.30. Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| I'm just going to piggyback on Commissioner Schoomaker's comments. From my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| correct me if I'm wrong, we're either, I believe we have less students now than we did 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| ago or basically flat almost. I would say that's flat, at least over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| last eight years. Okay. Over the last eight years, we're flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| We have more schools and some schools, we're not even close to capacity. Other schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| were over capacity. And so is this more of a redistricting issue that we're facing? We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| need to look at redrawing the lines, not us, but the school board needs to be redrawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| the lines or does Commissioner Schoomaker have a point where some of these half-filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| schools or quarter-filled schools need to be closed down and merged into other schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| I understand what he's trying to say is, are we really optimizing the dollars that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| spending to the most efficient way possible? Especially looking at, we just spent an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| on is more financial hard times coming down the line. Like, do we need to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| to the school board and say, hey, you guys got to do your job and bite the bullet and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| redistrict the schools. So we're more evenly across the county or is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| I certainly don't discount that. I will say that when you go back over, say, the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| eight years, and you're right that the enrollment has not appreciably increased or decreased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| one way or another. So when we look at that increased funding, probably 97% of that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| been through either sales tax, natural growth, because we've benefited through a good economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| Even during the COVID years, when we really pull back on the budget, those sales tax collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| held up. And in fact, for two years in a row, we actually had back-to-back record collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| And so the schools, fortunately, we benefited from that. There was also a record historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| increase from state education funding, right? And so what we've tried to do during those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| times is really plow a significant amount of those investments into compensation enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1371)|
| 0:23:00| because we wanted to greatly increase teacher salaries and bring them up to more competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| levels. We have made some strides over the last couple of years, and I'm thankful to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| the board and thankful to this body that have allowed us to do that. And so we have made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| a lot of strides in that area. What was telling to us is that when we engaged the study with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| Evergreen Solutions was just how far off we still were on some of these positions. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| in some of the harder-to-staff positions like custodial, educational assistance, school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| secretary, school security, some of those school nutrition workers, some of those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| continue to be hard to staff. We continue to experience a lot of turnover, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| he had put a significant amount of dollars to try to raise those salaries up to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| competitive levels. But what was really striking is when the results came in, still some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| those jobs that we noticed were still not in necessarily that competitive market range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| even though we had made great strides to do that. So we invested heavily in compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| and enhancements, invested heavily in medical insurance such that the employer portion funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1447)|
| 0:24:16| more of those increases than the employee did. So we tried to unburden the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| with those costs as well. There were also, it's also been a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| somewhat in the sense that we've had to invest heavily in what we would call compliance positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| or critical needs positions. Specifically, students with disabilities or English language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| learners, there are very precise requirements and ratios required for English language learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1478)|
| 0:24:48| Once you hit that ratio, you're required to hire a teacher to do that or to help support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| those students. Also, again, students with disabilities, we've noticed that a considerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| number of educational assistants we've had to hire over the years simply as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| of individual education plans, that we are required to meet those standards. And so when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| we began to look, a lot of the investments went towards that. Also, mental health supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| and interventionists, we've noticed that over the last several years, even some prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| COVID, but particularly with the COVID years, we've noticed that students have developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| very different needs in some cases than where we were before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| And then we mentioned the new schools. We talked about the new schools, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Schoonmaker brought that up, that required additional staffing. In some cases, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| completely, starting from scratch on those schools like Mill Creek, we're kind of moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| staff over. But no doubt when you do, when you open schools, I know with Gibbs Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| and I think that was one of them, I missed one, Harden Valley Middle is another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| So your staffing base increases naturally with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| So anyway, there's a lot of factors that went into where did we invest those dollars? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| can tell you that the majority were invested into the classroom with teacher pay. And our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| hope is that with implementation of the results of the salary study, we're going to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| an even better position than we were. But were it not for the incremental increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1582)|
| 0:26:31| to bolster those salaries for teachers and other support staff, it would have been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| far heavier lift this year to try to get there. So we did gain some ground. Had we not done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1596)|
| 0:26:45| that, it would have been, I think, very difficult to even get in some of those market ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| To come back to Commissioner Schoonmaker's point, I think, is do we need to be even better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| stewards of that so we can pay teachers even more? Because in my opinion, we're still short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| at $50,000 on paying teachers. I think they should be paid more than that. That's a personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| opinion. But if we're not being good stewards of our capital dollars and we have half-filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| schools and are we just not being efficient enough where we can even give more money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| teachers and put more money into the classroom is more of the question I'm asking. Do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| need to be redistricted so we have a more even... Are you getting the most out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1641)|
| 0:27:31| dollars that are being spent is what I'm getting to or what Commissioner Schoonmaker and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| are getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Right. And I appreciate that question. I think it is a fair question. One of the struggles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| we have is that this population growth doesn't occur proportionally in every segment of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| So should we be redistricting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| And so if you've got overcrowding, particularly in the West sector, and I'm not going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| every school, but a considerable number of schools, the only way to remedy that through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| redistricting is you have to just start pulling. Because the population center is not evenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1682)|
| 0:28:12| parsed across. So we do run into some... I do think you make some great points, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| we do run into some challenges at times in trying to... How might be the most efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| and best way to make those...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| That was Mr. Schoonmaker's point that are we closing down schools since we're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| new ones in more populated areas? I'm being a dead horse at this point, so I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| move on, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you. I will add just for some clarification, too, that looking at closing some schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1717)|
| 0:28:47| has certainly been visited in the past. I don't know how many half-empty schools we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| have sitting out there, but I'd say not more than a very small handful, very, very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1733)|
| 0:29:03| handful. It is not like we are overrun with those. And just also the consideration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1743)|
| 0:29:11| closing a school, not to mention that it's very difficult for a community, is often the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1751)|

| 0:29:24| end up going to whatever school the other school might be, which, as we know, personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| is the biggest part of any cost in running a school. Rarely is there much of a cut significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1771)|
| 0:29:39| at all for teachers. Also, our transportation costs have soared through the roof, and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| you consider some of the geographic challenges of closing a school and then having to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1786)|
| 0:29:54| for extra transportation to bus students 10 or 12 or 15 miles, and sometimes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1794)|
| 0:30:02| means right to the center of town in the middle of rush hour traffic, then that negates many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1802)|
| 0:30:11| times a lot of cost-saving, too. So just other food for thought. Sometimes it isn't quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| as cut and dry as it might appear when we talk about close a school to fix a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| solution. I appreciate that, and you can clearly see that Ms. Hill's experience on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| the school board is certainly, you know, duly noted that some of these things we've grappled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1829)|
| 0:30:39| with for quite a while. Yes, we have. I appreciate you saying that. Thank you. Thank you. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| Jay? Thank you, Madam Chair. What was the last year that Knox County Schools redistricted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| I may need some help on that one. Well, we redistricted about two years ago. No, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| when did Knox County Schools redistrict? Did you follow that same every 10-year cycle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1857)|
| 0:31:06| I may not be following the question. With regards to board districts or with regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| to your school districts? I just answered that. We had a redistricting two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1870)|
| 0:31:21| when we opened a new school. We've never sat down, to my knowledge, and wholesale redistricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| an entire county. That's my question. When's the last time the entire county was analyzed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| for the population and the district lines of schools? I don't know that that's ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| happened because what controls it is the location and the density of the population. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| looking at the entire map, like you're saying. It's looking at the areas where it's so dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| I understand. I think what, Commissioner, I'm sort of piggybacking. This was not my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1916)|

| 0:32:06| at a census, and we redistrict our entire county based upon where population grows and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| everything else as a wholesale. We don't just say this little area has grown, so we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| another commissioner over here. I don't think the school system is doing a wholesale approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| to that same thing. I would encourage them to follow the same redistricting, but doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| it on a wholesale level because it may change the lines. It's the number one most unpolitically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| popular thing to do, but the most important thing to do because we put a new school and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| everybody wants to go to the new school, and then the next school suffers. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| what you're trying to get to. Is that correct? Yes. That was what I was trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| It needs to be a systematic overhaul. Have we ever done an analysis on what we're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| spending money on and where the students actually follow that and everything else? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| I'm a little unclear even the process if that would reside with, because I'm really not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| sure. I'm not prepared to speak to that. I don't know if that would reside with the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| of Education. It might, or if that would reside with county commission as well, but I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| sure, so we would have to look into that. Mr. Caldwell, I have a question on page 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| of the proposed budget. Can you just please explain? You have the capital outlay detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| in here, and I have a column that says funded by debt proceeds. Can you just please explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| Sure. You will also find that in our capital plan. What we do is we used to fund this separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2015)|
| 0:33:47| so we fund it now through our capital plan, but we structure it to where we pay for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| items in the first five years of bonds. This is all bonded debt? It is. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2032)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Are there any other lights, questions, or comments? Seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2045)|

| 0:34:19| wanted to make... Just in closing. Okay. Just a quick question. Historically, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| commission has held a separate meeting to approve the budget since 2017, and it's now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2067)|
| 0:34:36| on our agenda for next Monday night to approve? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| Is that at the direction of the finance team to do that? Just because historically we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2080)|
| 0:34:50| always had it as a separate meeting. That was a discussion that Commissioner Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| and I both had together. We do have also the second budget hearing coming up at 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2095)|
| 0:35:05| right before our second meeting. Do you have a problem with that? No. I'm just asking how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| that decision was made. It came from finance? Well, not exclusively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| We always look to the chair. When I met with Chair Lady Hill, I was like, here's some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2119)|
| 0:35:30| Here's what we have historically done. A special call meeting. We've also voted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| May. We've done some other things. We went over options. Being the budget was what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| was, she thought it was best to go ahead and put it in May, so that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| That's very fair. I did want to wrap this up before the end of May, being as flat and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| unsexy as it is. Thank you, Director Caldwell. Thank you. You bet. Any other questions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2152)|
| 0:36:06| comments? Seeing none, we will adjourn and beer board will begin at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240513-public-hearing?start=2166)|
