| 0:00:00| Good evening. Welcome to the Board of Education's July 8th work session. Please stand as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=0)|
| 0:00:11| observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=11)|
| 0:00:24| I place the flag, pledge, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=24)|
| 0:00:46| We hope everyone had a wonderful Fourth of July. I can't believe we're already into the second half of summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| I feel like this is the part of the summer that school is right around the corner and it's pumpkin spice season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=51)|
| 0:00:56| So we are looking forward to school starting back in just a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| And before we move on to our agenda, I just want to say that I have heard from several parents over the past month about special education and I appreciate those students or those parents reaching out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=60)|
| 0:01:15| And I would like for Dr. Brown, if you don't mind, kind of going over what we have done in the past year for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=75)|
| 0:01:24| And I do have an ask of Dr. Reiswick and your team after we hear a little bit about that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=84)|
| 0:01:32| Absolutely. Thank you, Madam Chair. So I was fortunate to step into this position in mid-February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| So there was a lot of things happening and in the works before I stepped into the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| But just as a summary of some things that have happened, I think since some of the recommendations and your adoption of the resolution last fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| one of the first things we did was we formalized the policy and procedure for the use of private practitioners in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| So we've got private practitioners coming into schools now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| And that's something, again, I have also been involved this spring in working with the special ed council to continue to work on that procedure to make it more accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=120)|
| 0:02:08| So I talked to Ms. Jones today and everybody is filling out the new forms on the portal and getting ready to go for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| So that's still making positive headway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| We also hired Chelsea Price as our first student success advisory and improvement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| So that was another recommendation that came out of both the task force and, I believe, your resolution last fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| was to hire an independent attorney to help consult with us and advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| So we've done that and that's going very well. She's been a huge asset to our division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| We developed a KCS way for special education to formalize a student first approach to developing IEPs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| again, trying to normalize that process across the district and really make consistent experience for all of our parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| and really focusing on the student first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| More recently, we've been in conjunction with our strategy division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| We've been doing an overhaul of the complete website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| but they kind of did a pilot launch on the special ed website to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| make a more user-friendly experience for parents and families and those needing support through special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| Also, back in the fall, I failed to mention that you all approved the contract with ESS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| which helped fill a lot of our vacancies and, again, provide better services to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| With some reorganization this spring, we have moved the special ed family liaison out of our division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=214)|
| 0:03:43| and actually into the office of the ombudsman to increase access for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| And then now the most recent thing we've done is obviously taking some of those willing members of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| and forming a non-time-bound special education council that I continually work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| and communicate with to continue to, as we work to improve our processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| always getting those parent feedback and having their input as we seek continuous improvement in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| especially education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Thank you for that recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| I think we have done some great work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| I think we do have a way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| You know, the resolution was adopted last September, so we are nine months into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| So I would love to see, I know August is busy because it's the first week of school, the first month of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| So I would love to, starting in September, getting like a quarterly update and report on where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| Specifically, I'd like to hear about the progress on the RFP and the strategic planning work we have going on in special education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| and also on the progress that we're making towards goals on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| So if that's possible, I'd love to see that starting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| I'd be more than happy to share the progress we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Again, I think looking through the lens of continuous improvement, there's obviously not a destination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| but we want to continue to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| We're never going to reach a point where we've arrived, but we're going to constantly look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| regardless of how good we are in certain areas, we want to continue to improve and get better at everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| so we provide the best experience for our students and our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| Yes, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| I think it's work that is continuous, and that way, with these reports, we can see what's going well, what we have to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=328)|
| 0:05:36| And I know every year in a student's life, in my life, a year isn't that big of a deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| but in the life of a student, that's a huge chunk of their educational career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Well, do we have any requested changes to this meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| On with our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Dr. Wisewick, do you have a report for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| I just want to say, too, thank you for asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| I think that's work in the special ed place that we really want to share, the work that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| And I know, you know, appreciate Andrew stepping into that leadership, a little change of leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| I think we have some pretty good progress starting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| There's some great things, as we've mapped out this summer, kind of next steps and things to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| So, you know, I look back at things like practitioner partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| I know a number Andrew shared with me the other day was, you know, we didn't have any, like, prior to that policy being passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| And last year we approved 269 practitioner partners to come in and work in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| I think only six were denied, and that was based on not meeting the drug test certification and background certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| So, you know, there is real progress happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| I know it's never fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| We agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| And so we think that's a great idea to be able to update those regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| So thank you for asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Thank you also for the chance to provide some updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| I'd like to begin by highlighting some great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Last month, the Tennessee Department of Education released the latest TCAP assessment data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| and Knox County Schools saw scores increase in all four categories compared to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| As you know, we're prioritizing foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| I want to mention two areas that are of particular interest to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| In our district-wide numbers in early literacy, KCS crossed the 50 percent proficiency line in fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| That's an important milestone well ahead of the state averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| It's the highest we've ever had in fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| So 50 percent, I know it means 50 percent or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| We get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| That's why back to continuous improvement mindset, we continue to drive in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| But, you know, I've been in the district for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| We've never been at that mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| So that does show the work is paying off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| We also increased third grade reading proficiency again to 43.5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| That's an unprecedented 5.2 percent increase over two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| So we've seen that grow substantially as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| But the work's not just in early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| Also in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| In math, there's still work to do, but we are making gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| We saw a 6.1 percent increase in grades three through eight proficiency over the last two years, up to almost 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=485)|
| 0:08:13| We were at 33 percent in 2001-2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| So I think it's important to emphasize that we're encouraged by these numbers, but also we're not surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| Over the last two years, we've focused very deliberately on our four key priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| excellence in foundational skills, great educators in every school, career empowerment and preparation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| and success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Our schools have incredible educators, leaders, and school support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| and they're committed to focusing on the right thing and doing these priorities every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| We've also taken proactive steps to boost achievement, including investments in tutoring and high-quality instructional materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| The scores we saw last month are a direct result of these efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| and I want to commend all of our team for all the hard work that they've done to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| I know sometimes it feels like it's just numbers, but, like, behind every one of those numbers is a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| and is a student who's learning to read earlier and getting on track to be able to graduate and be successful for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| So we really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| There's hundreds of things that our staff can focus on every day when kids walk in the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| but they've chosen to have the discipline to focus on the right things, and I think that's why we're seeing these results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| I also want to commend our business and talent team for their continuing to make salaries a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| We are starting the school year this year, as we come into August, as Ms. Henderson just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| with the highest teacher and staff pay in our district's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| On an average, certified teachers saw an increase of approximately 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| I know those raises were coming in just as they were all heading off to vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| so we're anxious to see everyone in a few weeks with their pay increases now that they've come live as far as July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| Our teaching assistants also saw an average increase of approximately 8 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| and our custodians saw an average increase of approximately 8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| This is the right thing to do, and it acknowledges the dedication of our teachers and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| and what they bring to the classroom every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| This has only become more clear over the last two years as our district has seen student achievement continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| There's a correlation there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Having good teachers and staff members stick around and our students doing better as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| As I previously said, these gains are driven by educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| and our hope is that this investment in our teachers' compensation makes it clear how much we value their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| I also want to acknowledge our talent acquisition department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| Currently, of our 91 schools, only four are not 90 percent staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| That's been, again, a lot of efforts on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| I know two years ago when we launched that department, they were kind of, what fruit would that bear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| I think we're starting to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| I really appreciate Alex Moseman and his team's leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| This is a strong showing, and it demonstrates the importance of creating a talent acquisition department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| They continue to focus on recruitment to pay strong dividends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| It's been nice, too, to see people come from other places that want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| We've also had stories of people who were going to retire that have stuck around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| So I think, one, they're enjoying the work and seeing meaningful students move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| and I think this board continues to compensate them and continue to make that an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| And finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize Ms. Christy Woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| who has officially started as chief of staff as of July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| I'm very glad that she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Christy's a veteran educator, school leader, and she's already making a difference in the central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| And, Madam Chair, that concludes my report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Thank you, Dr. Reisweg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Welcome, Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| We're so excited to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Dr. Adams, do we have a custodial staffing update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Madam Chair, members of the board, I'm happy to announce that we've had a significant increase in applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| and, of course, I attribute that to the work of Ms. Hilmegaard and her team and Ms. Hall and her team in their recruiting practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| We are currently at 56 openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| We have zero schools at 50%, which is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| It's not where we want to be, but we are certainly making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| And we have 49 schools that are fully staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| The legislative update, Tennessee School Board Association holds its Summer Law Institute on the 19th and 20th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| And several of us will – several board members will be in attendance along with Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| and I know we'll have some updates after that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| And also, Mr. Dupler, I'm sure we'll take a look at policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| and any changes we need to make to prepare for the next policy review meeting after that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| And our Strategic Planning Committee did meet this month, so I know Ms. Christie has an update for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| We did meet on Monday, June 25th, to discuss stakeholder engagement processes and timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| Our vendor, Milan, Chicago, were here in person for that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| The committee agreed that we do not want to exclude any ideas or issues from the engagement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| but we do want to kind of keep a focus on our four district priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| and a fifth area of focus around the student and family experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| And we had a lengthy discussion about what levels of data we wanted from the engagement processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| and basically landed on wanting them broken down by grade bands, like elementary, middle, and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=793)|
| 0:13:24| Also by region as well, so as far as those processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| The committee members also agreed that we would, I'm sorry, I lost my place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| that we want the engagement surveys to be very intentional with mostly closed-ended questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| with some open-ended response opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| And we confirmed that surveys will be available online and on paper with multiple translations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| Since August is an extremely busy month for family, staff, and community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| the goal will be to launch the engagement surveys to all groups the day after Labor Day, September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| Milan, Chicago representatives are meeting with Ms. Faulkner and Mr. Rutter this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| to discuss data logistics and with their regional directors and supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| including our preschool director, over the next couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| After those important conversations, they will formulate a draft survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| which the committee will receive week of July 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| The committee will meet again on Monday, August 12th, with Milan, Chicago representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| to finalize the survey, which we agreed should be distributed online through ParentSquare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| since your family, staff, and community are already familiar with that platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| While making paper copies easily available, the survey will remain open for approximately three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| The committee will continue to finalize engagement plans with their contracted vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| over the next couple of months with the goal of sharing data and information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| with the full board at our October 24th quarterly work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| I believe the RFP for a vendor to partner with on the strategic planning is also nearing completion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| so hopefully we will have further information to share during the next report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Okay, moving on to our regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| We'll start with items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| C, 1 or 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| 5 or 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| 7 or 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| 9 or 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| 11 or 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| Ms. Wharton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| I just had a quick question regarding the disclosure with Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Am I correct in the understanding that this is only for students who are attending Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| and that they would have knowledge that it is being released to Pellissippi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=970)|
| 0:16:21| Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Wharton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| As far as their knowledge of it being released, these are students who are already connected with Pellissippi State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| and that may be through already engaging in dual enrollment courses, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| Another way they may be engaged with Pellissippi State also, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| can be through some of our post-secondary visits that we're doing with the 865 Academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| UCISE is one of the data points that's talked about in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| and Pellissippi is making moves to make that a component they do with all their students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| and so that one in particular, the sharing of that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| was just about streamlining that for students not having to sit through that assessment again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| And so in that case, it's kind of a layered answer to say what that engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| and what data would be shared would be kind of dependent on how they're engaging with the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| Okay, and it's only those Pellissippi students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Yes, this isn't in any way like an additional layer of recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| It's kids that are already kind of tracking those experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| and it's actually part of a larger piece we've been trying to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| with regards to our post-secondary kind of decision-making and tracking of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| and really the impact of the things they engage in in the high school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| and how that translates into the pathways and things that they both select| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| and then stay on once they go into post-secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| And that's pretty new work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| That's something that always has been very hard to nail down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| but it's part of some stuff we're doing with OverGrad as an organization that we've done that with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Okay, that's great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1062)|

| 0:18:20| All right, moving on then to board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1100)|

| 0:18:40| All right, then moving on to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1120)|

| 0:18:57| All right, contracts, A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| Moving on then, regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I'm sorry, you're on regular agenda item B, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| I thought I would just, for anybody watching who maybe didn't have a chance to read through the consideration for naming the Fairgate High School Stadium in honor of Eddie Courtney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1160)|
| 0:19:30| I thought I would just highlight a couple of things because he is beloved in the Fairgate community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| and so if I have a moment to brag on him, I'm going to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| So the naming committee reviewed an application for the Fairgate High School Stadium to be named the Coach Eddie Courtney Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| and I'm thankful that they've made the recommendation to accept this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| Eddie Courtney served as a KCS PE teacher for 47, maybe even 48 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| with the last 28 as the head coach of the Admirals Fairgate football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| The coach was the fifth winningest coach in Tennessee, including a state championship in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| Evidence of his dedication is never missing a football game while he was undergoing cancer treatments during the 2005 football season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1208)|
| 0:20:17| And for the 2023 season, he became the longest tenured football coach statewide at any public school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| and was recognized as the longest serving teacher at KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| The glowing recommendation letters received from several elected officials and community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| are a sampling of heartfelt admiration felt by so many in the Fairgate community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| I think Dr. Bartlett's summary on the application says it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| Coach Courtney has always led the team and students with the utmost respect and integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| He modeled humility, strength, and perseverance in performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| He has been the role model and standard for the entire Fairgate community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| As Representative Zachary said of Coach in his letter of recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| he has challenged, encouraged, and led his players to be better young men and students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| placing as much emphasis on their personal development as he has their football skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| His impact on generations to come is without measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| Dr. Bartlett and Representative Zachary hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| The impact Coach Courtney has had on so many young men over the years is immeasurable and immense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| I'm proud to lend my full support to naming the stadium in Coach Courtney's honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| and I would ask the board to support it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you. That was very sweet and exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| Okay, C or D? D? Yes, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| Just on item C, I just want to thank Dr. Adams and Mr. Dillingham and Mr. Shover for all their hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1306)|
| 0:22:00| I know that Commissioner Daley and I both met with them several times, and it's been a learning experience for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| A lot goes into finding a piece of property to build a school on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| but I do appreciate their patience and hard work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| Thank you. Ms. Owen? Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| I have a question on 10-D. The five Ford transit vans and one Ford pickup truck, are those replacements or are those new vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1340)|
| 0:22:31| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, so those are new vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| When I say they're new vehicles, I can get you a list of how many vehicles we actually went through the procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1356)|
| 0:22:46| but those are new vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| So they're not replacing something we're getting rid of? These are additional vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Yes, these are vehicles that we had needed for quite some time and couldn't get the vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| and so these are vehicles that we are now able to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Thank you. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| Thank you. E or F? I do have some questions. Go ahead, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1383)|
| 0:23:13| I'm sorry, could we hear some more about the Staff Referral Bonus Program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, sure, would be happy to answer any specific questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| but this is an idea to pilot for this year from our talent team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| We know that the best advertisement for Knox County Schools are those employees that work for us and are having a good experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| and we want to reward those employees that are helping us bring more great educators to fill our vacancies, so that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1419)|
| 0:23:48| And just for the folks who are watching from home and want to know what this is about, can you kind of talk about the process a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| So program details, there's a staff referral online form, electronic form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| Candidates that are referred, in order for the current employee to get the bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| candidates are the referral reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Candidates that are referred must be new to KCS and must be employed in the position by August 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1451)|
| 0:24:21| so to start the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| And there is a tiered reward, so it's $150 for teachers with one to three years of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1464)|
| 0:24:36| classified support staff, school leaders, etc., and then experienced teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| so three or more years of experience as a classroom teacher or a certified teacher would be $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| Thank you, Jennifer and Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| Okay, F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| I do have a couple questions about F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| I know that was a late addition to the agenda, increasing the cost of tickets for football and basketball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| So Dr. Wilson, can you kind of speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Coach Brown, I know you as Coach Brown, is here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Yes, and Mr. Brown may come over here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| Essentially, it's bringing our pricing structure, and it's really setting a maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| which falls under the board's authority to set the maximum ticket prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| but bringing our pricing structure into a more current and comparable pricing structure to several of the districts around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| If you have a chance, I know you have, but if others are interested, you can look at the memo that's attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| and really highlight several examples, I think, of how costs have changed dramatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| since the last time we set ticket prices, which was 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Mr. Brown can tell you too, I think we had some intentions, and this was prior to either of us being in the role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| but there were some intentions around 2020 to come to the board with a suggestion of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| and then we had COVID and it kind of never got lifted back up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| so it's kind of been an overdue item, I would say, for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| But as I said, it's really an attempt to recognize the cost of what it takes to officiate and hold these games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1570)|
| 0:26:19| and run effective programs, and from that, if, Brian, you've got some additional detail you'd like to add or respond to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| Well, we can respond to questions for sure, Madam Chair, board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| The cost has just gone up dramatically for everything that we do in athletics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| and to be able to sustain our programs, the ticket price increase is needed to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| If that isn't done, it raises fees for participants, which are already very high in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| and would have some of our student athletes not participate because the fees would be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| They wouldn't just not ask, they would just not show up and do it because those fees would be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| So we want to try to keep those fees as low as we can, as well as support all of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| There's a few examples on that memo, but I could come up with 50 or 60 more where the prices are almost double,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| or if not higher, for items to run an athletic program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| I do have some questions, but I'll let Ms. Horne go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| My assumption is that the increase in funds stays at the local school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| But I just wanted to verify that for anybody watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Correct. So gates for each of our athletic events stay in that school in those accounts for those teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| Mr. Deepley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Something that Mr. Brown and I talked about is that when the board policy and when we talk about maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1670)|
| 0:27:59| what we're talking about there is that schools can give discounts for season tickets and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| but different schools in Knox County schools do not need to be charging different prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1687)|
| 0:28:16| So once you set the maximum, so for instance, if it goes up to $10 for a football game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1696)|
| 0:28:24| then it's going to be $10 across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Can all schools have a discount for a season ticket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Yes, but it needs to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| And what he means there is if a student at Halls is paying $6 for a ticket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| and the visiting students show up and it's some of our other students on their 10 for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| there would be a large outcry from our families at different places because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| Is there a student price versus, like would this $10, for example, bless you, be for adults and students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1729)|
| 0:28:58| Currently there is not a differentiated price for students and adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Some schools will charge less for students or they will say for certain sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| I'll just say one of our fall sports is girls soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| The first 50 students that show up can get in free or to encourage students to attend lesser attended events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| but there is not a differentiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| Our price as set by the board is a maximum price that we can't exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| Okay. I've just been struggling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I mean, I completely, I think you did a great job with your memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Thank you for breaking all that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| I think it really answered a lot of questions, and I do recognize that all the prices are going up in everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| but the flip side to me is parents and families are also struggling because of rising prices and groceries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| and just everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| So that's where I really struggle is from a family's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| If they have three kids and they're paying that every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| So, I don't know, I've been having a hard time with this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Also, I know it falls under policy I-171.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| I would, Ms. Coney, like to bring that policy back because I know currently it's the board's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| I would like to bring that policy back up for discussion at the next policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| and just see what it would look like and, you know, get everyone else's thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| If we did give that power to the superintendent and Coach Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| and instead of doing like a price, maybe embedding in there like a market value formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| so that way Coach Brown, like say next year we have to raise prices again or in two years or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| that decision-making power is with you and there's just a formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| whether that's the average of the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| I'd like to see that brought back up in policy review if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| Does anybody else have any questions for Coach Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| I just have a couple comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I agree with you that I would like to see some kind of student price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| I think that would help families a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| And I wanted to thank Dr. Wilson for the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| In my mind, we had already done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| So, I appreciate that you let us know where that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Coach Brown, is there consideration or has there been consideration in the past about setting the student price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| Is that something other districts do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| And is that even possible to have two different pricing scales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| It's very difficult to have two different prices for our people that are working our gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| And all of the other school systems around us right now have gone up and they have set theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| There are certain, again, certain sports will do that to try to attract more students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| Typically, football and basketball don't do that because they're the most well-attended events in their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| But for a softball game or a soccer game or sometimes baseball, they will have incentive prices for students to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1906)|
| 0:31:55| It does just make it a little bit more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| I know we do have a few schools that are going to try to go cashless this fall, which makes it easier to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| But, again, this ticket price is a maximum set by our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Schools can choose to have lower for students if they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Or if they sell at lunch up until Wednesday of a Friday football game, they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| And that would be not as hard on them as two different prices at the gate with that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| Sure. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| But what I'm hearing from Mr. Dupler is even though it's a maximum price, the suggestion would be to not veer from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| That's what I'm hearing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| Not necessarily. I mean, not exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| I mean, what I'm recommending to the board and to the school system in general is that we have to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| So, in other words, if you're going to go with a student price, then it has to be consistent across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| And we can't have one school, and I'm not going to name schools, but we can't have one high school saying no discounts, no way, no how, and another school offering multiple discounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1970)|
| 0:33:01| It has to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Coach Brown, have you seen other districts set a flat student rate in addition to an adult rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| Or is that just not common practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| It's just not common practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| These other districts around us have all gone to the 10-8-6 model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| Some of them are actually 10-8-7. Elko is 10-8-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Anderson County is 10-8-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| And three other districts that have not gone up are kind of waiting to see what happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| And they will probably ask for recommendations to move up to this same price so that everyone in the area, when you travel to different places, are the same price at each venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2011)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I just have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| So, is this something that you, I'm assuming, have discussed with their athletic directors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| The burden of travel is always on the school, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| So, I guess my question is, when you look at all of our teams that went to state this year, and we had several, yeah, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2037)|
| 0:34:07| But each of those schools had to come up with the money for transportation and travel costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| And that's a really heavy lift, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| So, the average cost of a team at Spring Fling, if they were there for four days, is about $10,000 to $12,000 they had to come up with outside of their normally budgeted monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2059)|
| 0:34:30| So, this could help offset that dramatically for those teams that are good enough to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| And there's teams that go there regularly and plan for some of that, but even they struggle to meet that extra cost because it is much more now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2076)|
| 0:34:45| I mean, the busing costs, when you go over two hours, most people take charter buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| Those have gone up almost double or triple the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| And when you go overnight, you pay for that room, you pay per diem for that driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| It just adds up very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| And when our soccer team went to state this year, we did, thankfully, have Emerald Youth Foundation, who provided transportation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2100)|
| 0:35:08| But that was a burden to them to come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| For those four days, it probably would have been an additional $6,000 to $8,000 for transportation alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2113)|
| 0:35:21| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Yeah, I mean, having been on both sides of this as a parent with a student athlete and attending and, you know, giving money to kids or whatever to attend games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| it certainly is expensive for the players and their families, and it can get even more expensive when you have additional travel for state and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| So I wish that we didn't need to do this, but obviously prices have increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| So I kind of see this as, you know, you're passing on that burden to people that are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2144)|
| 0:35:53| And I hate that we have to do it, but it seems like it probably would be necessary at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you, Coach Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Item G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| I know that was a late add as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Dr. Wilson, can you kind of speak to this because this is the first time we've seen an item like this on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| Sure, and part of that is why it's a late add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| So as you may remember from some of our conversations around charter in earlier meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| they have the ability to ask for certain waivers around certain requirements from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| One of those is in relation to instructional materials they use in the classroom curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| And so for the past history of Emerald Academy, going back, they have used Witten Wisdom as their curriculum for their early lit K-2 grade bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2204)|
| 0:36:55| And so they followed the same process this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| It's my understanding that they had followed in years past, submitted the request for that waiver to the state directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| State law allows for that or for the LEA to be the one that grants that waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| And so having done that and then some amount of time passing by between it being submitted and them getting feedback from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| the feedback that came back was that the state had made some changes structurally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| and now wanted the LEA to be the authorizing one that would approve that waiver, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| The board would approve that waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| And so that sort of left us in a position of not having done that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| It left them in the position of needing an approved curriculum to begin their work for this year, finish their literacy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| all the things that they're required to do by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| And they're actually held up a little late on that, but the state understands the time crunch they've put them in, and so we're in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| So Teresa and her team, working with Dr. Phillips, went to look at the waiver process the state uses, adapted that for our own local purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2269)|
| 0:38:00| In order to bring a recommendation regarding the waiver for those instructional materials to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| So this is a new process. It's not one that we have typically carried forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| I give kudos to Teresa and to Dr. Phillips for both moving quickly to put a process together that would be one that could serve us in the future should we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2289)|
| 0:38:22| And this waiver in particular is just for a single year in terms of kind of looking at, because they've been using this as a tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2302)|
| 0:38:32| we want to give them the ability to continue to do that on this short time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Okay. Is there a reason they don't use curriculum that's state approved? Like why did they choose this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| Well, even if you go back to, I guess, I want to say last school year, I think it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| we shifted some of our elementary schools and actually one of our middle schools, maybe two of our middle schools, off of Wit and Wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| The shift at elementary, as I understand it, and Dr. Phillips, I think she had to step out for a few, she may not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| She could answer that question later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| But I think the core component that makes Wit and Wisdom fall in that non-approved list is that structured foundational skills element that goes into like the phonemic awareness and all of those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2344)|
| 0:39:16| When we used that in our school settings, we had an additional component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| We had an additional component that we used with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I think it was foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| But it was not part of the packaged curriculum that came with Wit and Wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| And so that's why it's not on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| It's not to say that they don't offer a fundamental foundational skills component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| It's just not part of the package with Wit and Wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| And so I'm probably way over my head in deep water on explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| If anybody would like to talk about Wit and Wisdom curriculum, Dr. Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| I was just curious why they choose to use this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| So back in the adoption cycle, Wit and Wisdom was on the list for the knowledge demand strand and listed as a curriculum that is comprehensive for grades three through eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2390)|
| 0:40:04| However, it is not comprehensive for grades kindergarten through second because it does not have a foundational literacy component that teaches the fundamentals of learning to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2404)|
| 0:40:12| It focuses on the reading comprehension strand of the standards more heavily and the writing strand of the standards more heavily than it focuses on the foundational literacy strands or the speaking and listening strands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2412)|
| 0:40:25| That being said, they do have a supplemental resource that they are using in conjunction with Wit and Wisdom to support their K-2 students in learning to read and achieving those foundational literacy standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2425)|
| 0:40:40| One of the things that we, Teresa and I, have talked a lot about is this concept of instructional coherence and how over time we might want to support them in understanding how when you have a comprehensive curriculum where foundational literacy naturally speaks to reading comprehension, it has a coherent model that might support students in grasping those foundational literacy standards more quickly and at a level of mastery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2440)|
| 0:41:08| But they are supplementing with a foundational literacy component to build up the capacity for kids to learn to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| Would it be possible to get the last few years of data for these grades in this particular program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2474)|
| 0:41:24| For kindergarten through second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| So the data that you would have access to is not like a statewide standardized assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| It would be more of that universal screener level data that shows us the prerequisite skills that children need in order to learn to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Yeah, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Does anyone else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| We do have a couple of speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Gordon Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Gordon, if you'll state your name and county of residence, and you will have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| I'm Gordon Gibson, a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| You've heard a lot from Moms for Liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Maybe you should think of me as grandfather for libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| Libraries, I believe, should, of course, be repositories of learning, answering questions students have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| Libraries should also be sources of stimulation, raising questions students have not thought of yet on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2543)|
| 0:42:32| We live in a time when these qualities of libraries are under attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| I'm proud that the church I attend has responded to the diminishment and narrowing of books available in classrooms by hosting the Children's Diversity and Justice Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2557)|
| 0:42:49| This library collection includes books in which children encounter characters who look like them, have issues like them, and have backgrounds like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2569)|
| 0:43:01| Books, in other words, which may have been stripped from school bookshelves because they may deal with immigration, racism, sexism, homophobia, and other very real issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2581)|
| 0:43:12| Your hands are tied by poor decisions made by Tennessee legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| This grandfather for libraries is asking you to slow down, take a hard look, and make sure that you are adopting policies that are no more constricting of the books available to our students than those policies absolutely legally must be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2599)|
| 0:43:39| And then, please make it a priority to let our legislators know that they have moved far beyond the limits of their competence with, among other things, legislation on school libraries and instructional materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2619)|
| 0:43:55| Libraries, as I said at the beginning, should raise questions that students have not thought of on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| Be sure that our school libraries send students more deeply into the complexities of American history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| Even though racism, dispossession of Native people, and economic inequality are unpleasant topics, we cannot understand our history fully if we do not think about such issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2649)|
| 0:44:23| Libraries should answer questions that students have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Certainly some legitimate and important questions about human development, sexuality, and human relations are left unanswered in abstinence-only sex education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2666)|
| 0:44:38| Try to keep as many usefully informative books on the shelves as possible to answer some of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2678)|
| 0:44:47| If you don't help students get answers, they will turn to their poorly informed friends or just look at the first thing that pops up in a Google search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2687)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Michael O'Malley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Michael, if you'll state your name and county residence, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Michael O'Malley, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| This is regarding the I-241 school libraries policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| I know you'll have to comply with the Age Appropriate Materials Act and the changes that have been made to it by the legislators, so I'm not asking you to reject this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2717)|
| 0:45:24| But some of the discussion at policy review did kind of bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| I'm an English teacher at Carter High School and a Christian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| And at policy review, Mr. Dupler indicated to the board that the law would not remove the Bible from libraries because the Bible doesn't describe sexual acts in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| And as an English teacher and a Christian, I would encourage you all to take another look at how much detail the Bible uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| I'll use just a few passages that might create challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| For an example, there's Genesis chapter 38, verse 39, which talks about a man named Onan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| Quote, whenever he slept with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| Leviticus chapter 15, 16 through 18 describes how to clean yourself up after sex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| Quote, when a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body with water and he will be unclean till evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| Any clothing or leather that has semen on it must be washed with water and will be unclean till evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| When a man has sexual relations with a woman and there's an emission of semen, both of them must bathe with water and they will be unclean till evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| Ezekiel 23, 20 to 21 uses an extended sexual metaphor to describe Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| Quote, she lusted after her lovers whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was that of horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| So you longed for the lewdness of your youth when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| The revision of the Age Appropriate Materials Act states that material with sexual conduct must not be maintained in a school's library collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| I have to say, descriptions of ejaculation, breast fondling, and a penis the size of a donkey's sure sound like they fit the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| During policy review, Ms. Horn said that she doesn't think the law was intended to get rid of the Bible, and I do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| However, we follow the letter of the law and not the intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| This law is written in a careless and indiscriminate manner that omits any consideration of the literary, historical, or religious value of a text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| I have a lot to say about how contextually the sexual content of the Bible has some merit, and perhaps some of you do too, but our legislators have not permitted us to make those justifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2827)|
| 0:47:16| I hate the idea of the Bible or any other text of value being locked away from student access, which is the opposite of what we as educators should be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| If you don't like the Bible being taken out of school libraries, perhaps you should tell our legislators how destructive their handiwork is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| But if KCS believes, as policy review indicated, that the Bible should stay on library shelves, that seems to me like a violation of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| I've seen a lot of people come before this board and complain about passages in books that are not any more explicit than what I've read to y'all from the Bible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| and some of y'all on the board have expressed outrage at the allegedly inappropriate materials in our school libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| So if you don't think that the new law applies to the Bible, I guess I have to ask, why does my Christian scripture get a pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| Do y'all actually care about sexual content in books, or does it only bother you when gay or trans or contemporary black and brown authors do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Moving on to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| I would just like to bring something to the attention of the administration that I forgot to do earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| I've had some calls about the calendar for 25-26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| I know it's way off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| There's a half day that is December 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| That's a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| And so people are now noticing that that's a Monday half day before break, and they have a lot of concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2915)|
| 0:48:44| And lots of I'm not showing up that days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| So if we could take a look at that sometime, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| I'll say this because Dr. Wilson talked to me about that today, and he might be able to explain that, or you might want to follow up later with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| But I think it was a choice of the lesser of two evils, I believe, what it ended up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| Yeah, and I'm, again, always happy to go back and look at additional options and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| It's a pretty long process that we go through to come up with three options to bring to a committee to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| And it's easy to say it's a hard year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| But even as we were talking today, like if you start looking out into the future, you'll see like when we get into this year, for example, Memorial Day for the 25-26 calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2957)|
| 0:49:28| Memorial Day is on the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| That's the final Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| What that means for us is we typically get out before Memorial Day is we've lost a whole week because the next year it's on the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2973)|
| 0:49:40| So we've lost a whole week to play within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| And that begins to really back things up and affect things like length of Christmas break and those sorts of different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| So, again, there's some complexity just depending on how days fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| It has been typical practice that we do not bring teachers back prior to August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| It's been typical practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| We don't bring teachers back after Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| And when you start to balance that window of time into what you're trying to fit in election days, in-service days, all the things that you're doing, you're not left with a whole lot of wiggle room in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3003)|
| 0:50:14| And so the decision, I think, and kind of the critical point where we fell out on those options was we had that Monday coming back for the half day before Christmas break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3014)|
| 0:50:24| Or we had a scenario where we were going to probably be bringing teachers back on the Tuesday after Memorial Day to do their last day of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| That are also in that consideration is the balance of academic days across the two semesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| You don't want to have five or six days difference between how many days are in your fall semester versus your spring semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3037)|
| 0:50:45| And moving one day, one each of the way can affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| So we have certainly looked at and considered lots of things around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| And I'm always happy to go back and look at that again to see what those options might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| But we followed the procedure that we have always typically followed in terms of convening a group that's made up of central office and school level folks, parents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3057)|
| 0:51:07| And brought them options that we felt like were the least evil of the group and came out with a vote that went with the calendar that we adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3067)|
| 0:51:19| Thank you. I appreciate that. I've also talked to some people who were on those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| And I think they would like to have had a lot more input into possibilities than just the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| So maybe we could look at that somewhere along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| I know there are a lot of people who are very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| They sort of feel like they're losing three days of holiday travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| So I know they would very much appreciate having a look at that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| Thank you. Mr. Watson? Mr. Triplett? Ms. Fike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3109)|
| 0:51:58| Thank you. I'm going to keep with my pattern of the things that we're celebrating this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| July 4th, like we talked about, is the day the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence in 1776.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3124)|
| 0:52:13| And it began being signed on August 7th, 1776. A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| But the American Revolutionary War didn't end until 1783.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| And I think that's just something, as an adult, to revisit and think about is really interesting, the years that go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| Because we often just think of July 4th and that was independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| But it actually took a whole lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| And then also, in the month of July, we celebrate Disability Pride Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| And Disability Pride can be described as accepting and honoring each other's uniqueness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| and seeing it as a natural and beautiful part of human diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| On July 26th, 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act was the world's first comprehensive civil rights law for people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3172)|
| 0:53:01| President George Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act in a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| And I think that a story that I'm going to try to make very quickly is I was partially running an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3188)|
| 0:53:19| and we had invited some adaptive, different types of adaptive persons to attend and to be a part of a forum on a stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3199)|
| 0:53:31| And that hadn't been done for that event before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| And we realized that, obviously, steps were not going to suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| And that we had to build a ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| And last minute built a ramp and then realized that actually the ramp saved us all from going up and down the stairs through the whole event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3221)|
| 0:53:48| And that it was actually a benefit to all of us to have the ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| And I like to think of that of when we use inclusion and we include everyone, that we actually all benefit from something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3231)|
| 0:53:59| And how I've seen this in Knox County schools and where I'm really appreciative of our teachers is looking at each of their classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| and what they do with lighting and the general feel of the environment of the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| And I'm really appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| I apologize, but I did come up with something that I remembered that we probably needed to at least put on our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3267)|
| 0:54:35| And that is the November meeting, November 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| We have a scheduled meeting, but that's also the TSBA Leadership Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| Oh, it's earlier this year, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Yeah, so we might want to take a look at that and talk about how we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| Yeah, how to make both those work, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| See you all Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240708?start=3303)|
