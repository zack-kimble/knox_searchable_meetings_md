| 0:00:00| We're getting ready to start our second part of our budget hearing on the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=0)|
| 0:00:24| Clerk, would you have the roll call, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=24)|
| 0:00:27| Commissioner McKenzie. Commissioner Strickland. Here. Commissioner Mark Harmon. Here. Commissioner Campin. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=27)|
| 0:00:36| Commissioner Norman. Commissioner Ivan Harmon. Commissioner Davis. Commissioner Daniels. Commissioner Hammond. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=36)|
| 0:00:44| Commissioner Luthold. Commissioner Briggs. Commissioner Roundtree. Commissioner Lambert. Commissioner Smith. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=44)|
| 0:00:52| Commissioner Moore. Commissioner Ballard. Commissioner Wright. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=52)|
| 0:00:58| Commissioner DeFries. Here. Commissioner Pinkston. Here. Nine members present. Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=58)|
| 0:01:05| We have ten members that are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| Before we start, I want to make a couple of statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| The reason we're basically having this hearing is because we had about 20, maybe 25 people that had called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=73)|
| 0:01:19| They wanted to come before a commission, and they wanted to do it at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| and I knew that wouldn't be the right time, especially after we spent so many hours on other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| So we set this aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| This meeting is not to add, not to delete, but to listen to these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=91)|
| 0:01:38| I know it's been a lot of good reading in the paper and a lot of good listening on the news, but that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| This is not to take, not to delete, but to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| We will have another session where we will debate the total budget, and this is not the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| So commissioners, this is more of a listening to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| We have a tight schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| We have enough people right now in five minutes apiece that we'll probably be here until four or five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| So we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| I think a lot of you have an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| We have one thing that's going to be moved on the agenda, and we'll go with the agenda the way it's set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| So first I'd like to call in Lisa Vinnie, Arts and Cultural Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| You're not Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| I'm not Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| No, I couldn't even match Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| My name is Jeff Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| Our executive director is in Denver attending a conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| so I'm here to represent the Arts and Cultural Alliance as its current board president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| First, we would like to take the opportunity to thank the commission for their past support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| With your support in 2007, the Alliance provided valuable in-service training to 80 Knox County school teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| and created and promoted an online box office service catering to the out-of-town tourist market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| In 2006, we created and distributed a brochure promoting 23 museums and historic homes to the tourism market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| With your continued support next year, the Alliance will launch an advertising campaign titled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| There's More to Knoxville, designed to increase the public's awareness of Knoxville as an exciting place to work, live, and visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=193)|
| 0:03:21| Knox County taxpayers can be proud of our use of your investment in the areas of education, economic development, and tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| The Alliance plays an important role in the education of Knox County school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| Over the past six years, we have paid the transportation and admission fees for over 157,000 school children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| to attend arts and culture events at no charge to the schools or the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| In addition, each summer, the Alliance provides critical in-service training to Knox County school teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| at no cost to the school or the teacher to improve their classroom effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| The Alliance's Emporium Center for Arts and Culture draws more than 30,000 people downtown every year to enjoy First Friday events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| In fact, the Knoxville Area Chamber Partnership points to the Emporium Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| as an example of the quality of life and entertainment options Knoxville provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| when attracting new businesses and recruiting a talented workforce to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| Finally, the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation promotes the Alliance's Emporium Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| and other programs to attract conventions and draw group tours to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| In these ways, the Arts and Culture Alliance uses Knox County's investment to return dollars to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| in the form of economic development, sales and entertainment taxes, and hotel-motel taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| Regarding the use of citizen panels this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| the Arts and Culture Alliance supports the use of well-educated and impartial panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| to inform the government granting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| As the umbrella organization for the county's arts and culture groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| the Alliance is, however, concerned that over one-third of the applicants did not receive even partial funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| even though a fourth of these groups had received grants for the past three to four fifties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| We hope that you will listen carefully to those that appeal the decisions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Keep Knoxville beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| Good morning. My name is Allison Teeters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| I'm the executive director of Keep Knoxville Beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| And my staff member is going to pass out bags to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| These are car litter bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Who in here wants to go to a dirty city or county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| If you see someplace dirty, you assume it's ridden with crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| Trash is associated with crime, so we are trying to keep Knoxville beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| This is our 30th year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| And in this bag, I put a few little things for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| I put a Don't Throw Down on K-Town bumper sticker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| We want everybody to remember that this is a beautiful city, a clean city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| And so we gave you a bumper sticker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Stop Litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| That is the state campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| And we are doing our best to stop litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| If you see a litter bug, call the state number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| They'll get a letter from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| It's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| And then just a little fact sheet about us and all we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| And I hope that you will use these things and just kind of look over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| We provided $9.85 in non-governmental cash and in-kind contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| for every dollar in government grants that was received in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| Now, we appreciate your support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| and I appreciate you guys coming out this morning and hearing everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| Keeping Knoxville beautiful is very important to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| That's where our tax dollars come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| We get revenue from people who come and stay in Knoxville and in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| and who spend their government dollars here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| We get government funds from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| People aren't going to come if it's a dirty area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| So I'm just pleading with you to please keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| I did not end up in a bad situation from the community panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| but I did want to make sure that you guys remember that we are here still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| And I am just basically trying to make sure you should have all received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| invitations to our Trash Bash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| Now, I realize that everybody had busy schedules and wasn't able to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| but we had over 2,000 people who just completed the Great American Cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| They donated over 3,000 hours of their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| and there is nothing more valuable than time, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| They donated their time to clean up Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| Over 50 miles of roadways in Knox County were cleaned this spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| and we want to thank you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| I need your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| For the record, our physical address or our PO Box 385, Knoxville 37901,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=479)|
| 0:08:09| and our physical address is 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| That's fine? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| And like I said, if you guys need more car litter bags, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| If you're a smoker or you know a smoker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| we have pocket ashtrays we'll give to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| So just give us a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| My card is also in there if you have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| or I can do anything to assist you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| Please give me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| These bags aren't over $35, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| They are about 20 cents apiece, and they were not paid for by county grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| We do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| Copy Bag Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=524)|
| 0:08:56| You're not Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| I just happen to be Linda Hill instead of Linda Paxman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| I need your address also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| I'll give that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Let me get a card and give you the official mail address for the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| Well, you can give yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| PO Box 1772, Knoxville 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=556)|
| 0:09:25| I rarely have an opportunity to serve in this particular capacity for the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| I absolutely am there for the performances and as a musician and as an artist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| But today I get to just share again and celebrate how the company has continued to reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=578)|
| 0:09:49| and serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| The things that I thought might be important to underscore were how we were indeed having success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=592)|
| 0:10:01| with our outreach to adult learners and to our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| As a matter of fact, the Theater Renaissance for Youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| which is the name of our summer youth performance troupe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| just administered their first workshop in training, as trainers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| training other young people in digital storytelling to the Boys and Girls Club yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| That continues to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| And we're bringing families in and serving them with education and development artistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| as well as in leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| The voices of the adult learners whom we've served with Sisters of the Rainbow and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| again, that outreach continues to grow and flourish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| And we are having product such as digital stories from the participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| and compositions of songs and the lyrics that go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=652)|
| 0:11:01| And just finding opportunities to pull different affinity groups together to work and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=661)|
| 0:11:10| One of the things that I think has really affected the city in a larger way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=670)|
| 0:11:21| has been the Show What You Know Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| And as you know, it is a movable feast of cultural events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| celebrating community knowledge and expertise through the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| The purpose of that week has been a community-based arts festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| to build community and to address issues of concern of Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| A civic forum for cross-cultural dialogue and collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| the festival features workshops, performances, and screenings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| exhibits, and community dialogues facilitated by and including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| local and national artists, cultural organizers, and an array of community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| The Show What You Know Festival has been and will continue to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| to serve our community in ways that encourage civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| The nice thing about that, of course, is as we're bringing in national-level touring artists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| and those who support them, technicians, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| we are using our hotels and eateries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| And, of course, when we need to get secure materials and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| that contributes directly into the economic life of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| Next year, we are going to host the National Performance Network's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=760)|
| 0:12:50| annual convention, and that will indeed be exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| and will have an even more dynamic impact, I think, economically on the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| and services and space venues that we have to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| Well, thank you for hearing me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| If there is something that I can give a point of clarification for, please ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| I didn't want to get too verbose, as I am wont to do on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| And I'll just close now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Is there anything further that I should share with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| One change that I told you that we would make would be now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| Helen Ross McNabb will be going now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=816)|
| 0:13:44| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| I'm Andy Black with the Helen Ross McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| My address is 201 West Springdale, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| Mr. Chairman and Commission, I appreciate more than you know the opportunity to come today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| and advocate for the people that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| For the past number of years, probably more than I care to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| the McNabb Center has received county support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| for four particular programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| The first is a therapeutic preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| and this is a program for children four to six years of age who have been abused or neglected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| and will serve 55 children annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| This is the only program of its kind in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| Mother Goose, a child abuse and prevention program that focuses on early brain development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| and parental bonding and will serve 650 families through that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| Friendship House, a client-run peer support rehabilitation program for adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| who are severely and persistently mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| This is the busiest drop-in center in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| We have 360 members and serve 54 people on an average daily attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| And the last area is our emergency access to mental health care for adults and seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=918)|
| 0:15:27| And these are emergency mental health assessments and services for the severely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| and persistently mentally ill who are uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| The proposed FY09 community grant requests have been cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| or reduced to the McNabb Center by right at 64%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| This will effectively eliminate the Mother Goose program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| and it will reduce access for adults and seniors to mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=953)|
| 0:16:03| And I realize that the McNabb Center is not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| 142 requests were received, and 73 or 51% were funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| And you heard Dr. Chapman give the number of organizations that weren't funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| that had been funded for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| This is a radical departure, obviously, from the way that things were done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| I guess my question would be, what changed from physical year 08 to the proposed FY09?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=994)|
| 0:16:45| Are the programs that serve so many no longer necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| I certainly realize the difficulty of your task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Funding for community grants, as I understand from reading the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| was reduced by a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| I understand the need to balance our county's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| At the McNabb Center, we have a balanced budget every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| It was the Citizens Review Panel's charge to evaluate and make recommendations to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:28| The administration in turn accepts, rejects, or changes those recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| and they forward those on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| You then have the authority and the responsibility to accept, to reject, or to change those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:48| I'm not telling you anything you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| That's just our form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| It's a representative form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| and we all have the opportunity to participate in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| What I would like to say is I appreciate very much your providing the opportunity for us to come, for me to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| and advocate for the people that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you, Mr. Black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:22| I'm David Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| I'm the Executive Director of the Knoxville Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| Do you need my institutional address or home address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| That's 1050 Worlds Fair Park Drive, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| I want to thank the commission for the opportunity to make a few very brief points about the Knoxville Museum of Art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| and its importance for this community and the importance of county support for our operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1135)|
| 0:19:03| I don't think I need to say that the KMA is a vital cultural resource for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| It's one of the many things that makes Knox County a really terrific place to live, a great place to relocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:17| We serve about 40,000 people a year, depending on how you count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| It's actually a larger number if you count the many groups that use our facility for their own fundraising events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| Our total budget is about $1.5 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| That's a lot of money to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| It's not a lot of money in the big picture of the way art museums are run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| We put that together pretty much from scratch every year from a variety of sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| The panel recommended an appropriation of $27,500 for the KMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1188)|
| 0:20:02| That's very much in keeping with what we've been getting from the county for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| It represents about 2% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| That doesn't sound like very much, but it's a very key part of the funding picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| About 85% of that $1.5 million that we raise every year comes from private sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| and just under 15% comes from state and city and county sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| We target the money we get from the county to use for our education programs, K-12 education programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:40| that serve about 10,000 students a year from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| both at the museum and in the classrooms in a variety of outreach programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| We also pay for bus transportation for those students to come to the museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| Our funding is very broadly based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| We have about 2,500 members who pay anywhere from $40 a year to $1,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| That's a big chunk of our income picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| We need every bit of that income in order to maintain the level of service that we're very proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| that we've been able to provide to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| Just to put things in perspective, that 27-5 appropriation will pay our KUB bill for two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:31| maybe two and a half months if it's not too hot or too cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| It's a very important part of our funding picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Again, most of that money is dedicated to serving young people, K-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| supplementing what happens in Knox County schools, enhancing the curriculum and touching young lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:54| Again, thank you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| Tennessee Stage Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| My name is Tom Parkhill with the Tennessee Stage Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| Our address is P.O. Box 1186, Knox 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| We do appreciate you giving us an opportunity to come out this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Like Keep Knoxville Beautiful, we scored very well in the panel process and are very pleased with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Having seen how well we scored, I wished I'd asked for a lot more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| We tried to keep our request at a level that any reasonable person would think was reasonable in light of our budget size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| and what we've been getting in previous years from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Our main program for which we ask our funding is Shakespeare on the Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| which is a free public art event out on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Most of our work is education and outreach, and we consider Shakespeare on the Square part of an education and outreach program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| since it is done free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| It is very accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| We see a large range of ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| What's known in underserved populations, we do a lot with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| We have seen a huge increase in our underserved populations since we began working on the Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| But the other thing that's very important about Shakespeare on the Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| we position it and always have and market it as an evening downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| We bring 6,300 people a year downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| In our marketing, we suggest as they come down that they have supper, see the show, do a little shopping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| stay afterwards for a drink, a dessert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| I sent you a packet a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| I know you get tons of mail, so whether you've had a chance to look at it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| I put in that packet some of the supporting information for some of the things I'm about to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| which is that we do a neighborhood impact statement in which we ask all of the merchants in Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| and the downtown area to reflect how our event helps or does not help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| We get a very strong response from the community downtown that our event is a very strong event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| in bringing people into their businesses and creating new income for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Our surveys that we do every year show that 50% of our audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| when they come down to Shakespeare on the Square or coming downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| they reply that they rarely or almost never come downtown previously to coming down to see Shakespeare on the Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| So we are bringing a whole new audience downtown to see the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| and all the new things that are happening downtown and to spend money in the shops downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Events like Shakespeare on the Square, the Rossini Festival, Sundown in the City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| are economic engines that bring people to this area where they will support all the businesses that are going on downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| So in addition to being a free public art event, we do bring a lot of business downtown as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| and help support the community in the new thriving downtown environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| So we are very appreciative of your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| We have received support from Knox County for a dozen years or so, and it means a lot to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| It's a small part of our total financial picture, but we do try to keep our funding spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| so that losing one or losing something somewhere doesn't cripple us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| So we always try to make sure that we're not asking too much from any one source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Just a word on the panel review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| The panel review process is an excellent process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| As you know, starting a new program or a new process is always difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| There will be growing pains, but it's a very fair, very valuable tool for people applying for money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:35| to learn to do a better job of applying for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| So we do appreciate the panel review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| As you reflect on how it went this year, it's, to me, a very valuable and fair process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| and we appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Iams Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1554)|
| 0:26:04| Good morning, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| My name is Paul James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| I'm the Executive Director of Iams Nature Center, 2915 Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| We appreciate everything that Knox County does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| We have a longstanding relationship with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| and I just want to talk today about one project that Knox County is very connected with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| and also a little bit about what Iams Nature Center is up to these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| A lot of people are talking about gas prices, but there is something around the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| around the world, that is on a lot of people's minds, and that is the term green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| And in 1910, almost 100 years ago, the Iams family moved to south Knoxville on Island Home Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| and they helped create the germ in the seed of what became Iams Nature Center that we love today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| And while the Iams family faced a number of different environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| like extensive logging and deforestation, you know, today in 2008 we face as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| similar issues like air quality, pressures on urban development, global climate change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| So Iams' mission works directly with our community to do a number of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| and these are new five priority areas that we've determined at Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| The first one has been conservation and sustainable land management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| The second one is the green earth, applying local and national and global solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| to things like air quality and solid waste reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| Natural history and earth sciences speaks to a big part of our education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| with youth particularly and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Fragile existences is talking about the education with endangered species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| And finally, and not least of importance, is just providing natural connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| for people to get outdoors into the community, whether it's either at Iams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| in that back garden, or any way around the beautiful area that we have in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| Now one of the key projects that we worked with Knox County on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| was the acquisition of Meats Quarry in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| And we opened that project in 2005 to the public, and it's been a major success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| We just added an overflow parking lot on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| It's been used extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| I just want to highlight a few of the restoration things that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| We removed extensive commercial and residential trash from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| We took down the derelict buildings for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| We've created one-and-a-half-mile circular trails around the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| We've installed a series of floating platforms for wildlife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| and even did an extensive three-acre restoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| along the railroad tracks of warm native seeds and grasses last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| And in addition, we also restored the historic Stanton Cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| which is up on the bluff above Meats Quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| And really one of the exciting things about Meats Quarry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| is that it allowed IMES and the Legacy Parks Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| which was a new foundation that was born out of the long-range strategic plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| from the City of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| to acquire a further 103 acres of basically derelict land adjacent to Meats Quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| which will effectively take IMES Nature Center, which is about 268 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| which is really incredible news for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| And that property was donated entirely for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| There's many things that IMES does in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| and I'm not here to comment on the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| but if there is an opportunity for future monies to become available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| I hope that you will consider IMES Nature Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| and the wonderful work we do in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| Good morning. I'm Jim Volna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I'm Executive Director of Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| 3500 Knoxville Zoo Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Exit 392, still open, still available to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| The road closing has not affected us a great deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| thanks to you and thanks to the advertising money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| that we've been able to put to that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| We had the best year we ever had last year in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| and that was 430,088 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| Of that amount, about 42% of that are tourists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| who travel over 100 miles to get to Knoxville Zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| which is a very important point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| because Knoxville Zoo is about 86% earned income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| and what we try to do is to draw as many people into the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| with the economic impact that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| and to partner with the county and with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| and with all of the other organizations in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| That 181,000 tourists that we bring to the area economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| are worth about $15 million on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| The money that you've contributed or invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| in Knoxville Zoo over the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| and in this cycle, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| will go towards our advertising efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| The amount that we've asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| will provide about a third of our advertising budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| which is extremely important in getting the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| The ability to compete with other much larger organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| such as those in Pigeon Forge and Sevierville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| is important to bringing those people to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| and continuing that economic benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| that we have provided in the past to Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| We thank you very, very much for the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| that you have given us over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| and I think it has been a very good partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| We've been able to provide a good service to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| for many of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| About 36% of our admission is from Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| About 50,000 school kids and their chaperones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| come to the zoo every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| and we've become part of their curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| which we provide for schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| I do, again, want to thank you very much for your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1929)|

| 0:32:23| Cheryl Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| I'm president of the East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| Cheryl Henderson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| We are here before you asking to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| your longstanding support of the East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| On August 23rd of this year, in a major celebration downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| the Museum of East Tennessee History| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| will open to the public of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| East Tennessee, and the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| This is a process that started in the late 70s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| At that time, many of you all recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| this building was occupied by the Tennessee Valley Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| under the leadership of then Judge C. Howard Bozeman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| and your predecessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| the Knoxville Fiscal County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| This building was acquired by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| Ultimately, the McClung Collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| which is part of the Knoxville Library System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| moved into the third floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| The archives of Knox County moved into the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| It was always envisioned that the ground floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| would be a museum of East Tennessee history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| which would be provided by the East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| After many years, that is finally coming to fruition on August 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| Our grant application is to help us open the museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| and do a public celebration for the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| and East Tennessee with this grand opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| If you look at the East Tennessee Historical Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| and its relationship with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| I mentioned it ran back at least to the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| It has continued to the present day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| under the leadership of County Executive Dwight Kessel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| County Executive Tommy Schumpert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| and County Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| Each of them, with your all's support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| has expanded the center to its present parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| where it is the jewel in the crown of downtown Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| We are asking for a grant to bring this to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| We also bring many people into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| We're sponsoring a genealogical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| a national or international genealogical conference in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| We work closely with Gloria Ray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| and the Knoxville Sports and Tourism Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| to bring groups to downtown and to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| and will continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| We would ask that you all continue the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| that has gone on for nearly 40 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| for the East Tennessee Historical Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| as we move forward in this great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| Cheryl or I will be happy to answer any questions you have about the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| and we do have a handout which we're going to pass to you all at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| showing some of the events that are coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| including the museum opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Thank you very much for consideration of our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| James White Fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| Sam Maynard, James White's Fort, 205 East Hill Avenue, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| I believe everyone in here knows what James White's Fort is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| and you have visited one time or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| either as a kid or as an adult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| which is the beginning of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| You know, James White came here in the 1780s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| and built his first little log cabin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| and built his fort around it two years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| which in 1791 the city of Knoxville was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| We have a lot of school kids coming into the fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| and a lot of tourists from all over the country and all over the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| which we do have listings of all those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| We serve as an educational tool also to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| as long as our heritage of what the fort means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Different things we have during the year at the fort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| such as we first begin off with May Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| which is May the 1st, which we work with Mercy Medical Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| We had open plant swap with the seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| and invited the other public to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| We had actually swapping plants, buying plants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| and had the fort open for a free day also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| We have our historical tours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| which we teamed up with the other historical landmarks in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| and we had tour buses that went to different directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| such as from James White Fort, Ramsey House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| John Svear Home, which is Marble Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| another one with Blunt Mansion, Crescent Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| and Mabry-Hazen House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| We all try to team up together, all of us historical structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| We are working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| and it's a very good partnership that we do have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Junior dozen stays, which we just have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| and I think some of you did come out to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| We had it with the Episcopal School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| That's where the kids dress up in the period costume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| They come and have a briefing with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| and then they're sitting around to different directions of the fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| in the main house, at the kettle, at the outhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| in different directions, and telling the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| their grandparents, their aunts, uncles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| the parents and all of the Episcopal School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| about the fort and how it began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| which is their third year for that, and it's very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| The school really enjoys it, and the kids will enjoy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| and they'll remember it to their adulthood also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| Statehood Day we just had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| which we also teamed up with various locations of historical landmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| It was the beginning of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| which it began right here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| basically with Blount Mansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| and also an old house that was behind the First Tennessee Bank at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| We did that on May 31st and June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| June 1st is the actual date of the beginning of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| which Knoxville was the first capital of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| July 4th, which we have ever since the fort opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| a July 4th day, which we have with the Revolution period people coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| and we have a little ceremony for about an hour and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| which we have refreshments for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| and a 21-gun salute that's been going on since 1970 at the fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| Our Cherokee Heritage Days, which is coming up on August 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| where we bring in the Cherokee Indians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| We have all kinds of different activities going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| We do charge admission for this because we had to pay for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| so we do charge admission, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Cherokee Heritage Days has the roles of the Indians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| the way it was in the 1780s when James White was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| which he did speak the Cherokee language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| and also the negotiation of the Treaty of the Holston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| which you do see a sign up in front of the building next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Also, Heart Scares is coming up in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| where we have our Ghost Tours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2379)|

| 0:39:44| of the different areas of what happened in the beginning up to the 1800s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| which we have all week long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| and we have a large crowd that does attend that for a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| And then we have the open house on the first Thursday in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| where we open the fort up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| We have all kinds of baked goods and a hot cider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| and welcome the community to come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2406)|

| 0:40:12| along with all the other historical landmarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2412)|

| 0:40:28| They also do their shopping in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| And basically, we're just asking for just a little help for the fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| We're not asking for full funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| We're just happy to be here with you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| and be the first home in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| O'Grace Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| I'm Gaines Pittenger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| president of the Old Gray Educational, Historic, and Memorial Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| We are a nonprofit cemetery founded in 1850,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| probably the oldest one in Knox County still surviving as a planned cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| We have 13 acres on North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| We host many school groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| We serve as a green space with our 13 acres for downtown residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| open 24-7, no admission charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| The marble and granite tombstones in the cemetery make up the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| and probably the most notable outdoor art museum in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| Our request today is for the county's assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| with a restoration of an 1850 receiving vault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| Our architect, Charles Richmond, is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| and can answer any questions and explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| I hope you received a handout this color that has a description of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| I'm Charles Richmond, 428 East Scott Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| I've been working with Old Gray for a number of years on the restoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| generally of the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| During that time, we noticed that the front wall of the receiving vault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| was leaning outward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| We had a contractor dig out behind the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| and found out that it had separated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| that front wall had separated from the body of the main building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:45| It's our desire is to actually tear that wall down and rebuild it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2565)|
| 0:42:56| There is ways to stop the continuing leaning of the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| which will eventually fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| In the photograph you have, there's a second photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| It will show where the credit card is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| That's the section of the front wall pulling away from the main building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:21| Anyway, that's our immediate need today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Krishna Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| Yes, Mr. Richmond, I don't see where you had a grant request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| Have you just come here today, or were you involved in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| It's Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| It's labeled as Knox County Old Gray Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Aha, found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| African American Appalachian Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:08| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| My name is Nkeki Ojanaku.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| I'm the Executive Director of African American Appalachian Arts Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| Couldn't wait for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| A couple of months ago I got a call, had an interview with the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| And I wasn't quite sure that I was quoted correctly because I wanted to tell you what I told them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| is that I didn't have an attitude about Knox County and the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| I was like, how dare I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| In the last 19 years, the Knox County commissioners have been so gracious to our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| African American Appalachian Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| There were times in the 19 years that we've been in existence in producing the Kaumba Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| and also spearheading the development and developing Haley Heritage Square for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| that many people didn't come to our side for assistance, and the Knox County commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| So I was saying that here in 2008, I would be ridiculous for us and our organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| to say that we're angry about something or that we have an attitude about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| The only way we can have an attitude with Knox County is an attitude of graciousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| I just wanted to say, and I keep this in my tongue at all times, thank you to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| And thank you to the Knox County commissioners because in these 19 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| we have had a long and I think very, very fruitful relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| We started our relationship with Knox County through the Motel Tax Fund back in the days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| when Rudy Durrell was a Knox County commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| He brought to our attention that the Kaumba Festival as an event had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| or the capacity to be a tourism drawing event for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| and in the 19 years, we've proved that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| We've been cited with the Knox County Sports and Tourism Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2753)|
| 0:46:02| on how we actually bring tourism to Knox County and the impact that has on Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| and the economic impact it has on Knox County every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| especially in the last 10 years for the Kaumba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| We brought just tons of tourist bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| People are calling me as we speak, bringing their family reunions in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| That makes me very, very happy because about 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| we did try to market the Kaumba Festival as a festival that you can come to Chill Highway Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| bring the family, bring your picnic bags, and it's always been a family affair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| So we're proud of that reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Anything that we've asked the Knox County commissioners to do in these last 19 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| you guys have been gracious enough to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| I'll only say thank you once more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| And please visit our website, KaumbaFest10.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| to continue to study our organization and the events that we sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| We're having Kaumba Camp as we speak at Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| We're having about 70 kids over there right now, just left there, running over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| just making sure that that event is going all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| We're doing that for three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| That culminates with our Kaumba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| The Kaumba Festival dates this year are June the 26th through June the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| We start at the Knox Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| We're the next day, that Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| The next day, that Friday, we're at Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| And also we're culminating with a musician and concert at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| And Saturday and Sunday on the 28th and 29th, we're at Chill Highway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| And if you have any questions, I'm more than willing to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Go ahead, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| I just have one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| We had 158, 154 applicants here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| and only about four or five people did not tell us their salaries or their top two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| What is your salary, your top two people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| It's just one person on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| That's myself right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| We have a part-time person lent to us from the Senior Aid Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| And my salary is $20,000 a year if we're able to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| I just wanted you to take maybe 15 seconds because I get this question a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| Could you explain to the commission and to the audience what Kuumba means, the term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Kuumba, spelled K-U-U-M-B-A, means creativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| It's a word that comes out of the Swahili language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| which is spoken like a common language on the eastern coast of Africa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| But we chose that name, creativity, so that we would always be pushed by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| I want to say one thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| When we first had the opportunity to have the Hotel Motel Tax as a funding source for us in the 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| it pushed us to make sure that we had heads and beds in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| so that we could justify having those monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| And then we just got in the habit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| And I just wanted to say that that was a good program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| and is a good program for us and other organizations that have events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| and or entities that can be tourism destination sites here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| And I also want to say one more thing, Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| I watch you every week or every time that you're chairing this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| You're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| I think you represent Knox County well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| I need you in my next campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2967)|

| 0:49:40| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| I'm Fiona McAnally representing the Bijou Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| I live at 7459 Huff Acre Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| The Bijou Theater, as many of you know, reopened in 2006 after a pretty tumultuous time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| We reopened with a subset of the Tennessee Theater Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| We've subsequently grown that organization as a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| And next year the Bijou Theater celebrates its 100th anniversary as a performing arts center in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| So it's a really big year for the theater and I think for the entire community of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| We appreciate the support the Knox County Commission has shown the Bijou since it reopened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| as well as the performing arts in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| I think as demonstrated by a lot of the recent press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| Knoxville is definitely getting on the map as a music city, not to use that term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| but also as a community that supports the arts and the performing arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| And a lot of times people say, oh, arts are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| They're great for the feel good, for a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| But I think most people here are starting to recognize the economic impact of a place like the Bijou or the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:51| We see our attendance growing every month, every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| And then we also partner with many of the nonprofits in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| The Bijou Theater is the location of many of the fundraisers as well as many of the performing arts groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:10| Dance, Children's Dance Ensemble, Go Contemporary Dance, the Knoxville Chamber Orchestra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| Now granted, these are all rentals and provide earned income from the Bijou,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| but because of the support of the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| we are able to keep these rental rates affordable for these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| Without continued support, we have to look for other sources of income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| and one of those is to look at our rental rates as well as our ticket prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| We really strive to keep ticket prices affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| More and more musicians and performing arts groups are not earning any income from CDs or traditional sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:49| so they make their money touring, which translates into higher touring costs for us to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| So we really strive to keep ticket prices as low as possible and still make it work financially for the Bijou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:03| Many of the restaurants around the Bijou, and I think all downtown and throughout Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| they recognize when there's a full house at the Bijou, a full house at the Tennessee, a full house at the Civic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| When there are three things going on in this town, I think people realize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Restaurants add staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Hotels see people traveling from Nashville, from Chattanooga, and from the Tri-Cities because of our theater district here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| It's just really important to understand the economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| I hope we'll have more concrete numbers in the next year or two through some studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| but the arts are important to the cultural identity of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| They're important as an economic tool, and they're important to tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| As we know, one of the few growing sectors in our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| Dr. Bill Snyder will be up next to talk about the Tennessee Theater, even though I was listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| Dr. Snyder, and it's in your book on the historical Tennessee Theater Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| I'm Bill Snyder, Director of Development and Community Relations for the Historic Tennessee Theater Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| which is a 501c3 that owns the physical property of the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| I'm pleased and honored to have an opportunity to come before you this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| and explain the rationale for why we are asking for support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| The mission of the Tennessee Theater is to preserve, maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| and operate the official state theater of Tennessee as an entertainment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| and performing arts facility and theater for the benefit and enjoyment of all Tennesseans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| and visitors to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| It's a fact nationwide that performing venues such as the Tennessee Theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| generate only 50% to 60% of the revenue needed to operate the facility from ticket sales to events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3238)|
| 0:54:07| In fact, our budget for the current fiscal year budgets 60.8% of the needed revenue coming from ticket sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:16| The balance has to come from a variety of sources such as concessions, rentals of the theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3256)|
| 0:54:25| We started last year an annual fundraising campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| We do an annual fundraising gala each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| and then contributions from a variety of sources such as individuals, corporations, foundations, and government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| such as the Knox County Community Grant Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| The renovation of the Tennessee Theater, which was completed and the theater opened in January 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| is a $28 million investment by citizens, by government, by foundations, corporations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3292)|
| 0:55:00| and Knox County government invested $6 million in the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| That's a little over 20% of the total cost of the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| The board of the foundation is adamantly committed to maintaining this theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:18| in the pristine condition that existed when it opened in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| And so our request is for support for maintenance and repairs of the theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:31| Our budget for maintenance and repairs this fiscal year is $68,000, a little over $68,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| Our request was for about $39,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| And the specific uses of these funds are documented in the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| and they include cleanup after every performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| If you ever go down State Street in the morning after a performance the night before at the theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| and see the piles of garbage cans out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| that means that somebody's been in that theater until sometimes 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning cleaning it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| and it's in immaculate condition at 8 o'clock the next morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| So custodial cleanup, monthly pest control treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| We've got a lot of pests in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| We do a semi-annual touch-up of the paint and plaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| Things get chipped and damaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| and so we bring in the team that did the original painting twice a year to do touch-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| The HVAC system needs maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| and we have to do quarterly maintenance on the security and fire alarm systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| Carpet cleaning, we clean the carpet quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| And, of course, I'm interested in maintaining the mighty Wurlitzer organ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| So these are the uses for the funds for which we request support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| Again, I thank you for the opportunity to appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| and I want to thank Knox County for all that it's done in preserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| and ensuring a future for this wonderful priceless treasure we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| Thank you, Dr. Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| Mr. Chairman, I told you before the meeting started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| I'm going to have to excuse myself now to be in a mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| but I'll be back as soon as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| You're excused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| WDX, WDVX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| Mr. Chairman, are we ever going to be able to ask these people any kind of questions later on in the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| You can if you have some short questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| We're running ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| Well, I would just like to know the amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| total amount of money that these people get from all grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| I think the ones that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| And I'd like to know the budget of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| On your presentation, if you could address this concern, we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Hi, I'm Linda Billman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| I'm representing WDVX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| My address is 3100 Germantown Lane, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| I'm representing WDVX, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| I'd like to tell you about the contributions that WDVX makes to Knox County every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| WDVX has received Knox County grants for the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| The funds help us produce the Blue Plate Special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| It's a live radio show presented each day at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| The concert is free, and if you've ever attended a Blue Plate Special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| you know that the audience is often packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Many audience members are visitors to the area, music lovers from around the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| and, indeed, around the world to experience our region's rich musical heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| and tradition of live radio performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| Since we brought the Blue Plate Special to downtown Knoxville in 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| it's grown into a signature attraction and a live music destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| It's one that caught the attention of the New York Times just last Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| In their travel section, there was an article about Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| and we were the top destination listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| Knox County funds of $25,000 for the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| paid for sound technicians, hosts, talent and program coordination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| equipment, and technical operations related to the Blue Plate Special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| We believe we've given Knox County a pretty good return on its investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| Last year, the Blue Plate Special had 20,000 attendances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| Approximately 35% of the visitors at WDVX Blue Plate Special performances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| have permanent residence outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| Those 20,000 visits, people stay at Knox County hotels, buy the food, the gifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| and other things that Knox County has to offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| as well as visiting other Knox County recreational and cultural attractions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| while they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| And that's just the in-house audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Our webcast statistics show that we have 250,000 online listeners per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| We represent Knox County to residents in every state of the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| and many foreign countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Our Blue Plate Special webcast, which is partially funded by Knox County dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| stays near capacity a majority of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| and is often maxed out during that particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| And these people are not only listening, they're visiting and telling others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| For example, we had a German TV crew in February come and tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| Our studio is located inside the Knoxville Visitor Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| which is operated by the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| And we're pleased that this well-funded organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| includes the WDVX Blue Plate Special in their efforts to attract visitors to our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| Currently, we're producing a CD of local and regional music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| performed on the Blue Plate Special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| which KTSC and other organizations are using in their promotion of the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| WDVX was recognized for its contribution to cultural tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| by the Knoxville Tourism Alliance, which awarded the Blue Plate Special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| the Museum Attraction of the Year in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| With your permission, I'd like to distribute to you articles published just this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| in the New York Times, Southern Living Magazine, and the Boston Globe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| that feature the WDVX Blue Plate Special and the music of our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| This is Tony Lawson and Bill Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| These publications sought us out, indicating the reach of WDVX's programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| These are just a few examples of the coverage that WDVX receives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| that highlight the effect that we have on the economy and the quality of life in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| Additionally, WDVX provides on-air support to the efforts of other Knox County-funded organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| such as the Ramsey House, the East Tennessee Historical Society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| Knox County Library, and the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| So really, you get a bigger bang for your buck by funding WDVX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| Despite these and other contributions to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| WDVX stands to receive nothing in the 2009 budget from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| This year in its evaluation process, the Citizens Review Panel recommended that WDVX receive $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| This is an increase over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| However, as funds were being distributed, the pool of money ran out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| before WDVX and many other worthy organizations could be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| It doesn't make sense that the committee should be placed in the position of recommending increased funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| but awarding nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Because similar recommendations occurred all across panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| there seems to be a shortcoming in the process, not in the efforts of the panel members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| The commission has the opportunity to correct the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| while preserving the integrity of the work of the panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| We ask that you consider the many contributions that WDVX makes daily to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| especially its impact on tourism and the quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| We believe the Citizens Review Panel is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| provided that the panelists are given the information and processes they need to do their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| Please reconsider reinstating the $250,000 reduction in funding for culture and tourism grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| Because sources of replacement funding are very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| the loss of that amount of money to those organizations will seriously harm many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| If funding cannot be restored to previous levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| please consider remanding to the Citizens Review Panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| the task of proportionally distributing the limited funds to all of the organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| that it recommended receive money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| I appreciate every bit of support you've given us in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Knoxville Symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:25| Oh, he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Tennessee Valley Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:45| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| I'm Scott Sahumski, the Executive Director for the Tennessee Valley Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| My address is 7920 Oak Ridge Highway in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| First and foremost, I'd like to thank you for the continued support that you've given to the Tennessee Valley Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| I've got a handout, and I'll give it to you after I finish my briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| The Tennessee Valley Fair, as we know, was born in 1916| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| with the mission to bring agricultural awareness and education to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| For 89 years, the Tennessee Valley Fair has been committed to educating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| and promoting rich agricultural traditions and history of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| If you do your simple math, you'll say, well, that's not 89 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| Well, the Tennessee Valley Fair took a couple years break from World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| and actually on our history books, there was about a two-year span| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| in which they did not have a fair due to epidemic scare in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| So as you can see, Knoxville, the Tennessee Valley Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| is probably one of the longer-running nonprofits here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| As Knox County continues to grow as a metropolitan center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| the local farms that were once so relevant are moving away and declining in numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| Today, many of our children are unaware as to where everyday household items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| such as milk, eggs, cheese, wool, and ice cream come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| More often than not, the Tennessee Valley Fair is the only exposure to the farming industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| many of our children will experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| The Tennessee Valley Fair has applied for several grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| and our categories cover anything from Senior Citizens Day at the fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| to educational programs such as Down on the Farm Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| in which we invite all Knox County grade school kids to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| and experience the fair on Tuesday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| When you think about the Tennessee Valley Fair, you start thinking about tradition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| family memories, and even an institution in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Most Knoxvillians are well aware of the Tennessee Valley Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| and I would guess that most individuals here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| have attended the fair in one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| Many of our volunteers are generation after generation of volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| grandparents, grandchildren, that continue to pass the tradition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| of assisting in a great community event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| The Tennessee Valley Fair is truly something for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| It is probably the one event in Knoxville where every walk of life is represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| and an activity for almost every walk of life is presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| We have everything from tractor pulls to action sports arena, theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| rodeo, headlining concerts at the Homer Hamilton Theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| as well as livestock shows and other community events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| As I mentioned, our grants range anywhere from Senior Citizens Day at the fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| to many educational programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| Just this past year, we applied for over $35,000 in grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| and we were only funded $3,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Funds like this are important to the Tennessee Valley Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Most of the funds go directly right back into the program that they support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| Without these funds, we cannot introduce new programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| such as we did last year with the Live Birthing Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| or we can continue to improve other programs, such as Down on the Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| And short of it all, we only received 10% of what we had asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| Again, as I mentioned, the funding allows us to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| and continue to add new activities that are usually enjoyed and accepted by everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| Once again, on behalf of the Tennessee Valley Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| I'd like to thank you for your continued funding and your support of a great institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| The whole committee process has been a very interesting one, to say the least for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| and we do support the Citizen Review Panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| However, we do feel that certain changes should be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| and that some of the folks that attend it should become more objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| as far as what they're looking at as far as the programs that we offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| as well as education as far as our specific programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| Once again, thank you very much, and I will pass out these handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| Thank you, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| Mark, we have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| No, I don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| I just wanted to alert you that Mr. Mamentoff just showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| Yeah, I saw him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| Mark, Knoxville Symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:56| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| I thought it was at 940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Did it run early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| I'm very sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| My name is Mark Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| I'm in my role here today as the immediate past president of the Knoxville Symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| I've also been on the board of the symphony for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I'm sorry, our executive director is out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| and that's why I'm here today as well as our music director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| I want to thank the commission for the prior funding that you've given the symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| We're very grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| This funding has allowed us to continue our educational and community-oriented work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| that benefits thousands of residents and school children in Knox County each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| The Knoxville Symphony applied for $50,000 for this upcoming fiscal year from Knox County funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| as we have in prior fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| Previous Knox County grant awards of roughly $25,000 have supported numerous symphony education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4182)|

| 1:10:30| in 15 Knox County library performances each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4230)|

| 1:10:42| Our music and wellness program, where we go into hospitals and oncology centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| and play music to help with patients, has generated national attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| and impacts over 2,000 Knox County residents in area health care facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| And our free community concerts have reached over 25,000 people this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| in public venues like Westtown Mall, Knoxville Center, Victor Ash Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| Concord Park, World's Fair Park, and Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| The symphony provides educational programs, which over 12,000 Knox County students enjoy each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| We are a draw for economic development and tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| as over 200,000 patrons attend our concerts each season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| patrons who come from Knox County and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| We attract from all over East Tennessee, staying in our hotels and eating in our restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| We help stimulate the local economy as we employ nearly 100 musicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| and administrative staff members in Knox County who make Knoxville their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| pay taxes, and educate their families in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| We are very, very grateful for the support that Knox County has given us in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| It makes a huge difference to the symphony and, as a result, a huge difference in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| I personally have spent an inordinate amount of time helping the symphony be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| and we're very proud of what we've accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| and we hope that we will continue to deserve your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Thank you, Chairman Tricklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Yeah, I'd just like to recognize we have some mothers here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| that came out to support the Helen Ross McNabb Mother Goose Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| They weren't here during the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| but I just wanted to recognize these folks in the back that they are here to support the Mother Goose Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:30| Would one of you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:42| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| Come on down, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| My name is Tara Goodman, and I'm a first-time mother, and this is TJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| And we attend the program at the East Town Mall location regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| And I just wanted to say that this is, you know, they called last night and said that this was up for budget cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| And you can see by all the support that's here, these aren't just the only people that come every week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| but this is something that helps our children get a good head start before they even go into preschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:25| Some of them aren't even old enough to do preschool programs yet, but it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| They have brain-building activities each week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| They do games, stories, all kinds of things that help us interact with our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| and learn how to do these things better, especially as first-time mothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| And the program being a free program is great for those of us who aren't working right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| I changed careers and went back to school to get my teaching certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| So while I was pregnant, I was not making any money, as you do as a student teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| So this program, being one of the only ones that doesn't charge you anything, is great for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:11| as is, I'm sure, many families that want to stay home with their children and only have one income in the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| So we just wanted to show our support today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| And I'm sure other people feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| I need your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| Address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| 8629 Rayworth Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| And thank you for coming, all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| Senior Citizen Home Assistance Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:55| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| That's a hard act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| My name is Ludell Coffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| I'm the CEO at Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| And our agency has been serving seniors in our community since 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| And it's been my privilege to be there for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| Our mission is to improve the quality of life of the seniors and those with disabilities that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:26| And just last month, in the month of May, we provided over 7,000 hours of service to about 400 clients in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:38| The Knox County funding, and we fared well in the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| I'm not here to protest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| But the Knox County funding is used to help the people who can pay part of their care but not all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| and don't meet the government regulations for those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| So it's real important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| But it also matches some of the state funding to allow us to help more people who are truly unable to have care any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:09| So I thank Knox County for the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| Knox County has been our partner since the beginning of the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| And we are so pleased and proud to claim them as partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4577)|
| 1:16:24| Our budget for the coming year that will be voted on this month by our board is over $4,600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:33| And so it has grown enormously since 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| In 1978, when I got there, our budget was $125,000, just for comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:47| Our money comes from the state of Tennessee, which we got no money when I first started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| but it's now become the biggest player in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| And we have the Medicaid waiver program, which has helped so many people stay at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| who could not otherwise would have to go into a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| That's a big player, and it's a new player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| But the city of Knoxville is also a funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| We're in 14 counties now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| We started here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| It's still our biggest program by far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| But we have 11 United Ways that support us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| We have local governments across our region who support us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| And I want to take just a couple of minutes to tell you about a new project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| that Knox County has also been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| Tim Howell, our chief finance officer, has been passing around some pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| and some other information about our new project, the Renaissance Terrace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| which will not only house our home office, all the administrative offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| and the training facility, but it will have 48 units of affordable assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| It will open in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Knox County was our first big funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| The state of Tennessee has contributed and already paid $3 million on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| It's a $9 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| We had almost 300 individuals who have contributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| One lady sends us $25 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| She's now contributed well over $500 at $25 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| And we have people who contributed thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| It's just all over the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| Fourteen corporations, 16 foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| I'm sorry, Mr. Pinkston, I can't give you the total dollar amount on which each one has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| But it's a very broad-based support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| We've been working on this campaign for several years, and it's about to open in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:58| And we appreciate so much Knox County's support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| This will be the only program in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| In fact, the governor is so pleased with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| that he wants us to help them do this across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| so that people can afford to go into this assisted living type facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| and pay for the care and the maintenance once the facility is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| and paid for with the donations and the grants that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| So it's not an easy way to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| The easy way is to borrow the money and pay it back and pay interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| But if you do that, you have to charge so much it puts it out of the range of most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| So that's why we've done it the hard way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| And we thank you for your help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| And we're always glad to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| I know there are some people on this group that probably have never heard of us before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| And so we're really pleased to have this opportunity always to share information about what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| And it's basically a homemaker program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| It's not medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| And it's what people need as they get older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| Help with getting a meal, getting groceries in, getting medicine, reminding to take medicines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:17| helping with a bath, helping get from the bed to a wheelchair in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:25| And so it really is improving the lives of our senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| And I thank you so much for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| And I'll be glad to try to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Yes, I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| And first of all, with the type of work that I do, I realize how important it is to the seniors which you provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| It's just one of those services that makes a tremendous amount of difference as folks start to get older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| and can't quite take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| So we really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| And I know they do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I notice if you looked at the budget last year, you received about $70,000 from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| And when you add it together this year, the increase is, I think, about $328,000 over what last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| What is the new program that's going to be used to pay for those additional dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| Just what's different this year than what it was last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| I'm sure that is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Actually, our homemaker program took a cut from $70,000 to $64,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| So there's no increase for that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| The $330,000 is for the Renaissance Terrace for this capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| When this project is completed, then we won't be coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| That was the whole idea, to have it where people could afford it, and it would be maintained in itself in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| So thank you so much for allowing me to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| Yes, I thought that might be the case, but I just wanted to get that clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Thank you very much for your good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Any other questions or any other nice comments like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:23| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| I'm David Watson, Executive Director of the East Tennessee Community Design Center, 1300 North Broadway, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:35| Thanks to Dr. Briggs and his skills about ten years ago, I'm able to be here this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| Good to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| In a better light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| We are one of the applicants that received a large portion of our application request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| Actually, the panel recommended 78% of our request, a little over $19,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| And our total budget is $264,694, or the panel recommended 7.5% of our total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:09| The Community Design Center is a legal not-for-profit 501C3 organization that's operated in Knox County for 38 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:18| providing low-to-no-cost design and technical assistance to organizations that are not able to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| or receive the needed service without our assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| We do not serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| We serve organizations that serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| And many of those organizations have been in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| We have always included all required documents for our grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| and, again, during the year for reporting our activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| But that's not why I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| I'm here today to discuss a review panel process and actions under considerations by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| Attempting to rationalize recommendations of any funding source to greatly reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| or fully eliminate funding to a legitimate cause without adequate warning is a mind-boggling situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:09| Not-for-profit organizations provide services that cannot be or are not provided by anyone else, including the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:17| And they provide these services at a cost less than anyone else could provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| If this body decides to eliminate community grants altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| that's even more boggling than some of the panel recommendations, not necessarily unwarranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| However, please save that decision for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| Most everyone in this room is or has at one time been in a business management position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| trying to match an underfunded budget to production of a product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| be that product physical or a human social product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| I would like to offer that in this very difficult time of attempting to define the roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| and the responsibilities of all parties involved, the legislative and executive branches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| the city citizen volunteers, and the nonprofit groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| that you consider the difficulty of the tasks, criteria, and guidelines given to an all-volunteer assembly of willing citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:19| who I believe perform with the highest of integrity and the best faith efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| And I applaud their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| I commend the volunteer review panels and Knox County Community Development for their dedication and hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5126)|
| 1:25:34| I'd like to take this opportunity to consider a less destructive ramification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| such as an alternative idea to both scenarios mentioned above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| Consider for the grantees that successfully completed the application and the reporting process last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| reducing their grant award by the same percentage as the grant budget is reduced for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:59| If you or the review panel decide to make more drastic reductions, such as a massive or total funding reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| please do it next year, giving fair warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| Many of us begin our fiscal year in less than three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| Do we need to go back and slice jobs and programs today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Settle this issue quickly in favor of the organizations that comply with county requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| and then work on the process, but only if the newly derived process is truly broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:48| Keep in mind that all applicants that we want your budget and other grants that you're getting figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5208)|
| 1:26:58| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| I'm Sandra Gammon, Director of Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| Ramsey House is located at 2614 Thorn Grove Pike, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| I've given Mr. Pinkston and Mr. McKenzie a couple of handouts that I would ask you to pass down while I'm speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| I wouldn't want you to be looking at anything else while other people are up here speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| so if you don't mind to pass those along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| First of all, I'd like to thank the commission for the funding they've given us in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| With those funds, Ramsey House has been able to enhance its educational programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| and the number of student visits more than doubled this year as opposed to the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| We are proud to be a learning expedition facility for Beaumont Schools' museum program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| which means that part of Beaumont's curriculum involves outside-the-classroom learning expeditions to Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:56| Additionally, Ramsey House has been able to increase its overall tourism activities due to greater marketing ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| which in turn contributes to the overall economy in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| I wanted to point out that more than half of our annual visitors are from out-of-state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| and not only Ramsey House but the other museums and arts organizations in Knoxville are a big draw to those people from out-of-town and from out-of-state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:27| Obviously, I'm not here to ask for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| I appreciate the allotment that the community panel has given us this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| and I want to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| The funds we receive, if that be the case, will be used to further enhance our educational programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| and to continue building our Heritage Seed program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| which has become instrumental in instructing students on the importance of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| We will also use funds to assist in the restoration of a part of the historic home that has never been used for tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| In order to offer the historical interpretation of the African American experience at Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:12| Additionally, funds that we will receive will go into maintenance of the historic building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:19| in order to continue educating the public about the significance of the architecture and of the Ramsey family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| to the founding and development of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| I might remind you that out of the Ramsey family came the first railroad, the first steamboat in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:38| the first bank, the first doctor, the first hospital, and the first written history of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:47| Finally, I would like to encourage the commission to give much consideration to the future process by which these grants are awarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:56| so that the non-profits which bring revenue to this community by advancing cultural tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| can continue to provide our invaluable services and continue to put dollars back into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:11| I believe you wanted budget information. I don't have the figures in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| but I think our annual budget is a little over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| We do have a couple of major fundraisers we do during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| YWCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:43| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| My name is Mary Gail Mullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| I'm Executive Director of the YWCA in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| I appreciate the opportunity to come and speak to you today, particularly because I'm new to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| I've met some of you, but not all of you, so I welcome the opportunity to introduce myself to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| and to also introduce you to Kelvin Cash, who is the Director of our Phyllis Wheatley Branch in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:12| The YWCA has been a part of the Knoxville community since 1899.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| The downtown branch is your neighbor right over here on the corner of Clinch and Walnut Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| We are a social service organization providing counseling and services to families in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:31| We requested funding this year in two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| We have been grateful for all the previous funding that we have gotten through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| We were one of the agencies that did receive funding, were recommended for funding from the panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:49| and we are grateful for the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| We're not here today to ask for any increased funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| I would like to say, though, that the funding that had been recommended was for a victim advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5516)|
| 1:32:03| Some of you may be down here on Thursdays and see the real huge amounts of crowds of people on Thursdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:13| who are waiting to get into courtrooms to get orders of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| Our victim advocates employed by the YWCA help the victims of domestic violence through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:27| through the court process, and also through safety planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| which is tremendously important because, as we know, these families are in significant danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| There were four deaths last year in our county due to domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| In addition, we offer support groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| We believe that this really makes the difference in helping assure that someone does not stay in a violent situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:58| Sixty-eight percent of those who attend our support groups leave their abuser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| That's compared with a national figure of 18 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| So we are having very significant success here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| And without the funding from this grant, we would not be able to continue to provide these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5593)|
| 1:33:21| We also requested funding in the senior area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| And this is for a program for senior citizens that's offered at the Phyllis Wheatley Branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:33| These senior citizens have been longtime contributors to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| They are isolated and alone, and without this program, wouldn't be able to leave their house very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:46| They're able to come to the Phyllis Wheatley Center and participate in activities, participate in exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| participate in educational programming, play games, socialize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| It enriches their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| In both of these programs, we do outcome studies to assure that what we're doing is the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| to assure that what we're doing is making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| And in both of these programs, we are measuring the significance of the impact at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| And I want to assure you of that because I think it's important that we offer programs that really are making a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| not just programs that we think might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| We are very grateful for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| I want to thank the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I want to thank the panels and community development for hanging in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| And we encourage you to hang in there in the future through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| We know that you have received some compliments and some criticisms as a result of this change in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:49| But I want to assure you that your efforts and hard work and the time you are expending is worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:57| Because the impact of this funding on services and programs and families in this community is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5697)|
| 1:35:06| And particularly for the YWCA, we are assuring through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| or helping to assure that women and children are safe, free from violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| that senior citizens are able to enjoy a pleasant and wholesome and happy life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:28| And so we are saving lives in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| So I want to encourage you that it is very much worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| Our annual budget is $1,368,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| The amount of grant support for our victim advocacy program is $145,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| That includes funding from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| And the amount of grant funding for the senior program is zero without this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| Yes, we have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Do you partner with the Family Justice Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Yes, we are an original partner with the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| In fact, we have the most advocates there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| We're serving about YWCA through the advocacy center alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| We're having over 12,000 contacts a year for victims of domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| So we're one of the original partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| We have probably the largest presence at Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5795)|

| 1:36:38| Blunt Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5798)|
| 1:36:46| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| My name is Billy Chabot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| I'm the Executive Director of Blunt Mansion, 200 West Till Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:57| Blunt Mansion was built 216 years ago in 1792.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5817)|
| 1:37:03| In 1926, it opened as Knoxville's first museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| Therefore, it is Knoxville's oldest museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| Today, Blunt Mansion attracts about 12,000 visitors a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| and about 2,500 of those visitors are Knox County school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| Lots of folks in this community tell me that they fondly remember trips to Blunt Mansion as a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| and I'm sure many of you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| Lots of Knox County teachers consider a field trip to Blunt Mansion a must-see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| when talking about East Tennessee history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| Blunt Mansion is also an important cultural heritage destination site for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| We attract many out-of-town tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| And I want to remind you today that Blunt Mansion is one of only a handful of national historic landmarks in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| There are only 26 national historic landmarks in the state of Tennessee, and Blunt Mansion is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| It is truly a treasure for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| Blunt Mansion was lucky enough to receive recommendation from the community panel to receive funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:11| So as many have said today, I'm not here asking for extra funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| but I just want to tell you a little bit about what this funding does for Blunt Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| It supports our internship program, which allows us to deliver educational programs that we wouldn't be otherwise able to deliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:28| It also is a training field for upcoming museum professionals that we hope stay in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| and have an economic impact on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| Through such programs, we're able to demonstrate to our members, to our patrons, and our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| our commitment to take care of the Blunt Mansion collections and to provide quality educational programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| Many, many of our educational programs are offered to this community at no charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| We frequently have family days on Saturday where we invite the community in for free educational programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| We have one coming up this Saturday, which is Flag Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| and we work with the Girl Scouts to do a flag-raising ceremony and give a history of the United States flag program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| All free to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Also, I want to touch a bit on accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| Blunt Mansion has been receiving community grant funding for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| and we're one of the organizations that attends all the meetings, that turns all the reports in in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| complies with everything we need to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| We've dotted every I and crossed every T in this process year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| We are a non-profit organization our community can truly be proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| and we look forward to your continued support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| And finally, today I just want to say that I stand here today in solidarity with all the historic sites that have presented here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:50| with Ramsey House, with James White Fort, with Blunt Mansion, and with Marble Springs, which will be coming up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:59| Last fall we formed a partnership to work together, Historic Homes of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| and we've been providing services and working together to share resources to promote the heritage and culture of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:12| We've been working with KTSC, and our historic sites are one of the reasons that we are able to attract such large conventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:20| such as the upcoming Quilters Convention and the Genealogy Convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| Those folks are looking for cultural heritage sites to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| We will attract tens of thousands of visitors to our community, which means millions of dollars in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| So I look forward to your support, and I'll answer any questions that you have about budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| or what other kinds of grant money that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| Our budget this year is just under $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| Our request for the community grant represented 7.5 percent of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:56| And last year, last fiscal year, we received about $31,000 total in grant money, all for projects, not for operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6056)|
| 1:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| Red Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:21| Hi. My name is Katie Hutchison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| I'm the director of the Community Volunteer Services Program at the Knoxville area chapter of the American Red Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| Our address is 6921 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| I wanted to start out just saying thank you for the support that we've received from the county in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| I'm speaking specifically on behalf of our inner city school health clinic program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| Since 1966, our chapter has run school health clinics in Knox County using trained Red Cross volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:55| usually parents that want to volunteer in their child's school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| We provide care and attention to sick and injured school children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| especially in a time where in a lot of our schools they might not have a full-time school nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| They might have a nurse that's rotating between several schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| It's really vital to have volunteers there that might be able to care for a child who could be a fall on a playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| could be a broken bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| The structure in our inner city program is a little bit different than in other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| Typically, other schools we have the PTAs that can provide some support to us to run a school health clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| In our inner city schools, which these funds would go towards, we don't typically have that support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| and that's where we really rely on the county funds to help us stock our clinics with supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| Funds from this grant are used in conjunction with a special partnership that we have with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| There's a campus organization very appropriately called UT Clinic Vols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| and they use pre-med and nursing students to staff our inner city clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| because typically in the schools that we're working in, they don't have the parental base to serve as volunteers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6185)|
| 1:43:12| Funds from the grants have been consistently used over the last several years to stock our clinics with supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| that the parent volunteers or the PTAs are usually providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| In this way, we're really able to leverage county funds to provide the best care to children in our inner city clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| In the past, we've used funds at South Knox Elementary, Beaumont Elementary, Green Magnet, Inskip, Dogwood Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:37| and most recently, as of January, we've started the clinic at Lonsdale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| Last year, just to give you an idea of what we do in our clinics, we provided over 10,000 services to inner city school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| If you break this number down, we find that each inner city clinic on average provides about 13 services a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:58| In some cases, this could just mean taking a temperature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| In other cases, putting on a Band-Aid, ice pack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| Some cases, this is just providing a quiet place for a child to wait until a parent or guardian can come pick them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| instead of having to sit in the office with busy secretaries or go back to the classroom if the school nurse isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:19| Of course, we have had cases where it's splitting a broken bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| Our volunteers are trained to recognize signs and symptoms of more serious illness, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| So we have had times where we've had a concussion, seizure, signs of shock, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:35| Our clinic services just simply cannot be provided without the day-to-day supplies such as digital ear thermometers, ice packs, disinfectant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:44| We even keep a closed closet for children that have some kind of accident throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:52| Funds from this grant will not only be used to maintain the supplies in the inner city clinics that we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| but also to enable us to stock and supply at least two, we're hoping for four, new clinics and schools that have greater need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6297)|
| 1:45:08| These funds could be used to buy refrigerators, ice packs, so we can keep the ice packs right in the clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| instead of having to go down to the hall to another room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| And then also just purchasing bulletin boards to display policies, information, so our volunteers are always kept up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:25| Funds from this grant are just instrumental in keeping our clinic doors open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| and we hope that continued funding and support from the county will enable us to expand our reach into more areas of lower need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:37| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| The chapter operates on a $1.4 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| About 50% of this we do receive from United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:53| I don't see your grant proposal in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| Do you have it under another name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| It's called Inner City Clinic Supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| American Red Cross is the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| Oh, American Red Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| That's one, but the CPR Saturday, I haven't been able to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| Chairman, can I ask a question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| Katie, I just wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| I know that you guys do a phenomenal job, and I just want to say thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| One of the things I wanted to ask you was I know that at UT there is a grant available for school supplies, for clinic supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:34| Have you all investigated that at all, or are you aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| I'm not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Can I get with you later and talk to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| Because I had recommended it to the school system to apply for that grant as well, and it's specifically there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:48| I believe they dispersed their funds out in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| but their due date as to when they have to have grant applications is probably pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| So I'd like to talk to you about that and make sure that you can at least try there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Mr. Johnson, American Red Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| No, I haven't found this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| Have you found that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| Oh, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| My name is Jim Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| I'm the Director of Health and Safety Services for the American Red Cross in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| We're at 6921 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| First of all, I'd like to say thanks for the panel that had considered our original request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| and I also want to say thanks for the commission for allowing us to present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| I'm having some handouts passed around, but I'll go ahead and get started with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| Our request, we actually had two, but I'm going to talk about the first aid station team first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| The first aid station team was first put in place in the 1930s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| and we provided first aid service at lots of different community events, sporting events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:54| entertainment events, and fundraising charity events around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| The stations are staffed with highly trained Red Cross volunteers that know what to do and when to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| They provide immediate and temporary care for injuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| and sudden illness before the arrival of EMS personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| And why that's so important is because there could be a lot more serious injury or illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| if we're not there to provide that because most events do not have EMS on site, so they have to invoke EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:26| It could be wounds, strokes, allergic reactions, cardiac care such as CPR and AED intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| We've actually had some people have had AEDs used on them and been able to actually survive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| and that's really a success story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| On an annual basis, about a million people are protected at these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| We actually treated last year 228 folks, with a small number actually transported to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:55| The last one was one at the Habitat for Humanity building blitz where a fellow split his head open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| We was able to stop the bleeding, but we sent him on to the hospital in the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| We provide about 4,960 volunteer hours per year, and 1,814 of those that we plan to provide at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:15| And I'll tell you how we'll do that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| And that's basically because of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| What we've done in place in the last little bit actually is really negotiated rates with venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:31| and events that can afford to pay us, that make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| The problem is it leaves out all the other ones that can't afford to do that, the charitable events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| the things that happen in Knox County that just basically can't afford to pay for the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:47| That 1,814 hours represent about $34,000 in current volunteer time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| and another $14,000 in equipment and supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| So the grant we're seeking actually will be leveraged about four to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| which I think is a great return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| First aid stations are also used at smaller events to avoid overburdening the EMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| If somebody gets hurt at an event, basically they have a couple of choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| They can go to a hospital, walk-in clinic, or if EMS is invoked, then they are taken in an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| But in many cases, we can treat that person and there's no additional cost to them or the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6618)|
| 1:50:26| One of the things about this, we have never had outside funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| We've always been able to provide this over the last 75 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| We just can't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| So we've gone out and actually negotiated with some of the venues to pay for that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| What we're talking about here is the folks that can't afford to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| Because if we don't get the funding, we won't be able to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| The actual total program income is going from zero in our line item income budget to about $85,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| And as you can see, most of that will be paid with fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| And Noss County Grant would give us the seed money to put the program in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| continue the program for the ones that can't afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| and allow us to get sponsorships during the next year to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| So our anticipation is that we only come to Noss County one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| This is the first time and hopefully the last time we would have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| On the second page, I'm going to briefly mention the CPR project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| That was one that did not make the cut in the original analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| but it's a program where we provide free CPR Saturday to underfunded communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| And we really think that's a valuable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| I'm not going to go through those things, but I want you to see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| Those are very important things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| And hopefully we'll be able to get funding for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| We're going to take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| That's it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=6715)|

| 2:00:09| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| You might want to wait a couple of minutes. We'll round everybody up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7212)|
| 2:00:20| I think herding cats is easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| Could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| My name is Kate O'Day. I'm the president and CEO of Child and Family Tennessee. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| address is 901| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7234)|

| 2:01:07| I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak with each of you today. Child and Family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:17| Tennessee was started in 1929. We were started by area churches as a service to unwed mothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| Back in those days it was recognized that there were families struggling and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| the original mission of Child and Family Tennessee and it's still our mission today. We use evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| based practices. We look for research tested interventions and we do track our outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| so that we can tell you how effective our services are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| The aid program, we have about 35 total programs, about a six and a half million dollar budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| and we do work in Knox, Blount and the surrounding counties. So we're kind of a regional organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| but we are based in Knoxville and our history is in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| The aid programs funded through the Knox County Community Grants Program are excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| examples of some of our services. We offer safety net services for struggling families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| and children and some of our services aren't duplicated anywhere else. On the social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| panel we had connections, which is our intensive in-home service, which helps about 185 at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| risk children each year remain safely at home with their families. We have our family crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| center, which is Knox County's only comprehensive domestic violence service center. It includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:32| shelter 24-7, a hotline that's open 24-7, 365 days a year. Counseling, children's services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:41| this is all at no cost to any of the clients who need those services. And we also do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| 24-hour phone line when the Family Justice Center closes their doors for the day. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:52| phone calls roll over to us at Child and Family. As the only Knox County shelter that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| specializes and only serves abuse victims, over 200 women and children each year are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| helped through the service. Another program we have is Partners for Child Abuse Prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| which is parenting education for parents who are at risk to abuse their children and workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:15| for new dads. We have a boot camp for new dads that helps dads get off to a strong start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| with parenting their kids. That helps 250 parents with 500 children every year. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:26| Pleasant Tree Apartments were the county's first permanent housing for mentally ill women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| and their children. We house 24 mentally ill and formerly homeless women with their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| And this is the model that is called for in the 10-year plan to end homelessness. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| we have the PACE Act program, which is the Project Against the Sexual Abuse of Appalachian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| Children. Back in the middle 70s, before we really weren't even discussing the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| children were sexually abused, Child and Family pioneered this specialized service. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| work with more than 200 victims of sexual abuse each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| On the youth panel is our foster care program, which connects state custody youth and gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| them living in family settings. That saves between $20,000 and $81,000 per child per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7448)|
| 2:04:16| year. So we served 17 youth last year. So conservatively we saved $340,000 in expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:24| on those kids who would otherwise have been in more expensive settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| Our Kids on the Block program offers puppet shows with key messages for children using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| tested and researched scripts. This is a national program that we brought to Knoxville some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| years ago. We see almost 9,000 Knox County children elementary school age every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:45| We do a program on safe touches and that abuse is not okay. And four children in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| did disclose to us that they were abused through our puppet shows last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| And finally, our Runaway Shelter is the only program of its kind in East Tennessee. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| is a 365-day-a-year, 24-7 facility. We're there for kids who have made a bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| You don't want them to have a worse outcome than that. We actually do a lot of free counseling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| a lot of preventing runaways from occurring in the first place. So we sheltered 136 youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7513)|
| 2:05:20| at the Runaway Shelter and prevented 169 youth from running away last year at that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| Some of you know us. You've seen us at the United Way. We enjoy a lot of support from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| the United Way. We're very confident in the impact that we're making in Knox County. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| know our services are focused. We know they're needed and we know they're not duplicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:41| Our Knox County grant funds are very wisely invested with us, and I think we have a unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| story to tell about this. The eight programs that you fund through the Community Grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| Program have 12 federal grants that are associated with them. And with the Knox County grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:56| funding, for every dollar that you give us, we're able to leverage six more dollars on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| average in federal funding. So the reduction in funding that we've gotten has put some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| of those funds at risk because federal grants never want to fund 100 percent of the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| that they bring. And federal grants, by the way, in case you're not familiar with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| are nationally put out. You compete on a national level. If we win those grants, that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| comes to Knox County. If we don't win the grants, the money goes to some other community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| It's not that the money's allocated to Knox. We bring that money in by successfully competing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| for those grants. So we were pleased to see that there was more scrutiny and more interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| this year, that more people were involved, because we welcome the opportunity to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| more people about what we're doing. And we want to express our appreciation to the volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| panel members, because they really approached it with a lot of integrity, with sincerity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:53| I think that people were really trying to make the process better, and we really applaud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| those efforts. But we need you to know that we had, in spite of the fact that we did very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:05| well on our scores, and all of our, eight of our written applications were scored well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| Our five programs in the social services panel scored in the top eight, and our three programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| in the youth panel scored in the top ten. So we're very happy with that. But because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| we took a conservative approach and did not ask for a whole lot more money, we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| ended up with only 88 percent of the grant funding that we applied for this year. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| this is a serious consequence for us. We think that we exemplify a lot of what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7649)|
| 2:07:35| looking for, and yet we had a negative outcome. And that puts about $69,000 of those federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:42| matching funds at risk if we don't find another source for those matching funds, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7662)|
| 2:07:49| we will have to cut back the services in each of these programs in order to be fiscally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| responsible. If we don't have the money, we have to do fewer services. And I can enumerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| those for you, and I can get the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7678)|

| 2:08:28| and, as Mr. Strickland says, I'm a transplant surgeon, vascular surgeon, but I'm not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| to talk about that. I want to recruit patients, our donors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7712)|

| 2:08:40| I can get Dr. Briggs to help me, too. But the real reason I'm here is to promote a novel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:49| program that started, actually, at West High School about 15 years ago, a young lady named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| Brooks Davis, after I gave one of those career day talks that we're all asked to give, came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7734)|
| 2:09:00| up to me afterwards and said, would you be my mentor? And I said, sure, figuring I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| have to do a report or something. And she called me three weeks later and said, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| ready. And I said, what do you mean, we're ready, Brooks? She said, we want to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7750)|
| 2:09:13| about medicine. We're high school juniors. And I said, that's ridiculous. You're too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| young. HIPAA, well, it wasn't HIPAA then, but something akin to HIPAA. You'll get squirted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| with blood, whatever. And hung up and said, I'll think about it. And about 20 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| later said, what a wonderful idea, to get kids interested early on in medical careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:37| That program started with six kids. One of the early things we decided was I would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| out and beat the bushes to get some money to pay stipends for the kids, because most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| of these kids would have to earn money during the summer. And we didn't want to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| all doctor's kids, who could afford not to. We started out with a winter program. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| attend seminars during the winter, learn about some of the mechanics of medical care. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| then the summer program is six weeks long. It is an intensive, all-day program for kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7805)|
| 2:10:12| who are high school juniors, seniors, and some college kids. We give priority to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:20| high school kids, because there are programs out there for shadowing, for kids who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| already interested in medical careers. This is for young adults, I should say, who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| interested in pursuing a variety of medical careers. Pharmacy, nursing, medicine, dieticians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:39| wherever there's an interest, we try to arrange a rotation. During the six weeks, they rotate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| on six different services. They become an integral member of the team, in a way. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:51| you were a patient, you probably wouldn't know who the explorer was and who the, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| you'd hope you'd know who the surgeon was, but maybe not. Some of my residents look awful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| young. And they rotate with us. They rotate with the nursing service, with the pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:11| They basically learn, help decide whether or not they want to pursue a medical career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| in college and beyond. Our funding comes from volunteers. Physicians make a good part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7877)|
| 2:11:25| the funding. I beat the bushes for various foundations to come up here and there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| I spend probably a good deal of time from November through right now trying to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7890)|
| 2:11:38| money for the kids. The faculty are all volunteer physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7898)|
| 2:11:46| a wonderful, wonderful thing, if you think of all the doctors who are involved to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| this, because it's grown from six to 50 kids. We had close to 100 applicants this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7910)|
| 2:11:58| We had to cut out most of the college kids, again, because we felt that there were venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| for them to shadow, and we're more interested in attracting children from the county into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| medical professions than we are trying to help them get into medical school, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| another role that I have. So this is more trying to increase the number of people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7934)|
| 2:12:22| the county who would be interested in a medical career and go on and do the things that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| need to do in college to get to where they want to go. They get my lecture, which starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7948)|
| 2:12:34| off with there's no substitute for straight A's, and goes on after that to how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7954)|
| 2:12:42| how to get into nursing school, how to get into medical school, what you need to do in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7962)|
| 2:12:47| order to do it. We talk about malpractice. There's a six-week course, hour and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| lecture series or seminar series on medical ethics issues in medicine, and they all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| to do at least one oral and written report on a subject in the area that they're interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7978)|
| 2:13:07| in. So it's a very intensive, all-day experience. They also, and if any of you have kids, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| do this for them anyway, I make them spend 24 hours on with the trauma team. If they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=7993)|
| 2:13:20| drink and drive or get in a car with somebody who's drinking and driving after that, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| need to get them help, because my whole purpose there is to show what the effects of substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8005)|
| 2:13:33| abuse and driving can be, and it's a real eye-opening experience for a lot of the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8013)|
| 2:13:39| I'll be happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| Thank you, Dr. Goldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Dr. Goldman, over here. I know your resources may be stressed, but if you can find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:52| to coordinate with the McNair Scholars Program, because there are some persons there who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8032)|
| 2:13:57| interested in graduate education in medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| Yes. This thing has just gone asymptotic in growth, and in people who are interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8040)|
| 2:14:07| interacting with us now. There are actually two new programs, one in Chattanooga and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| in Johnson City in medical explorations, and we're trying to integrate with a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| the programs that UT has for underprivileged kids to try to arrange for them to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8056)|
| 2:14:21| as well. So you're right. There are a lot of things that we can interact with, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| really finding the funding. We've got the volunteers. Believe me, the docs are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8066)|
| 2:14:32| The one thing I'm proud of my profession on is the number of folks who stepped up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| said, sure, we'll take somebody into my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| Thank you. UT Medical Center, Healing Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8081)|
| 2:14:55| Good morning. My name is Renee Hawk, and I'm one of the vice presidents at UT Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| and I thank you for the time today to talk about our grant funding request for the Healing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| Garden. As you all know, the medical center has been in existence since 1956, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:11| been serving patients and families from Knox County during that time. We see about 65,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:18| to 70,000 admissions per year, and about 70% of those are from the Knox County area. While| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8118)|
| 2:15:25| we have focused on making sure we have the greatest in medical technology and the expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8125)|
| 2:15:31| and the physicians to take care of our patients, we know that the medical aspect is only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| part of taking care of patients, that we need to also take a holistic approach and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:43| their emotional and psychosocial needs during their time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8143)|
| 2:15:48| And so, again, we're doing something novel. We're creating a healing garden, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8148)|
| 2:15:53| in a courtyard in the medical of the medical center. It is easily accessible to inpatients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8153)|
| 2:16:00| as well as outpatients, and it will give a place for patients and families to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8160)|
| 2:16:08| of move to outside. We know nature's very nurturing, and a place where the comfort and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8168)|
| 2:16:17| a respite from the medical environment to hope to improve their healing while they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:25| at our medical center. The budget originally for this project was 200,000. We have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| fortunate to give almost 100,000 in-kind services from the community already to start the garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8191)|
| 2:16:39| We do have detailed plans and hope to start phase one and have the funding to begin in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| the fall. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to come here and present our proposal again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:52| to this committee, and I appreciate the grants funding committee that heard this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8212)|
| 2:16:58| Could I answer any questions for anyone, please? Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8218)|
| 2:17:07| Interfaith Health Clinic. Good morning. My name is Melissa Knott. I'm with the Interfaith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| Health Clinic. I'm their executive director. Our address is 315 Gill Avenue, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:25| 37917. I appreciate the opportunity. Interfaith opened its doors in 1991, and I still think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:32| we're one of the best-kept secrets in Knoxville. Very early on, Knox County stepped to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| plate and has partnered with Interfaith since almost the very inception. You do not know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| the number of lives that this commission, your predecessors who sit on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| how many lives you have impacted. To briefly tell you a little bit about us, we are a doctor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| office. We provide primary medical, general dentistry, and counseling services five days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:58| a week. We serve the low-income, working, and insured. We partner with the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| Health Department. If you qualify for their indigent care program, you would go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| Knox County Health Department's indigent care program. If you make $1 over what you do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| qualify for that program, you could come to the Interfaith Health Clinic. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8292)|
| 2:18:17| stress that what we are able to do on a very low sliding fee scale, our patients pay 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8297)|
| 2:18:24| We have a standard fee that is comparable to the private sector, and if it would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| our patient $150 in the private sector, they're going to pay $15 and walk out the door. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| are very committed to being a hand-up and not a hand-out. We are able to do that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| a sliding fee scale because we have one paid physician and we have over 90 volunteer MDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| that come on site. We have one paid dentist and we have over 40 volunteer dentists who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| come on site. We have one paid therapist, mental health therapist, and we have, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| on the time of year, 6 to 12 volunteer therapists that step to the plate and help take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| of those patients. In addition to what we provide on site, we have developed a network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| of over 400 subspecialists who will see our patients and their offices on the same sliding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| fee scale. In addition, and I have to rethink how I say this, Covenant, Mercy, and UT Hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:15| all accept our sliding fee scale, no questions asked, so that our patients have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:20| total comprehensive health care. When you give to Interfaith Health Clinic, we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| about dollars being leveraged. The money that you are underwriting is leveraged many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:31| over. For example, we provide our patients their medication. We charge nothing for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| medication, but we do charge a $5 handling fee for each medication. That makes no difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| if it's an $8 bottle of pink liquid amoxicillin you have to pry a child's mouth open to pour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| in or if it's a $400 heart medication. We're able to do that and we will spend this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| approximately $120,000 in purchasing medication, but by the end of the year, we will have dispensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| right at $2 million wholesale cost, $2 million worth of medication to our patients. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| is no narcotics. That is strictly things for their blood pressure. It's things for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8402)|
| 2:20:08| their cholesterol. It is maintenance medications and antibiotics. In addition to those services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| we're able to provide a network with many other organizations that you have heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| today. I cannot stress enough how important the money that you give is to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:25| Our patients, 92% of our patients make minimum wage. They make just enough not to qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8425)|

| 2:20:36| the very individuals who are paying their own KUB bill. They're the individuals who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| are paying their taxes. By giving them a hand up, not a handout, we're able to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| their dignity. They are partnering with us as well as with you all in providing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| health care. At Interfaith, we have a wonderful mission statement. However, I very rarely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8451)|
| 2:20:56| ever refer to it, but we do ask our staff and our volunteers many things. The three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| things that we ask most often are children, the children that we serve, are we keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| them healthy enough to get up and go to school every day and learn? Are we keeping parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| healthy enough to take care of their children? Last of all, are we keeping our patients healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| enough to get up and go to work every day and be contributing members of our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| If we are, Interfaith Health Clinic is meeting its criteria and we're meeting our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:25| We're serving the individuals who are on the border. We're serving those individuals who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| choose to come to work, live in Knox County, go to work in Knox County and be contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8488)|
| 2:21:33| members of our community. But they're in a precarious situation. They're one paycheck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| away. They're one accident away. They're one hot water heater away, going out, away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:44| being on the brink of disaster. You all have been a tremendous support to us through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| years and I look forward to working with you all in the future. Every dollar that you give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| is leveraged many times over. We too are fortunate enough to have some grants that would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| come to Knox County if we could not get matching funds. Our total budget this year will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8518)|
| 2:22:04| cash about $2.2 million. It's going to be $2.211 million. And what that means is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:13| just in medications alone, we're already matching that and going out. Every other service that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:19| we do is above and beyond that. UT did a study on us with Maryville College a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8539)|
| 2:22:24| and like I said, this has been five or six years ago and at that point in time, the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| that were going out within one year, they equated to about $12 million. The money that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:34| you invest in Interfaith is invested very well. It is invested very wisely. But it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8554)|
| 2:22:39| not just dollars and it's not just statistics. It's the people that you work with, that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| see, that maybe will serve your lunch to you today. It's the people that work on your cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| Maybe the people that cut your hair. Those are the people that you are supporting when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| you support Interfaith. Again, I cannot thank you enough for the partnership over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| 16 years. I look forward to working with you all in the future. Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8578)|
| 2:23:03| A couple. Dr. Briggs? I'm going to take the privilege of making a comment here is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:10| people don't realize that what Interfaith and the other organizations, you know, Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8590)|
| 2:23:14| Dr. Kim's Clinic, the Knoxville Area Project Access do by providing affordable care to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8594)|
| 2:23:22| the working uninsured. I don't want to call them working poor because I think that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| wrong impression. But like you said, these are the people. They get up every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| They have a job. They go to work. They pay their taxes. They raise their children. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| they try to provide a home for their families. About 30 to 40 percent of the bankruptcies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| in this country are not due to people that have splurged too much on their credit cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| or done something that they shouldn't. It's due to medical bills. And I think it's organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| like Interfaith Health Clinic and some of those others that I mentioned that allow people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| to stay in their homes and raise their families and keep their jobs when they do get sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:57| because otherwise that's what would lead to bankruptcy. And these are very, very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| organizations that provide more than just health care for the community. And I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| to put a plug in just to try to support all of those if we can. And thank you, Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| Thank you, Dr. Briggs. Commissioner Daniels? Ms. Melissa, I was looking at what you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:16| had requested in the past. And it looks like in 2008, or for 2008, you all had requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:23| $150. You received $60. This year, you requested $150 and you received $148,125. With the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:31| process, why do you think that you were able to receive from the grant committees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:39| larger percentage of what you were asking for? By the way, I think you all do a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| job as well. I think that the panels, they heard that we were involved in helping people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8683)|
| 2:24:50| who are trying very hard. They're swimming as fast as they can. They're treading water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| to keep their head above ground. They're the individuals who are getting up and who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| trying. They're the individuals who are being contributing members of our community. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8699)|
| 2:25:05| as invaluable as it is, and you know, so often, and I want to support all the organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8705)|
| 2:25:12| and I know you all have a very difficult job, but Interfaith keeps people who are supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| themselves from not being able to support themselves. And so it's prevention in what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:24| when you invest your dollars in an organization like Interfaith, you're preventing someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| from needing the additional services and even being a greater burden on some of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| organizations that are already addressing homelessness and things like that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:39| And I think that really sounded through, that not only do we need to invest dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| in helping the homeless have a place to stay, but we also need to invest money in keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8744)|
| 2:25:49| people from becoming homeless. Well, and I know I had talked to Donna McEvers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| and Jim Burge both, and you know, I know this was a very strenuous process they went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8754)|
| 2:26:01| and I'm sure it was for you all as well. And that helps me understand, because obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8761)|
| 2:26:07| everyone on this commission has received a ton of well-written letters, well-written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:13| emails, phone calls, backed into corners, and asked questions about it. So I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:21| you explaining that. Thank you. Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| Melissa, how many people would you bring in during the course of a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| Well, right now we have about 8,300 active patient charts. In the past year, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| taken on over 1,500 additional active patients. We will provide this year, with the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8794)|
| 2:26:40| that we have received, approximately 26,000-27,000 patient visits. We will provide probably around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8800)|
| 2:26:48| 11,000 or 12,000 prescriptions. Those are the antibiotics, the antihypertensives, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| cholesterol medicines. And so if that helps you break down where the money is going, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8815)|
| 2:27:01| a, right now today, about 8,200-8,300 active charts. We'll see 26,000-27,000 patient visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8821)|
| 2:27:08| and fill those, that many prescriptions. And that does not count how many visits we refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:14| out to the subspecialist, because once we refer them out, we don't know how many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8834)|
| 2:27:21| that orthopedic or the cardiologist or whoever calls them to come back in. That's literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| what we do within our four walls. That's not what we provide access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| My point was going to be that if you have 27,000 visits, that's probably 27,000 visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| that's not going to the emergency rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| And so you have seen an increase. That was my next question. You said you have seen an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| increase with the economic situation and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| Yes. We have, of course, there's additional TennCare disenrollment that we expect to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8866)|
| 2:27:50| coming down at any point in time. And we're still in the same little 8,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8870)|
| 2:27:55| that we started out in. And to provide primary care, general dentistry and counseling within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| those 8,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| We have recently extended our hours. For years we were open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:06| to keep money going to direct patient services and not into capital dollars. We are now open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:11| until 9 p.m., 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., trying to keep people out of the emergency room, allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| them to go to work and then come to the clinic afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To expand a little bit, Dr. Briggs is talking about the 30 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:31| filing for bankruptcy, but also affects the tax rolls of Knox County, because of my unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:39| position of collecting those taxes. I hear story after story of people having to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:47| between their medical bills and paying property taxes. And if we can continue to help these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:54| folks help the people that do own property, they want to pay their taxes, but when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8934)|
| 2:29:01| put in a situation where they're having to decide, do I buy my medicine, do I go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| doctor, or do I pay my property taxes, and unfortunately a lot of them are having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8945)|
| 2:29:13| decide to pay their doctor bills. But if we can help those people out there, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8953)|
| 2:29:19| see some of that money back straight into our coffers, because now they're able to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:24| the property taxes. And it's really unfortunate when I see people unable to pay or coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:31| in late paying their property taxes simply because of medical bills. And I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| a tremendous thing that you all do, and I appreciate everything that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| Melissa, I want to thank you for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| It is always my pleasure. I believe that we're the best kept secret in Knoxville, so any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8988)|
| 2:29:49| Well, I don't think you're really a kept secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| You're not a secret anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| I want to thank you for the work that you all continuously do. I want to full disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=8995)|
| 2:30:00| I was one of the ones that started the organization, and you all are doing tremendous work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| I think about 18 years ago, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9008)|
| 2:30:09| That's the best thing that I've ever worked on in my life, and I really mean that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| I've told you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| Again, I cannot stress how much we value the time and the effort that you all have put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:20| into this process. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9020)|

| 2:30:42| of Knox County and the success that we've been able to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9042)|

| 2:31:11| Thank you. My name is Tom Von Berg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| The amount that we requested this year was $100,000, an increase over what we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| Many of you have heard in the papers and in the other media about the perfect storm that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| we're currently facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| We've done a very good job in the time that we've been in existence here, both in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| efficiency and effectiveness in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| Currently, however, as you may know, we have a reduction in major donations due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:42| economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9102)|
| 2:31:43| Places like Kraft and Cargill have not been able to put the kinds of things in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9103)|
| 2:31:49| warehouse that they used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| At the same time, with people losing jobs and having that kind of economic pressure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| our demand is up 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9116)|
| 2:32:00| And we're, like you and everybody else, paying those same higher prices for food and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9120)|
| 2:32:06| for fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:07| We're now currently spending $100,000 a month just to fill in the needed items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:13| were previously donated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| Our request this year actually covered four essential programs, all of which have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| impact on Knox County, not just today but in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| The $40,000 that we asked for for cased food is what we distribute to the 120 agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9147)|
| 2:32:36| partners, the food pantries, the Love Kitchens, the other members of this community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9156)|
| 2:32:43| serve the working poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| That represents a very small percentage of our total budget, but it is essential to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:52| what the services are that we provide to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:56| Our Food for Kids program is something that this community can be especially proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| because Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee now has the second largest children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| programs of this type in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| We have 32 of the 40 elementary schools in Knox County enrolled in the Food for Kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9189)|
| 2:33:15| program, a weekend backpack program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| Hard to believe that in Knox County that there are 1,200 kids that we serve every week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:27| with meals in backpacks that they wouldn't get otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| The results of those are clearly demonstrated in increased learning, improved overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| health, improved social skills, and believe it or not, reductions in crime because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9216)|
| 2:33:42| bullying for food and stealing from convenience stores is still a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9222)|
| 2:33:48| We have multiple collaborations with the YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, and virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| every other agency that you will listen to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| The other part of the amount that we asked for was for Kids Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| Let me back up here for just a second on Food for Kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| Our estimate is it costs about $4,000 to provide, on average, about 50 backpacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9247)|
| 2:34:14| and about 5,000 meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| So you can see we're extremely efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| The Kids Cafe program costs about $3,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9260)|
| 2:34:27| That's where we serve after-school meals and snacks to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| We have 26 of those sites in Knox County in safe sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| Many of them are the same kids, but an enlarged number is due to the fact that we go up to age 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9275)|
| 2:34:41| These meet at all kinds of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:45| YMCA's, again, Boys and Girls Clubs, teen centers, and places that you know in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9285)|
| 2:34:52| We also include nutrition education to try to break that cycle of hunger and poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:58| And, again, we have exceptional success rates with these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9298)|
| 2:35:04| The final one, and the one that really saves the most that we can talk about in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| is Knoxville Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| Many of you have seen our trucks going to the convention center or to Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| or to Food City or other places that provide prepared and perishable food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| This year we're going to pick up 3.5 million pounds of food that would otherwise be thrown away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9320)|
| 2:35:27| And that's going to save places like the Love Kitchen, like Knox Area Rescue Ministries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9327)|
| 2:35:33| like the Salvation Army, like the Morningside Towers, and many other agencies that receive this food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9333)|
| 2:35:40| That's going to save, in this county, $6 million in food costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9340)|
| 2:35:44| We provide that for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| So, in essence, we're bringing a great deal of financial value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9347)|
| 2:35:53| I noticed some of the folks that I have seen here in various committees that we have appeared before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9353)|
| 2:36:00| and they recognize, and I hope those of you who haven't recognize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9360)|
| 2:36:05| we are one of the most efficient nonprofits, not just in this city, not just in this region, but in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9365)|
| 2:36:14| Ninety-three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| That means that 93 cents of every dollar reaches an individual who is in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:22| Ninety-three cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| And by the same token, we're obviously extremely effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9384)|
| 2:36:28| With all that we do, there are still four times as much out there in terms of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9388)|
| 2:36:35| The one thing that you can say about hunger, that there is a cure for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| We recover it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| Do you all have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9408)|
| 2:36:53| Tom, I think you guys did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9413)|
| 2:36:55| I think that the return on investment is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9415)|
| 2:37:00| If we could all invest our money and give a return like what you guys do, it would be phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9420)|
| 2:37:08| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| One of the concerns I have is I was very actively involved with the Center of Hope, which has since shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:16| Are you seeing any of these other types of centers because of the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9436)|
| 2:37:23| or because of other factors are leaving doing what you guys help do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:30| Let Elaine answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| We have had some agencies that just did not have the funding to be able to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| So that's been a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| The increase because of the recent increase in food and gas prices, we've seen a direct effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9458)|
| 2:37:45| Our agencies have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9465)|
| 2:37:46| It's a downward spiral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| When people need it the most, some of the agencies are having to close because they don't have the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9467)|
| 2:37:53| to be able to stay open to help feed those who need to be fed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9473)|
| 2:37:59| So I commend you all for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| We are, however, referring many of the people that will come to us on an individual basis to the other locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9483)|
| 2:38:10| and we're also letting the other agencies know what we're doing if they were not aware of any of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9490)|
| 2:38:17| or additions that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9502)|
| 2:38:30| My name is Tom Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| It looks like this is like some kind of courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| Let's get relaxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| Everybody smile a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| It's just a tie like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| You're very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| Let's really relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| Especially I love Dr. Briggs came in to your board this year because he knows he's been on that field for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9526)|
| 2:38:54| trained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| So as far as health is concerned, he knows best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| So I want you all to help him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| I think he is great to sacrifice his practice and time for our community as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9542)|
| 2:39:12| Somebody is circulating our question and answer for free medical clinic right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9552)|
| 2:39:19| To try to save time, I prepared for what's all about free medical clinic is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9559)|
| 2:39:26| This is only a clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| We do not collect any single dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9568)|
| 2:39:31| Everything is free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| Free for blood test, free for diagnosed x-rays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearingpart1?start=9573)|
