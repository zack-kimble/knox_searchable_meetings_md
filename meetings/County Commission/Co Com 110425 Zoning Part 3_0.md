| 0:13:06| lands for potential recreational uses let me start by saying two things one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| the hillside and ridgetop protection plan is not primarily about scenic beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| it is about preventing soil erosion it is about preventing flooding and stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| sedimentation it is about preserving the trees and other vegetation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| filter out air pollutants it is about preserving the trees that ameliorate our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| climate and it is about enhancing property values to that last phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| points out the positive relationship between preservation of trees and open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| space and economic growth it has been amply demonstrated by numerous studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| that properties adjacent to green spaces have a higher value than equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| properties elsewhere the same holds true for properties on which trees have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| been preserved there has been frequently made the argument that one needs to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| compromises to natural values to have economic growth this is a false| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| dichotomy economies are healthiest in places where values like scenic beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| air quality water quality and green spaces are given priority the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| needs to be made that we need to talk about economic health and growth that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| benefits the greatest number of people not just a select few special interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=856)|

| 0:14:26| two of the poorest states in the country at the same time that the coal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=866)|

| 0:15:15| estimated that from 25 to 50 percent of an area's natural communities need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=915)|

| 0:26:01| Commissioner Briggs comments started me thinking so I did some research Asheville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1561)|

| 0:26:12| steps to protect their hillsides and ridgetops so I looked at some numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| from there here's one three hundred ninety thousand nine hundred and seventy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1576)|

| 0:26:31| fifty one thousand seven fifteen last week here's another number one hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| and seventy five thousand dollars that's the average sales price of a home in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Asheville during the first quarter of this year that compares to Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| average of ninety nine thousand and seventy dollars for the same time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| so the average listing price of homes in Asheville last week was forty four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1613)|

| 0:30:31| to the hillside and ridgetop protection plan primarily developers and a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| realty groups that have been busing their agents to meetings to protest the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| plan. These opponents have presented a lot of misinformation. They've claimed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| that this plan will give the local government power to take land and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| restrict how individuals can develop their own private property. These claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| are simply not true. This plan doesn't even affect property of less than five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| acres and it doesn't change any existing zoning. It would only come into play if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| and when a property owner with more than five acres of land requests that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| property be rezoned. The protesters are tonight carrying signs that say protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| property, property rights. Well that's something we all agree on, but the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1881)|
| 0:31:29| whose property rights actually need to be protected are those who own land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| adjacent to steep hillsides and ridgetops. We believe that they have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| right to not have their property flooded by runoff and to not have their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| devalued by the loss of privacy that happens when steep slopes behind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| are stripped of trees. I'm speaking specifically of a hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| development that has impacted hundreds of families who own homes in Statesview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| and Seven Oaks, although there are many others like those in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| And I would like to add that Statesview is a neighborhood of affordable homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| It's a neighborhood that's an older neighborhood. I don't know how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| people here represent Statesview, but the average cost of a home there is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| $100,000 to $150,000. It's a good price point for people who want to live in West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| Knox County. They have been dramatically affected by clear-cutting right next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| where they live. The particular example I'm talking about is on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| of Kingston Pike across from Kroger's Marketplace in the Cedar Springs area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| You can't miss it. In fact, you could probably spot it from outer space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| considering how big it is. The clear-cutting on this site affects Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| County properties, property owners here and now. The problem with this site is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1975)|
| 0:33:04| that the land under development is annexed to the city, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| neighborhoods surrounding it are zoned county. As a result, there's pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| nobody looking out for the interests of the people who live adjacent to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| because the City Council doesn't represent these county residents and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| County Commission doesn't have any authority over what the city allows to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| be built on its land. It is specifically situations like this that create a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| for this plan because it would provide guidance for both the city and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| county. The Council of West Knox County homeowners asks you to vote yes to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| plan. We are not land speculators. We would like to maintain our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| rights today. We want to see our tax dollars used for more parks and greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| and better schools instead of used to clean up floodwaters and to dredge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| creeks that are choked with muddy runoff. I'm speaking here of another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| specific problem area, the stretch of Ten Mile Creek that runs along old Ebenezer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| Road. But again, trouble spots like this exist all over the county and they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| either caused by poor land use or made worse because of it. One last thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| there's been a lot said recently about how Knox County needs to attract new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| industry and jobs and the council totally agrees with this. But if we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| to get serious about bringing in new business, we need to start paying more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| attention to what makes an area a great place to live. Please do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| and vote yes to the hillside and ridgetop plan, not only because it makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| good environmental sense, but because it also makes good business sense. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| Our next person, David Drewes. David Drewes, thank you for coming and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2095)|
| 0:35:08| give us your address for the record please. 2238 Spence Place. Some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2108)|
| 0:35:17| will preserve beauty for beauty's own sake. Others need economic reasons. Often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| these motivations converge. I spent part of the 80s and 90s as a banker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| specializing in commercial and residential real estate. I analyzed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| pursued real estate deals all over the country and invariably towns with high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| property values also had considerable and healthy green spaces where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| development and nature complemented each other. In these towns the government and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| the real estate community created standards so development impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| ecosystems as little as possible. By voting for this MPC plan, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| can practice the type of land stewardship we see in cities like Austin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| Asheville, and Denver and other cities. And by stewardship I mean protecting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| environment and protecting our land values at the same time. All of our land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| values from those of us with half an acre to those of us with a hundred acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| However, if this Commission fails to support the principles laid out in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| well-wrought plan, our county will continue to suffer economic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| aesthetic losses. Every time a developer slices off a ridgetop or carves out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| chunk of a hillside, our property values go down. All of our property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| eventually go down. It's fundamental. People want to live in scenic places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| These don't have to be high-dollar resort places. They just have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| places where people step outside, walk outside, and they see nature and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| pleases them. It's that simple. We have it. We've done a lot of damage here but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| still have it. If we let this opportunity go by, it could be the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| time or the last time in a long time before we have a chance to rectify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| damage that has been done and set us on a course where we can grow as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| scenic community. As many of you know, the market has caught up with this maxim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| by developing green investment criteria. Development valuations are no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| limited to just contingencies, interest expense, excavation costs, or other budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| items. Today, trees, streams, hills, erosion and flooding issues, and water and air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| quality issues often impact values. Developers can make these conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| investments on the front end or watch the marketplace discount their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| properties. The MPC plan is a policy guide that takes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2276)|
| 0:38:05| account both conservation necessities and private property rights, not one over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| the other. Many who oppose this plan want the public to believe that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| plan is anti-development, but this is simply not the case. This ridgetop and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| hillside protection plan does not prevent development. It does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| recommend we stop all ridge and hillside development. It just lays out a plan, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| plan on how our community can practice wise development that, again, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| ultimately increase all of our property values and, as a nice side benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| enhance our quality of life. Imagine driving down any of our four main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| arteries, Kingston Pike, Chapman Highway, Magnolia, or Broadway. See all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| sign pollution and sections of blight, but also see the lush green ridges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| hillsides. They seem to go on forever, and they kind of do, stretching out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| suburbs and beyond. Now imagine your drive without the ridges and hillsides, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| drive with barren, deforested hills and ridges sliced down to exposed red clay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| That ugly picture is a bankrupt vision. Commissioners, today you can create a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| vision by adopting this plan, a very modest plan that will, nonetheless, help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2364)|

| 0:40:13| protecting our hillsides and our ridgetops, literally. I have a deed that says one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| them is mine. I'm here to speak on behalf of those who own those hillsides and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| ridgetops and can truthfully say they're ours. Let me qualify that by saying I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| been asked to speak on behalf of visitors to KnoxCountyPropertyRights.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| So I may not speak for all these property owners, but I speak for quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| few. A couple of housekeeping issues. Using the term plan to minimize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| importance of this is disingenuous. This plan will directly affect the prism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| through which MPC looks at proposals and makes recommendations to this body. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| will fundamentally change the way property is developed. This matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| Second, this is a property rights issue. To quote a member of the MPC staff, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| quote, well, duh. We all know it's a property rights issue. We've asked over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| and over again what gives anybody the right to intrude on property rights like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| this. And I've gotten a civics lesson. U.S. versus Railroad, Euclid versus Amber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| And we get that. This body has the right to regulate. We support that. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| we'd like to say that just because you can, in this case, is not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| That power to regulate is granted to you by us. And when you take on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| authority to regulate, you have a fiduciary responsibility. Calvin Coolidge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| said ultimately property rights and personal rights are the same thing. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| you exercise your power in a way that intrudes upon personal rights, property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| rights, the right to free speech, you have to ask yourself two questions. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| first is, is this intrusion absolutely necessary? Not because it's cheaper, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| because it's easier, but because there's no other way to achieve what must be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| done. We see this in questions like, is my safety and the safety of airline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| passengers important enough that we ask people to sacrifice their right to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| privacy for screening? They're not easy questions. But does this issue raise to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| that level? Secondly, you must decide if the first is true, does this affect as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| few people as possible and in as small a way as possible? The problem here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| that when you attack 62,000 pieces of property or 30,000 or 15,000 or 1500, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| fail on both counts. You've not visited my property. You don't know what may or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| may not be proposed. As an example, my property appraisal would go down. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| got a lot of property over 50%. That comes off my personal financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| statement. When I go to buy a car, I pay a higher interest rate. If my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| never becomes before this body for rezoning, that's unnecessary. As to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| second part, there's been a lot of discussion. It's not 62,000 parcels. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| 30,000. Well, if there's 30,000 in here that don't need to be, you cannot make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| the argument that this affects as few people as possible. We submit to you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| be at this plan, an alternative plan, an amended plan, or any legislation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| comes before you that involves sacrificing personal rights, that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| have to ask, is this absolutely necessary and does it affect as few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| people as possible? Regardless of all the other arguments, starting slope, transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| tax, regardless of all these things, you must first evaluate your fiduciary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| responsibility. If the principle here is flawed, the rest of the issues really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| don't matter. We are property owners. We ask that you preserve our right to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| hillsides and our ridgetops, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2629)|
| 0:44:01| Our next speaker is Dan Hurst. Dan Hurst. And if you give us your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2641)|
| 0:44:10| Thanks, Commissioner. I'm Dan Hurst. My address is 1800 Chestnut Grove Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| Knoxville 37932. So this is obviously a really important issue, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2656)|
| 0:44:25| really respect and appreciate your service and deliberation carefully on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| because you have two critical matters at hand. One is the rights of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| property owners. The other is the long-term stewardship of the region to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| which we've been entrusted. So I'm a fourth-generation East Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| Coincidentally, I'm Scots-Irish. And I have children. I'll be 50 next year. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2688)|
| 0:44:55| born here in Knoxville. I've lived all of my life here except for four years when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| I was in the U.S. Navy. I have children myself, and who knows, maybe one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| they'll have children. And I think about each one of us here tonight, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| drive home, we'll either embrace these springtime ridgetops and enjoy the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| they look, or we'll view some things that are less pleasant to view and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| probably turn the other way or think of something else. And I feel like each one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2721)|
| 0:45:29| of you as commissioners, this is the kind of issue that you'll probably literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| confront with your children or grandchildren, and they can ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| question, why did you guys do this? Grandpa, why did they cut the top off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| that hill and make fill dirt out of it? So it's a really important and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2742)|
| 0:45:50| challenging point. I was thinking as I was sitting here listening, they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| having this debate in Omaha or in Amarillo or in Wichita because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| haven't been entrusted with the same natural beauty that we have. Our ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| are inspirational. This piece of art shows our ridges and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| waterways. It inspired the artists that created it and evidently the folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| commissioned it to be here on the wall because that's what defines our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| So I'm a business owner. We employ about a hundred or so engineers and scientists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| in the region, and something that's important to us is that the quality of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| their life and the quality of life as it relates to recruiting new high-paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| jobs to the region and development of jobs in the region. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| things that's on every brochure probably of every business that's in here if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| you're recruiting to East Tennessee is our ridgetops, our waterways, our natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| beauty. So in my opinion, this natural beauty plays a major role in increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| property values and increasing the marketability of the region. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| we're being very short-sighted if we don't take some action, and I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| this plan is a reasonable step in that direction, to preserve those things and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| to ensure that there's dialogue before more and more of the ridgetops are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| carved away. Because I do believe that four generations from now, whenever my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| great-great-great-grandkids are talking about the region, I hope they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| comparing it to Omaha or Wichita, but they're fully embracing these ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| that have inspired us today. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| Next we have Mr. Matt Hardwick. Mr. Matt Hardwick. Is Mr. Hardwick here? If he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| comes in, we'll give him a chance to speak. Mike Heumann. Is Mike Heumann here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2865)|
| 0:47:55| Kevin Hill. Yes, sir, if you give us your address to the record, please. 509 Cambridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920. My mother said before I came out today that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| my father would be rolling in his grave right now. He was a developer in West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| Knox County up until about 10 years ago, and I don't think he would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| rolling in his grave because he drove me through neighborhoods in West Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| County, built on steep slopes, and shook his head and said, I can't understand how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| anyone can build that. Because he understood the negative impact it has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| the property owners around that development and withinside that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| development because of the issues that have been laid out over and over. I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| to focus in on my childhood home. It's already been addressed by the lady who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| spoke about Statesview. I grew up in Statesview. Spent 20 years in and out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| that house, and my mother still lives there. When they first came through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| wanting us to stand up against high-density development on our doorstep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| our response, because of our connection to the development community in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| was to say, no, we're big property rights supporters. If they own that land and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| they want to build that there and it's been approved by our government to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| then we're not going to stand in their way. Well, we now live with the aftermath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| of that development. We live with a roadway that's filled with mud every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| time it rains because from the density that was built there and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| packing down of the soil that will never loosen up and never allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| water to seep into the ground level again, we now deal with a constant stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| of mud across our street as we come down the hill into our neighborhood. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| stare at detention ponds, not retention ponds that have no fences around them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| but supposedly detention ponds that are supposed to clear out within a matter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| a little while after the storm, standing with water for a week straight, creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| a safety hazard for the children in that neighborhood who, if any neighbor in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| that neighborhood of states you wanted to put in a pool, they'd have to put up a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| fence and they would have to meet all kinds of standards. Yet, I can put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| detention pond that doesn't actually function as a detention pond, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| functions as a pond for a week or more at a time and leave all the children in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| that neighborhood at risk to wander into a hazardous situation. We now live just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| on the doorstep of the new development that was mentioned, where yet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| another one of these large detention ponds has been put in, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| not only building on a steep slope, but actually increasing drastically the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| slope. And now we watch a muddy flow of water behind our house at the bottom of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| the hill every time it rains, and we stare at a scummy pond just off the edge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| of our neighbor's house. And we look at a hill that was built up with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| protections put into it and wonder what's going to happen the first time a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| little kid, because this is supposed to be affordable housing, which means young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| families, what's going to happen the first time a little kid rolls all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| way down that four-story hill into that detention pond? And so my natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| inclination is not to be standing here on the side of the argument that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| limit a property owner in any way, but I've seen the impact of what we have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| place and on existing property owners. And so to redress that quickly, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| safety hazards for the previous residents. We've allowed a safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| hazard to be built all around existing homes in this community, where children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| can be drowned, where if the water's left standing long enough we can have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| mosquito hazard. How many times do we hear about the mosquito trucks going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| through neighborhoods? Well now we've created mosquito breeding grounds for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| them. It doesn't require a full pond, it just requires a boggy area, and this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| one never gets less than boggy. And so it is a matter of property rights, but as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| many people have said time and time again standing here, it's property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| of the existing property owners that surround these properties that have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| be equally considered. And so we beg you, if you have not driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| through Statesview after a rain, table any vote tonight and you drive through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| Statesview after this rain and see the mud that collects on our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| Thank you. Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3163)|
| 0:52:51| Our next speaker is Kent Bresford. Mr. Bresford, if you'd give us your address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| I'm Kent Bresford and it's 2368 McCampbell Wells Way. And I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| recognize the commission here tonight. Thank you for all serving. I know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| all have jobs and things that you're going to do with your families and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| spend a lot of time doing this. And I am very appreciative and many, many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| it is a thankless job and I appreciate all of you. I want to say clearly that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| do not reject regulation. We have to have it. And I am in favor of zoning. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| I want to see those things enforced and I think want to see those things done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| well. And I develop property. I talked with city engineering, county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| engineering and I have a good relationship with them and we try to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| the best we can. And we are not perfect either. I've come to ask you tonight to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| respect the time and energy that all the people who have come here tonight to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| settle this issue. And I ask you to make an up or down vote on this hillside and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| ridgetop plan from MPC. We have read the plan in its entirety and we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| it and its consequences and the consequences it will bring. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| oppose this plan. I want you to know that we do desire a plan. Unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| this plan is overreaching. According to state law you cannot debate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| amendments to this plan. You can only vote it up or down and we are asking you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| to do that tonight without delay. So the only way to compromise and we do want a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| plan and the only way to compromise and the only way that it can be achieved is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| to vote the plan down and send it back to MPC. Our county mayor Tim Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| opposes this plan in its current form. The Knoxville Chamber opposes this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| in its current form. The Knoxville News-Sentinel wrote an article today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| opposing the plan. And the Knoxville Realtors and Home Builders oppose this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| plan. And the majority of people here tonight oppose this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3285)|
| 0:54:58| I find it interesting that many of the homeowners associations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| voted to support this plan that were chronicled by one of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| earlier, probably a third of those would have a very difficult time being passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| under this plan today. But it's okay because they're already in their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3312)|
| 0:55:23| Our Knoxville Chamber has created an alternative plan. It's a good starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| point. It probably isn't perfect either, but nothing is. And I ask respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| that you vote this plan down tonight and start a new process so a compromise can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| be achieved. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you for your comments. Our next individual who has asked to speak, Robert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| Hill. Robert Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3352)|
| 0:56:04| Mr. Hill, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| My address is 11504 Mountain View Road, Knoxville 37934. I've lived there since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| 1962. Owned the land since 1962. Paid tax on it since 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| And it's a nice place to live, on a hill, on a slope. So the map says practically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3381)|
| 0:56:28| flat, however. I'm here to say not all the good things that the people have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3388)|
| 0:56:37| before me, which cover the technical issues of this totally, I think. I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| to speak to you as a commissioner. I sat in those seats up there for ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| from 1970 to 1980. And right there where Mr. Shouse sits. We didn't do zoning at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| the time. We were a fiscal and legislative body. After I got off of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| county court, it was called county court then, in two years I was appointed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| member of the planning commission in Farragut. I agreed with Bob Leonard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| serve two years. I served 27 years. I was chairman for about three-fourths of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| time. And I want to tell you that if this plan had been in effect, when I moved to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3441)|
| 0:57:29| Farragut on a subdivision that's 18-foot streets, no curbs and gutters, no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| sidewalks, it's a nice place to live. We like it. Forty-three houses. We've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| four generations of people raised in there. Affordable housing, I might add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| When I moved here, if this plan had been in effect, Knox County would be a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3466)|
| 0:57:53| different looking place than it is now. No question about it. I've had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| benefit of four decades of looking at government decisions, of which I was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| part. And during that time, I found that I made some mistakes and some mistakes I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| didn't make. But I was able to get some perception of the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| You folks, as commissioners, are being asked to make a decision tonight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| does not include any absolutes. You've got all the facts, all that you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| to have. And you have to take this situation into consideration that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| represent some 390,000 people in Knox County, not just the people in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| but all the rest of the people here also. A lot of them are very interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| Part of my retirement work is being chairman of the Sierra Club here in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| area. It's the Harvey Broome Group. We have about 800 members in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| They're very interested in this. We're very interested in seeing it passed. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| think you ought to vote for it. But on the other hand, you have to weigh the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| pluses and minuses of the decision. And when you do that, you need to take into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| consideration how the county is going to look not tomorrow or not next year but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| 10 or 20 years from now. And that's going to make a big difference, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| You need to think positively about that. We live in a wonderful part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| country. I've come from Alabama. Flat as a tabletop. I like hillsides. I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| trees. I like to hike. I like everything about this. That's why I stayed. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| moved here by the railroad in 1954. And I decided I would stay forever. And I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| And you folks have an opportunity tonight to do something for Knox County that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| never had on this county commission. And you can do the work that you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| tonight on this vote, if you vote affirmatively for it, will be remembered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| for years and years when people look back and say, that was a very wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| commission that did that. Look how this place looks. And I can't say it any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| simpler than that. It's just, it's all about the future. We've had the past. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| know how that looks. So let's take a view of the future. This plan contains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| elements in it that will make the future of this town and this county very bright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| very beautiful, very enjoyable, and a very good place to live. It is now, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| will be an even greater place to live then. Thank you very much, and good luck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| on your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Robyn Askew. Robyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3640)|

| 1:01:00| 7012 Old Kent Drive, Knoxville, 37919. I don't have a prepared speech. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| comments that I've made listening to the others, and I appreciate, as a member of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| the Chamber of Commerce, the passion and commitment that I see on the part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| folks here. You have before you all of the facts that you need. I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| several memos and emails that you've gotten for the last several days, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| you know the pros and cons that each group possesses. You've heard a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| horrific things here tonight about rivers and children dying and all sorts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| things. You don't have any worries about that, because if we enforce the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| that are on the books now, we don't have to worry. We believe that those purple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3704)|
| 1:02:00| lines up there need to be protected. The laws that are on the books today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| protect everything below a 40% slope. This plan, this 78-page plan, goes too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3725)|
| 1:02:14| far. The costs are unknown, the way it will be implemented is unknown, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| area that it impacts is far too broad. Over 130,000 acres. 63,000 landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3739)|
| 1:02:28| who've not been notified. And again, I know that keeps coming up, but to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| that's a moral issue. We need to notify them. I want to correct one thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3753)|
| 1:02:48| was said. It said someone, if you own less than five acres, it doesn't impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| you. It's my understanding that's not correct. If you own a parcel that is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| of a five-acre piece that is a contiguous slope, your land is impacted. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| that is a misstatement, and I wanted to clear that up. What we are asking you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| do tonight is to create a legacy of doing the right thing. What we want you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| to do is to send this back. Vote this down tonight. Send it to codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| enforcement. Send it to your engineering departments, and send it to MPC for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| responsible action on protecting our ridgetops. You can protect the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| owner's rights in an environmentally sensible and responsible way. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3821)|
| 1:03:48| Mr. Stevens, did you wish to speak? Mike Stevens, if you could give us your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| Yes, thank you. I'm Mike Stevens. I live at 1663 Mystic Street in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| 37922. I, too, would like to commend the commissioners and MPC for the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3841)|
| 1:04:10| work that's been done on this already. And I know we've all been coming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| here for months now debating this, and as I sit here listening to the debate, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| conclude a little bit of what was just said, and that is that a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| issues we're talking about are TDEC and engineering. They're not really for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| county commissioner or MPC to decide. It's the job of TDEC to stop silt from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| getting into the river, and if that's not happening, then that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| I think the Home Builders Association and myself as a builder certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| support the quality of our water and the beauty of our area, but I guess I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| here to say a couple of things, and one is I have been the past president of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| the Home Builders Association. I'm currently the president for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| I'm a national association board member for the past ten years, and I only say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| that to say I've had the opportunity to talk to a lot of builders and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| developers around the country, and this isn't a new debate, but I will say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| these 78 pages are very far-reaching. They go further than I think anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| intends for them to go, and I guess I want to just say a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| about that. One of my members handed me three questions, and I sat there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| thinking about it, and I think these three questions have to be answered by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| this board, and that is, first of all, how would this help our economy if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| these guidelines are passed? And it won't. I mean, government has three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| choices. You can either decrease your services, you know, lay firemen off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| lay policemen off, lay teachers off. You can raise the tax rates, or you increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| your base. This proposal decreases your base, not just now, but forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| It takes a lot of property, both commercial and residential, off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| now and forever, so your base is going to be decreased, so you're left with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| other two options. Neither one, I think, this body wants to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| The second is, how does this help the home buyer in the long run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| I listened to the coalition of 24 different subdivisions that support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| and I concur. I would say half of those developments wouldn't be here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| if this had been implemented 10 years ago. It's kind of easy to get in your home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| and say, okay, that's enough, I don't want any more, but a lot of our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| developments in Knox County are more than 15%, and you need to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| And the last thing is how...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| And how do these guidelines help landowners? And again, I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| Sullivan said it best, it doesn't. As a landowner, you certainly expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| regulations. You expect for certain things to be put upon you as a landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| But every landowner has the right to use their property to the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| and best use, and in this case, it takes 132,000 acres off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| so that the homeowner is not deciding that, a small group of people are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| and that's just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4032)|
| 1:07:22| I live and build in two developments that would not be there if these guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| had been in place. One of them is North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| Last Tuesday night, I had the opportunity to meet with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| superintendents of schools and several board members, and Commissioner Wright was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| And we were talking about the new school and some other issues that relate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| to County Commission, and I asked Commissioner Wright, I said, do you understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| have you gone on MPC and clicked on the program that tells you what property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| could and could not be developed? And he said he had seen it, but didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| you know, wasn't that familiar with it. I don't want to put words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| I'll let you speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| I was there for the school meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Yes, sir, thank you. And that's right, and we were talking about other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| But I said, do you realize this falls in the guidelines of more than 15 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| And when you stand and look at that property, it's not steep property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| It's not eroding property. It's not problem property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| It's my home, and it's a beautiful spot, and there's going to be a lot more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| that live there, and when these guidelines reach that type of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| in my opinion, it's too far reaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| And I would say that this definitely needs to be voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| The Home Builders Association, I as a builder developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| support some type of guidelines that support those purple areas on that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| But you've got to understand, this reaches down way into the valleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| It's more far reaching than what you see on that wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| And so I would encourage you, and I think the Home Builders Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| would encourage you to please vote this down tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| and let's start the process back over with some of the professionals on that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| I want to check and see if either Matt Hardwick or Mike Heumann,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| have either of those folks come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| If not, we have two speakers remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| And Lonnie Harris, if you would come forward, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| and if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| My name is Lonnie Harris. I live at 2535 Old Callahan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| I guess I didn't prepare anything. I didn't think I was going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| I thought some other issues would be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| One thing I want to point out, this piece of artwork we're talking about up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| somebody pointed out to me the other day that almost for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| that piece of artwork costs more than what it would have cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| to notify the property owners that own the property on those ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4191)|
| 1:10:01| I don't remember who it was who pointed it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| but I thought it was a very astute observation on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| Let me give you a little history on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| First of all, I was a commercial landscaper for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| I've done huge projects. I've done projects in mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| I've done projects on no slope at all, on severe slopes, moderate slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| We never had a problem stabilizing any hillside we ever worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| There's a very easy method of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| However, it has to be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| You can't tell somebody to go do it and expect them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| You have to go back and make sure that they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| And when you require a bond of a letter of credit rather than a surety bond or a cash bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4247)|
| 1:10:55| that's sort of stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| I mean, my property, I connected to a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| I had to put up a $300,000 bond, not a letter of credit, a bond just to hook to the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4260)|
| 1:11:09| That's the state's requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| Why would we be any less here for a development as large as what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| But that's how we operated for a number of years, and we've reaped the rewards of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| But that's fixable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| That is fixable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| We can change some of the regulations along these lines that will assure us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| that the proper techniques will be enforced where they haven't been up till now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| Up till now, it has been cheaper for some developers to pay the fines than to correct the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4298)|
| 1:11:46| That, again, is fixable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| We do not have to resort to driving a straight pin with a sledgehammer in order to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| We can reforest hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| I've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| I've done it many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| It's doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| The state has a program by which for issues like this, you can buy whips, small trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| for $1.35 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| The state produces them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| They can be bought to put on hillsides like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| Now, in reference to this gentleman back here was talking about the detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| The detention pond, when I was growing up, I'm 68 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| I've lived in Knoxville since 66 of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| I lived in Chattanooga for two of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| When I was growing up, there wasn't any detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| We lived on hillsides, ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| We had them all over Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Still do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| We don't have problems out of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| Why are we suddenly going to have a problem out of developing ridgetops and hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| when we've had over 200 years of it and haven't had a major problem with it just recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| I mean, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| Let's be reasonable about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| This hasn't been reasonable to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| The detention ponds that this gentleman was talking about, if they were enforced properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| they would work properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Detention ponds have done an awful lot to curtail the water quality problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| that Knoxville used to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| We have no idea what's going to happen over the next 50 years as far as technology changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| There's a lot of things going on right now in the plant industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| That's what I'm associated with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| I'm a grower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| I know what's going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Right now, they're working in order to improve water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| They're working on plant species, grain species in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| that are perennial rather than annual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| so you don't have to plow every year in order to get the grain off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| The root system on these plants are four times as big as what the annuals are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| thereby holding the soil in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| That's a major part of where we're getting the soil in the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| Now, when I was a kid, the river looked a whole lot worse than what it does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| It's changed much, much for the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| But what we're hearing here, oh, the river's about to fill up with silt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| I beg to differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| I beg to differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| It is your responsibility tonight to do what is right for this city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| not to do what a small group of ecologists want done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| and a group of people from subdivisions that are not aware that there are provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| to prevent what's going on, they just aren't being enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| Now, perhaps MPC is a little top-heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Maybe we need to reduce it and put more people out in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| When we spend $340,000 on a piece of paper that my 11-year-old could have came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4494)|
| 1:15:08| as far as reasoning, it makes me wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| It makes me wonder about the leadership of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| If this were a corporation, that leadership would be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| Mr. Harris, I don't mean to be rude, but your five minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Please vote this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4527)|
| 1:15:37| We have one other speaker, and that's Mr. Joe Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| If you would come to the podium and give us your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4540)|
| 1:15:48| Joe Hulquist, 2240 Fisher Place, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| Commissioners, I think most of you know who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I've spoken to you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| I'm also serving as the city co-chair of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| We've heard a lot of good comments from both sides here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| I agree with some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Some of them I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| I agree with some on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| You might be surprised to hear that, but you've got a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| People have said that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| I think you have more than one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| You can vote for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| You can vote the plan down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| In either case, it can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| I think that's an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| You could also table the plan, in which case it could be addressed further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| during that tabling time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| I think you have more than one option here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| That said, I just want to talk a little bit about process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| We've said it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Three years' worth of work by a fairly diverse task force went into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| development of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| A lot of input, a lot of public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| You all have heard all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| I won't go over it again, but a lot of work and a lot of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| What we've seen is a substantial amount of, I'll call it input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4617)|
| 1:17:05| negative input sort of at the 11th hour where individuals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| organizations have stepped up and said, we don't like the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| We think it's overreaching, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| I have great respect for my friend Mike here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| Mike Stevens, tremendous respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| I consider him a friend and a very good man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| I don't necessarily agree with everything you said tonight, Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| and you don't necessarily agree with everything I may be saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| or have said in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| I don't, but I have respect for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| I disagree on the word overreaching, and I am supporting the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| and I would prefer that you vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| Having said that, my question is, from a process standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| how did we get to this point today, and how do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| If you say, okay, we like the plan or we don't like the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| you vote the plan up or you vote the plan down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| clearly there are those here who, for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| whether it was intentional or unintentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| whether they were paying attention before or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| their voices were not heard until this came to you, the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| They weren't heard over the past three years for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| There are exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Mr. Harris is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| While I may disagree with Mr. Harris, I will say for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| he was at all those meetings and spoke forcefully, just as he did tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| So I have great respect for him in that context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| A lot of the other voices we have not heard until just recently, again, the 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4716)|
| 1:18:44| And that raises the question in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| how do we do business in Knoxville and Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| Do we initiate a process under good faith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| Again, in this case, as we know, it was initiated by resolution of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| and of city council jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| So it's not exactly a hidden process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| It's a public process, but a publicly initiated process done in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| Not perfect, but done in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| And yet we seem to fall back into this zero-sum game of we don't agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4754)|
| 1:19:23| so we win, you lose, whichever side you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| And I don't think that's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| I don't think it helps us move forward as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| People talk about how Chattanooga has progressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Well, Chattanooga has, through their Vision 2000 process, Revision 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| all the things that have happened there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| they've sort of built a culture of community involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| and getting people to the table and figuring out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| well, let's get together and figure out what are strengths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| what are the commonalities that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| what are the things we can agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| and then address the issues that we can't agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| I think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| And if we fall back into the situation where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| okay, somebody's going to win and somebody's going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| I mean, I've served on city council for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| I know what you all are dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| And sometimes it just works out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| But I don't think it has to all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| and I certainly don't think it has to in the context of building a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| and a process like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| So what I would suggest to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| whatever decision you make, and I hope that you vote for the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| but whatever decision you make, I would ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| let me put it as a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| how do you foresee it proceeding from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| We've heard people that are opposed to the plan say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| send it back to MPC, reject it and send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| What is that going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| And will we end up any better off than we are now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Will there be any clarity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Will there be forward movement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Will there be any consensus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| And one of the things I would say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| whatever your action, I would encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| and any organizations that have stepped forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| to ask them to put their commitment on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| And I would say that for the Chamber of Commerce, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| The Chamber, Mr. Edwards not long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| said to one of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| the Chamber really doesn't have a dog in its fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| We're not going to get involved, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Well, they, and that was after the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| So they flipped on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| They changed their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| They looked at it, whatever reason they had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| they changed their mind and decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| no, we better get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| But what I would ask you to ask them is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| whatever you do, whether you turn it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| or whether you pass it, we shouldn't stop here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| Even if you approve the plan, and I hope you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| we shouldn't stop here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| We should say, people have real concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| Those concerns need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| They need to be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| The Chamber of Commerce needs to be at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| and they need to make that commitment to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| and to the rest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| The Home Builders Association needs to be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4920)|
| 1:22:07| The Greater Knoxville Association of Home Builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| needs to be at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| and they need to make that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| And I believe, because of Mike Stevens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| and others involved in that organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| that they probably will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| But I think you all are the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| that have to make sure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| And certainly the Realtors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| And anybody else, group or individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| that's spoken tonight, not everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| can be on a task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| but through those organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| they can have some representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| So I would ask you to make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4959)|
| 1:22:47| Those are all the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Yes, you would like to speak, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| No, let's give her a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| My name is Rachel Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| My address is 2222 Island Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| And I'm not going to speak very long at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| I know you all have already heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| that I support the plan and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| I just wanted to address one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| Not so much for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| because I know you all understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| but for the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| because I'm not sure all the audience does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| Some of the things that were said tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| would lead one to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| that this plan would prohibit development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| and slopes above 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| And you know that that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| What this plan does is use 15%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| as the starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| for looking at how we do development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| make sure we do it in a smart way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| in a quality way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| in a way that doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| real detrimental impacts on the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| So it always bothers me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| when I hear somebody leave the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| when somebody says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| my subdivision couldn't be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| because it's on slopes steeper than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Things can be built under this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| on slopes above 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| There's no prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| And I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| that everybody in the room understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| Commissioners, the motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| And Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| if we could have clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| on exactly what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| It's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| that if you vote in favor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| then this plan will go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| And that doesn't mean that it stops there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| that it can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| City Council still has to do their part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| If it is voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| if a no vote means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| that it would be up to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| to present to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| its version of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| So there can be no amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| there can be no change to the plan this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| It's either a vote yes or vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| I guess I'll defer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| and I was actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| I'm going to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| but I think there's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| I think we have another option other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| and I've said from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| of the reporting out process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| that the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| when they started to discuss this with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| that we needed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| I won't say meet somewhere in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| I have a vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| but however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| I think that it's incumbent upon us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5142)|
| 1:25:50| to give this process a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| And one thing that I think happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| when the developers start to drop off the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| that that sent a message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| whether right or wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| that somehow this was a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| you know, one-sided team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| I wasn't there for the tens of dozens of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| that were out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| but I've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| as we've all kind of kept abreast of this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| So I'm going to introduce a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| that we table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| And the reason that I'm going to introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| Folks, folks, folks, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| We're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| now we've been respectful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| We've been very respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| And I would ask that you be respectful to us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| And I appreciate everyone that come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| and talked about how respectful we've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| We've been very respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| So please give us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| please allow us a little time to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| This isn't a simple issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| and my reason for that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| I think that there's some middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| And I would like for this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| it's been three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| It's been three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| This is major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| As we see by tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| it's been three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| It can go four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| If to get to the right answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| to get to the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| So I'm going to introduce that as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| We have a substitute motion on the floor to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| if you would explain to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| what tabling the motion exactly would mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| so that we're all fully understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| of what that motion would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Well, generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| if you're not going to continue the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| to a date certain by tabling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| it basically holds it in abeyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| there's no action taken indefinitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| until such time as you bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| And we could bring it back at any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Would the maker of the motion need to bring it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| or could any member of the body bring it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| Well, it would be once you ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| if it passes then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| anyone who was on the affirmative side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| can vote to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| I just want to make sure we're all in clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| I think Commissioner Norman had his last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| He wants to be last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| He had asked that he be last to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| I'm probably ready to speak now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| since it's under the sub motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| So I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| I don't know how much of the speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| I want to delete now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| since we're where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| I certainly think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| I think most of what I wanted to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| was the political process somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| and I'm just talking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Y'all can listen in if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| And this is kind of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| I mean, I'm giving you a bird's eye view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| from my standpoint politically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| because I've been involved so intimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| with the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| And that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| you know, 60 days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| we came in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| and we did the political thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| We read the tea leaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| and we didn't feel like we had the votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| and so we tried to work for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| 60 day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| so we could come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| live to fight another day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| And so we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| And in that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| you know, a couple of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| several things have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| But from the commission's standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| the thing that you would have to be blind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| not to see is the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| that Mr. Hulk was just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| We have a three year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| We wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| and basically a month or so before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| two months before the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| it gets to NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| I mean, it gets hammered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| with every possible argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| Now, I've got a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| my minister at church had a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| he used an analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| If you go to Chuck E. Cheese,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| they have this game called Whack-A-Mole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| and the little mole pops up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| and you've got to hit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| This has been the strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| it's been a very effective strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| a very effective technique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| by the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| They have constantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| for six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| we have battled every obstacle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| they throw at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Here comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| it's a taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Here comes notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Here comes rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| It's overreaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| It takes this off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| That's what Mr. Stevens just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| Those are all misstatements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| It doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| how many times you say them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| they're still misstatements of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| And what's amazing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| that the people who did the work on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| they did the research on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| they did the background for the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| these are credible sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| which we can verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| But the opponents to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| can just make stuff up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| and say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| And we've got to bop that mole back down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| every time they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| And so we've been playing bop a mole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| whack a mole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| for months and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| And that's all we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| We've got documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| at the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| that just address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| all our FAQs or all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| it's just whacking moles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| That's all we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| I've been a very frustrated fellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| And this isn't about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| And Ms. Askew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| has had to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| my frustration a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| And she's been patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| Thank you, Robin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| for being patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| anger comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| When you feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| you've been lied about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| and your work has been misrepresented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| it's hard to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| it's hard to take over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| And then when this happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| and it just happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| we do all this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| and then obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| the powers that be say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| This has to be killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| This has got to be killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| And, boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| they bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| They bring it with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| the press releases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| it's just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| The onslaught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Against this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| and this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| which we commissioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| We said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| Everybody knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| there's big problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| If you don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| there's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| just go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| to your nearest creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| We don't have any creeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| in here in the city anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| that are not suffocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| with sediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| and scoured out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| so no self-respecting person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| would step into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| It's a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| It's a travesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Biblical words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| for what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| to the hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| and the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| It's an abomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| It's a desecration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| Those are the only words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| that are sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| to describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| what is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| I've spent my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| so I have an intense interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| so here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| Now we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| And I read the editorial today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| And they did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| The news sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| did a pretty good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| describing the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| and had the highlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| pretty much on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| They just missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| the conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| They just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| we can't slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| the engines of commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| The engines of commerce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| I mean, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| That's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| That's what government does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| We are restraining bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| This is a hugely risky endeavor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| to develop these sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| We know the economics of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| It does not work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| And the suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| the adjacent suggestion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| send it back for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| Oh my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| Are you kidding me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| It went to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| They're the specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| The MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| They spent months on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| We had one guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| who was the opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| Overwhelming vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| to support this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| by the specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| Hey guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| and generic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| hey guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| we are told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| that we're to rely on the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| Our first lesson is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| we can't be specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| in all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| We've got to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| we've got to rely on the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| the specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| the professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| that do this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| And that's what the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| the staff and the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| which is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| they're the buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| for the bureaucracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| so-called bureaucracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| of the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| And God bless every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| They have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5771)|
| 1:36:20| and invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| an incredible amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Mr. Donaldson has allowed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| all of this staff time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| for us to develop this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| I mean, it's just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| after the ringing endorsement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| by the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| only the Caterpillar dealer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| only the Caterpillar dealer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Oh, and one of the guys that sleeps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| But the Caterpillar dealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| And then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| 11-2, MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| ringing endorsement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| and its proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| it's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| It's amazing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| It's been an unbelievable ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| unbelievable process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| So I suppose I'll support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| And, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| if it fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| I'll reintroduce the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| to approve this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| If the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| I'll speak later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| to what I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| about the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| because that's not the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| I'm going to vote against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| tabling the plan this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5860)|
| 1:37:50| And the reason is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| is that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| some very good people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| that have taken time out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| on their evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| that have come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Some of them have paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| to park down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| They've all had to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| a fair distance to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| If we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| if we had a mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| which we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| and I'll speak to that later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| if we had a mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| of bringing the people together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| over the next couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| to see what we agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| and to see what we disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| and work that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| I would vote to table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| But we don't have that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| as we just heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| So I think that what we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| is to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| and vote on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| I'll speak later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| when that motion's on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| as to my feelings about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| But I think we should go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| and do this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| I really just can't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| what's going to be accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| by tabling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| If we vote it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| something's accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| If we vote it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| something's accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| But just to put it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| a little bit longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| when we can't do anything about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| I think it's almost disrespectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| to the time for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| that came down here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| I was going to kind of go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| with what Dr. Briggs was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| If I get my months correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| they're all coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| But in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| we had a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| I was at the workshop, Tony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| we had in the small assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| Was it January or February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Anyway, we had discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| in January or February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| And the statement was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| a delay at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| was a win for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| I hate that we have wins and losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| but we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| And so then the very next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| the proponents asked for a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| And so it turned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| the Commissioner Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| just spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| we didn't have the votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| so we delayed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| But we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| I mean, there's people up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| that like parts of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| There's things in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| There's a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| that I really have heartburn with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| But there's things in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| And we can't go about fixing the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| until we vote it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| And so that's why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| being against the delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| is not that I want to kill the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| Being against the delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| is because we've got to get it fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| and put it behind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| so people can do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| And I think the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| that need to be on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| are MPC and codes enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| and home builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| and neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| Everybody needs to be involved in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| that wasn't involved in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| But we can't change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| a single letter in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| unless it's either voted up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| or voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| And so that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| I'm against tabling the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| let me interrupt the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| I am now faced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| with a family emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| The storm that blew through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| just a short while ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| has knocked down a tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| on my wife's car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| who's not too far from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| It was blocked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| by electrical wires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| which have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| And I need to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| to a family matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| if we're going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| on tabling this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| and we get to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| within the next 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| I will stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| for the vote on tabling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| But as soon as this vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| on this motion is made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| I will be leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Do you have insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| I think I'd respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| I'm sure he would like to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| But Commissioner Brawls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| will hear your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| and then we'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| I would like to get through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| and so Dave will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| an opportunity to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| Commissioner Brawls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| if you'd like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| if you'd like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| I would like to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| and so Dave will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| an opportunity to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| I am going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| in favor of tabling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| because Tony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| who seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| and I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| as a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| if he is comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| then I am as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| I know that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| how much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| they have put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| and I'm still concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| by the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| of misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| and erroneous statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| tabling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| does not negate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| the input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| that we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| from our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| who are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| but it might give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6117)|

| 1:54:57| Yes, sir. Mr. Hill, what is the plan for the location there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6897)|
| 1:55:04| Do you know what they're planning on putting in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| We're actually going to down zone it to actually do housing units, actually duplexes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6906)|
| 1:55:16| Okay. I thought it said to go to general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6916)|

| 1:55:28| This is Kate Rowe, developers, is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| The current plan designation is mixed use, which does not permit the commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| so that's why they had to get a plan amendment to allow them to request CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| So the current designation is MU mixed use and agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| The request is for a C commercial designation and CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6948)|
| 1:55:55| He just said he's going to down zone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| Well, next to it is CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| We actually have property there that's CA already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| But we may do some duplexes and some office type buildings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| I don't think he's on the right case, or we're not on the right case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6970)|

| 1:56:26| The sector plan is to take it to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=6986)|

| 1:56:55| We're asking for commercial because the property is on commercial there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| and it also backs up to the golf course there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| So you're asking, you're not going to put a residential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425zoningpart3?start=7025)|
